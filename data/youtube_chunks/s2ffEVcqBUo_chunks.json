      "text": "I'm worried about Trump's announcement today. He has an announcement today at 2 p.m. Eastern time. I'm going to show you what I think that announcement is and how it can affect the markets. Also, talking about announcements, we had the inflation. It's not really an announcement. It's an inflation reading. We expected 2.7%, we got 2.7%, and so the market hardly moved. Well, actually, no, the market did move. But if you wanted to catch that move, I actually want to show you a lot of our members actually did catch that move, right? So, if you look at what actually happened in that chart, I'll take it to a three-minute chart. You can see that when the inflation numbers actually came out, we actually did spike to 92,500 and then we pulled back, and then we spiked up again. I'm going to show you how you can catch moves like that. And then I want to talk about this commodities super cycle that's actually happening and whether or not we can trade it, whether or not we've missed the boat, and what the best way is to actually get into this commodity super cycle. So, another jam-packed show here on a Tuesday. We got a jam-packed show for you here today. As always, let's get the show on the road, guys. WGY, rise and shine. Lots to talk about today. Tons of stuff to talk about today. At the end of the show, I also want to talk about this Monero run because I think I know what's going on here. I'll show you why. There's a lot of these privacy coins running again. So look, in the first 100, you got Dash, which is now in the first 100, Monero. And then if you look at the top 200, you got Railgun. So a lot going on here. And Zano. Zano, we'll talk about today as well. Lots actually to talk about today. TradFi, altcoins. Yeah. It feels like we're back in a bull market, but we're not back in a bull market. The reason why we're not back in the bull market is very simple. And this is what most people are actually missing here today. In fact, before I show you what most people are actually missing here today, you know what to do. Hit the like button, please. Just hit the like button, please. It helps us get distribution if you're not subscribed. Well, you can't be in the show and then be commenting in the chat, bro. Like you and Bruno, I'm on to you guys. I can see you guys. I see you guys every single day. It's like my biggest fan club, but they also work for me. They know that your salaries will be paid regardless, guys. Your salaries will be paid regardless. Okay, now the price of Bitcoin is starting to move up a little bit. Now, the reason why I said to you that what most people are"

Your salaries will be paid regardless. Okay, now the price of Bitcoin is starting to move up a little bit. Now, the reason why I said to you that what most people are actually missing here is that we actually had a big level for Bitcoin. And the reason why we can't break the 92 level is because if you go zoom out on the daily here, I mean, this is massive. If we get back into this level, then we're back in the upward channel that we've been in since, I mean, you could probably say that that channel extends back to December 2022. And right now, we are back and we are testing that channel. Just look at exactly right now as it stands, we're just over the channel. Now we did break over that channel on the 5th of Jan. We got that 94,000 level and then we rejected. This is a big level. So it's going to take us time to get through this level. When we get through this level, rest assured, it's going to take us up. I think we're definitely going to go back to the $100,000 level. And then I think the key decision point for Bitcoin as to whether we're in a bull market or not in a bull market is on around that $107,000 level. Anyway, let's talk about today. So, the big news of the day, inflation numbers, not such big news because they don't actually really matter. We expected 2.7%. We got 2.7%. CPI was marginally lower than we actually expected. The market didn't really react. Why? Because there's nothing really to react to. Regardless of what the inflation numbers are, Powell ain't increasing or ain't raising or decreasing rates when he's basically got a subpoena against him and he's being subpoenaed at the moment. And so the chances of a rate cut at the January FOMC, 95% no rate cut in January, which is about right. Which is why at face value the inflation numbers don't matter. The reason why you could say they did matter is because remember there was the government shutdown and so they never did a reading in October. In November it wasn't a real reading. It was an imputed reading because they never went into the field and got the inflation numbers. They basically assumed certain numbers and this is the first real data reading. So the relief is that inflation actually is a 2.7% if you listen to them. If you listen to Truflation, inflation's 1.74%. So long story short, this whole inflation thing"

So the relief is that inflation actually is a 2.7% if you listen to them. If you listen to Truflation, inflation's 1.74%. So long story short, this whole inflation thing is pretty much over. Rate cuts still forecast, I think to get two rate cuts this year. But a lot is at play here because of Powell and what's going to happen and who's going to replace him and yesterday's subpoena and everything else that pretty much goes with it. Now, I said to you earlier that some people actually landed up making money at this inflation meeting and I watched it in real time. That's why I want to talk about it today for a second. So who made money? The people who, it was so funny because if you break down, if you look at the inflation number at the Bitcoin chart and you go down to the three-minute chart. So you can see that right here is where the inflation numbers actually came out. See that's where the inflation reading actually came out. You had about four minutes to make money. So you either caught that three-minute candle or you caught that three-minute candle and there was a ton of money to actually be made. Let me explain to you what actually happened here. As the announcement came out, there are algos that are programmed to trade announcements like this, right? So the Algo basically says, listen, if inflation is equal to or below, buy. If inflation is above, sell. That's basically how the Algo actually works. And what these Algos are basically scrambling to do is they're scrambling to get the news first, right? And as soon as the news comes out, the news feed feeds the Algo and the Algo makes the trade. And that's what happened over here. Right? So essentially the Algo got the news here and we went from there. From here we went straight up. We had 3 minutes to make the trade and then we went straight back down again. Now if you want to be competitive with these algos, you need to be getting news at the millisecond. Milliseconds matter when you're trading this. That's why we built the News Terminal. You know how this News Terminal works. I showed it to you guys a lot last year, but today it was great because I was actually watching people make money. As soon as the interest rate news came out, if you would have traded the interest rate news immediately, you could have gone long or short within a"

I showed it to you guys a lot last year, but today it was great because I was actually watching people make money. As soon as the interest rate news came out, if you would have traded the interest rate news immediately, you could have gone long or short within a matter of milliseconds and that would have given you the advantage. Now again, this news terminal is I think one of the most powerful tools that you can actually use if you want to be catching moves, especially now in the market when the market's so quiet, it's very hard to catch these moves. If you want to, there is a link here which gives it to you for $99 a month for the first 12 months. Now, usually it's $199, but today I'm going to give it to you guys for $99. If you're unhappy after the first month, email me. I'll give you back your money. But I think trading speed, trading news now in a market cycle now is a great place to be. And as you can see, I think now the market's actually starting to run. Anyway, so that is the inflation news. That's how you make money on inflation news and other news. You got to be quick. The only way to be quick is to use a terminal like this. The thing with a news terminal is that you're talking about milliseconds here. Like this one was 497 milliseconds and this is 350 milliseconds. You're talking milliseconds to actually catch the trades. So yeah, and you can see what it does is it already highlights the tokens that could actually move. And then if you want to buy, it's like literally, I don't know if I've got money in this account, but let's try. Okay, I don't have money in this account. If I had money in this account, would literally go straight in and you'd be trading in a matter of milliseconds. All right, so that's the first part of it and that's the first announcement of the day. It's the inflation announcement. Yeah, I saw this and I don't know how big this announcement is, but there is one thing that I'm actually a little bit worried about in the markets and one thing that I guess could ruin the pump that we're currently experiencing. And I really hope we don't ruin the pump, but there is one thing that could actually ruin the pump and that is this.

And I really hope we don't ruin the pump, but there is one thing that could actually ruin the pump and that is this. I don't know if you guys saw this, but Trump, he tweeted, he went on Truth Social yesterday and he said: \"The actual numbers that we could have to pay back if for any reason the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on tariffs would be hundreds of billions of dollars. And that doesn't include the amount that we have to pay back to countries and companies that would require for the investments they are making building plants, factories, equipment for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of tariffs. When these investments were added, we were talking about trillions of dollars. It could be a complete mess and almost impossible for our country to pay.\" He's almost saying if the Supreme Court rules against us and says that we have to pay, it could cost a trillion dollars. He says anyone who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood the answer to this large and complex question. It's not impossible, but if it were, it would be dollars that would be so large that would take us many years to figure out the number. And we're talking about even who, when, and where to pay. Remember, America shines brightly when the world shines brightly. In other words, if a Supreme Court rules against the United States of America, we are screwed. So Trump's basically saying that if the Supreme Court rules against him when it comes to tariffs, it's going to be such a scrambled egg, it's going to be such a big problem that there's no way... that it's going to cost America millions. And he says, \"We are screwed.\" Okay, that's not good because tell you why it's not good. There's a 27% chance that they're going to rule in favor of Trump tariffs, which means that there's a 73% chance that they're going to rule away from Trump tariffs. If you know that there's a 73% chance that the Supreme Court is going to rule against you. Now remember the Supreme Court's not making any decisions based on Trump Truth Social Posts. They're making decisions based on the rule of law and the letter of the law. And he says if they rule against me, we're screwed. And there's a 75% chance that they rule against him. Hold on a second. He's basically saying that if they rule against him, we are screwed. Therefore, market should crash. Okay? If the president says, \"Listen, if this happens, we're screwed.\" And there's a"

If the president says, \"Listen, if this happens, we're screwed.\" And there's a 75% chance of it happening and then it happens, the markets are going to react badly. And this is what I'm worried about because on Wednesday, which is tomorrow, we could get a ruling in the Trump tariffs. And if it's not on Wednesday, it's by the end of January. But what Trump is saying, he's saying if it happens, we're screwed. And if we're screwed, then I don't want to be in the markets. I don't want to be in markets if Trump's telling me it may be screwed. Now, what can happen in the ruling? One, they may rule that tariffs were affirmed. Then there could be a complete invalidation of tariffs, or there could be some tariffs were legal, some tariffs were not legal. Right now, I don't think that they're screwed because it's only $139 billion. Now, Trump's bringing in all these factories and everything else. Ultimately, the legal or illegal tariffs are $139 billion in 2025. And this is the number that they have to repay back. I think he's over-sensationalizing it because he kind of wants to say to the Supreme Court, look, if you make a bad decision on whenever the ruling day is, if you make a bad decision, then you're going to crash markets. And he wants the American people to know that, you know, he warned them, etc. But, you know, justices and judges don't make decisions like that. They make decisions based on fact, rule of law, etc. And, you know, I just think that it was a... I mean, he's obviously highly calculated. He's much smarter than me. He's obviously much, much smarter than me. He's a better golfer than I am. I don't know. I mean, I was watching actually a video earlier today about him playing golf with his granddaughter. He's a very good golfer. But I think that now he's playing a very, very crazy game. Yes, I'm worried. I don't think today is going to be an announcement about that, but let's hope that something like that actually happens. I want to talk a little bit about what we spoke about yesterday and the Powell Fed chair being attacked or subpoenaed around perjury and potential perjury.

I want to talk a little bit about what we spoke about yesterday and the Powell Fed chair being attacked or subpoenaed around perjury and potential perjury. And what's happening is now that basically all the European banks have come out and said, \"Look, we stand with Powell. We stand in full solidarity with the Fed Reserve system and with his chairman Jerome Powell.\" He and basically saying that they stand behind him. It's people like Christine Lagarde, Andrew Bailey, and all the Europeans as well as the Koreans, the Brazilians, basically all the central bankers around the world have basically come out and said we stand in support of Powell. Right. Now I read this and it's very, very true. Mert says, \"In theory, crypto should have printed on the news of the Fed instability. In practice, we're all degens.\" Basically saying, \"Listen, it doesn't make sense. It does not make sense that what we got the news that we got yesterday and the Fed is acting... and Bitcoin is acting like Bitcoin is acting.\" I mean, it's probably acting a little bit better today without the news. 97,750, which is great. Now we, as you can see on this line, we're actually back in the channel now, which is fantastic. Now we just need to close there for a couple of days. Anyway, so long story short, the commodity super cycle continues. Just look at silver. Silver absolutely acting like an altcoin, like an altcoin. Gold has actually outperformed the stock market now for six months. And you know what the funny thing is? The funny thing is that when you start thinking about like, you know, this is us guys. We we are the guys that are supposed to be posting memes like this. We are the guys that's supposed to be living these memes because we chose crypto and crypto is the riskiest asset class which is supposed to give us the biggest returns. And you know who's actually doing this now? It's the commodities guys. Now when I think of commodities guys, I think of my friends at Kitco News. Like guys, it's these guys that are doing this right now. It's like I can't believe that I used to watch Kitco News and I used to think to myself, you know, I'm so sorry for you guys that you guys invested in gold and that you guys are boomers, etc. And now these are the same people that are pretty much getting these kind of returns. And so like I'm getting this image in my head of those guys actually doing this and I'm like, that's supposed to be us. You know that meme? It's like that could have"

And so like I'm getting this image in my head of those guys actually doing this and I'm like, that's supposed to be us. You know that meme? It's like that could have been us but you chose crypto. Like, you know, that meme it says like, \"Honey that could have been us but...\" Yeah, now Joanne who's one of the regulars to our show, Joanne, we acknowledge you, we appreciate you, she says, \"It won't always be them.\" And that's my whole thesis here. So number one, I want to talk about the super cycle. So why is gold and copper and silver having a super cycle right now? Two reasons. The first thing is they found an amazing product-market fit. And the product-market fit is the fact that number one, they are the original protection against government shenanigans money. Two, with the AI trade and the new trade that there is, and let's just call it the AI trade, but it extends to things like AI data centers, drones, basically new technologies. We cannot get enough of these commodities to actually power the chips, the data centers, etc. And so when you combine number one and number two, which is number one that they found product-market fit in being sound money, and number two, you find a product-market fit when it comes to data centers, and then the price goes up. And as the price goes up, what happens? Basically that's an advert for what you like. Price is the best advertisement. So as soon as your price goes up, people FOMO into it. When they got the returns in gold, where did they go? They basically said, \"Okay, we got the returns in gold now.\" And now gold generally... So if you think about gold bull markets, gold bull markets aren't like crypto bull markets which are one-year bull markets. Gold bull markets are usually 10 years. And generally what happens with gold is that they have a blowoff top. Now I want to show you the chart. So I mean that's what a gold bull market actually looks like. You know you went down for 22 and a half years, you have a 10-year bull market, and then basically what you realize is that the blowoff top or the peaks on gold are quite quick in gold terms. So basically you get like a two-year stint in terms of like two years and three months. The average breakout here is two years and three months of basically gold. Now, what we're seeing here is we're seeing that gold is"

So basically you get like a two-year stint in terms of like two years and three months. The average breakout here is two years and three months of basically gold. Now, what we're seeing here is we're seeing that gold is very, very oversold in terms of the RSIs, which it always does when we get to the tops. But these tops can last for very long. As I've showed you, these tops can last for 791 days, but then what happens is the money moves to silver and then from silver, the money moves to the other commodities. It's very similar to this chart over here which is the old Secrets of Crypto chart. Let me actually show it to you because I know I've got it here somewhere. If X is working. I don't know, X has been a little bit temperamental these days. Let's quickly just try and find you that Secrets of Crypto chart. Generally, the researchers would be watching the show but guess they don't watch the show as closely anymore. So this is exactly what we're experiencing, but we're only experiencing it right now in commodities. So we had the gold run, which was their Bitcoin. Silver is their ETH, and it's outperformed gold by a lot. So gold goes up 70%, silver goes up 200, 300%. Which is basically how the flow of money used to happen in crypto. And then you go to the large cap alts, and in this case, it's the large cap commodities. And then you go to places like copper, like uranium, like lithium, and all of those are actually flying, right? Now, I mentioned to you yesterday that I actually took a trade on copper, right? So, why did I take the trade on copper? I'm going to leave this. It's a long tweet around the copper thesis from it's called Value with Prem. It's quite a big account. I don't actually follow, I must follow it. Also, I see the same patterns happening on copper as happened on silver where first the silver broke out, then the silver miners broke out, now the copper miners are actually breaking out. I wonder if I can actually show you. I don't know if I remember the code, but there is an ETF of silver miners, and I want to show you... let's see if I can find that silver miners ETF. Okay, maybe it's this one, but I'm sure that this one will show us the breakout. So, you see they consolidate and then basically you have that breakout.

Now, if you look at the copper pattern, it's exactly the same pattern. So, that's the pattern over there. That's the trade. Now, how do you take this trade if you don't... Yeah, someone says uranium will do very well. Doesn't matter. Right now, we're in a commodity super cycle. I want to talk about this commodity super cycle for a second. So, number one about a commodity super cycle is it's the same as an altcoin super cycle. They run for a long time and the majority of the returns come at the very end when we're in the blowoff top. Make no mistake that right now we are in that blowoff top and so you could expect a correction. The thing with corrections in commodities is that they're not as violent as corrections in Bitcoin. Why? Unlike crypto and Bitcoin, when Bitcoin starts to crash, there's no bottom. And the reason why there's no bottom is because you don't actually need Bitcoin for anything other than to protect your money. When you talk about commodities, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, uranium, lithium, you need them for actual manufacturing, whether it's weapons, whether it's chips, whatever it is that you need. And so there's always a bottom because there's natural demand for the components. So unlike crypto, when crypto starts to crash, everyone says, \"Oh my god, this is going to zero.\" When commodities crash, it's a different type of crash. Why? Because it doesn't go to zero. It goes to the notional value of what people need, to the consumption value or the usage value. And so that is why it's a nice hedge to have in your portfolio specifically because we know how these market cycles play out. As I said before, make no mistake that we are at the end of a... we are at some point in the end of a blowoff top on commodities. The question is, where are we in that blowoff top on commodities and are we too late to basically get in? I'm still taking some bets. I bought silver a long time ago. I did tell you on the show when I landed up buying it. Now, I've actually gone out and I've bought platinum. How do you buy platinum using your crypto money? So, as I mentioned to you guys yesterday and I mentioned to you guys again, you can go to Bybit and in Bybit under the TradFi market"

So, as I mentioned to you guys yesterday and I mentioned to you guys again, you can go to Bybit and in Bybit under the TradFi market over here. So, if you go to TradFi, what you can see is you can actually get copper. So basically that's copper. Now you buy copper in lots. Okay? So it's copper lots. You can buy gold, you can buy silver, etc. And you can buy them on leverage, but you buy them here. See, I've got $50,000 of margin. I can use the value of the margin. I can actually buy these copper lots if you want to do that. Now, listen carefully because it's the first 50 people only. If you want to trade copper or any commodity on Bybit today, the first 50 people who take a trade will get a $50 trading voucher and you can use that voucher to take a $1,000 long position on any one of the commodities or actually any one of the tokens only. Oh, they changed it. Okay, it's the first 100 people. So, today amazing specials both in the news terminal and actually on trading commodities. As I said to you before, we are investors. We're crypto investors primarily, but we are investors. And if right now the commodities are acting like crypto and we understand market psyche, market psychology, we know that this blowoff top can carry on for a long time. It can hurt a lot of people on the way down. But remember, when commodities crash, they don't crash like crypto crashes. They don't go 90% down and go down to zero. And they can't do that now. Not when you're in the age of drones, AI super cycle where they need all the copper for the data centers and all the silver and whatever else. So I think it's a good trade. I think if you're one of the first hundred people to cash in on this thing, you get a $1,000 position. Which I think is a very cool position. Okay. Now, I want to talk about this, right? So, Mert's tweet here which said, \"In theory, we should have printed on news of the Fed's instability. In practice, we're all degens.\" Okay. Why do I want to talk about it? Because it's frustrating that crypto hasn't moved. And you could say like 2025 was a really, really bad year for crypto, but actually it wasn't. If you look at 2025 and you look up until October 10th, everything was fine. We were aligned"

We were probably about to have a breakout as you can see, but then we crashed. And when we crashed, they went parabolic and we just didn't come to the party. So think about it like this. Think about like you're going to a friend's party and everyone's drinking, right? Everyone's drinking and then like at 10:10 p.m. you basically take like 60 shots in a row and something breaks inside you. But then you can't carry on for the rest of the party when they all go and hit all-time highs later. You don't hit all-time highs. You basically go home and you're throwing up and it's just not a good situation, right? That's what happened. So, think about last year as the party. Think about 10:10 as 10:10 p.m. And think about something broke in crypto and it broke really badly. Someone spiked our drink. Someone destroyed our market. We destroyed our market. We destroyed everything. Thing is, we've only been moving sideways for 90 days. And like Michael Saylor said, he said, \"Look, you cannot measure the performance of a market because of a 90-day downswing.\" I think, and I'm gonna double down on this. I'm going to say my prediction is that on a two-year time horizon, I think that when we look back at this on a two-year time horizon, I think that Bitcoin actually outperforms silver and gold and we'll forget about the last 90 days. That's exactly what I think's basically going to happen. That's my thesis. In the meantime, I am hedging my bets and I'm taking some commodities and I'm putting the profits into Bitcoin. Now, as Fred Krueger says, he says things don't move in a straight line. Bitcoin passed silver in market cap in July. So in July, Bitcoin had a bigger market cap than silver. And then silver did a 2x. So what's going to happen next? World markets are running. Stock markets are running. Silver's running. Gold's running. Commodities running. Lithium's running. Everything's running. So my bet is we're going to get that catch-up trade now. And what makes me more hopeful is that we know that when these guys actually top, then we get the big catch-up trade here. So maybe what we need is we need the commodities to start correcting as you can see happened here"

So maybe what we need is we need the commodities to start correcting as you can see happened here and happened here and then Bitcoin actually starts running. Hopefully, hopefully that happens or at least that's the thesis that I'm pretty much looking at. Let me know what you think. The long-term thesis is solid. It is solid. Now let's talk about the altcoins. So, I mean as I said to you guys the big narrative right now is privacy. I mean so I think what's happened is the following. I think pump.fun is also a good one to be buying. So I think here's what happened. I think that the market punished Zcash. Zcash was the front runner for the privacy coin. And then the other day we had those shenanigans with the dev team leaving and stuff like that. And I think a lot of people actually caught a fright. And because those people actually caught a fright, what you can see is that they went and scrambled to Monero, they're scrambling to Dash, they're scrambling to Rail and a whole lot of others. And so I think that this is a short-term move between one privacy coin and another privacy coin. And I think the narrative of privacy is going to be a very, very big narrative. And you have to be in that narrative. First, it's going to be the privacy money. And you can see that running. I think Zcash is going to have a massive catch-up trade back to Monero and they're going to align again and then you can see things like Rail, those are all private money. And then the next sector is going to be privacy privacy. So things like Canton, ZK Sync. And today I actually bought a little bit of this thing called Zano which is a layer one open-source smart contract which is by default private. I posted it actually in Front Runners. I posted it quite a few. Yesterday we took a trade on Monero in Front Runners, you can see it here. Yeah, this is when I traded last night. It was under $600. Now it's $675 or at least that happened. And then I took a small position on this Zano at about $10. Why? Because I just think this privacy narrative is going to explode. And this is one of the tokens that I actually want to have exposure to. Yes, there is like a nasty 15-minute candle. People are de-risking from Zcash"

People are de-risking from Zcash because they realize they're overexposed on Zcash. They're moving out of Zcash into some of the other privacy players, but all the big names, Barry Silbert, the Winklevoss brothers, everyone, all the big names are still behind Zcash. So, that's the thesis that I'm actually playing. Anyway, remember guys, if you want the news, the thing, $100, $1,000 open position if you use the Bybit first 100 users. 24/7 terminal, I mean, on days like this, the terminal is like, you pay $99. If you don't make your $99 back in the first month, then just email me. I'll give you back your money. Anyway, I'll see you guys again tomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends."
