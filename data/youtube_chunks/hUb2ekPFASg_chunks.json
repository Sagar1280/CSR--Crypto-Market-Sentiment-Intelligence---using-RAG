      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coinb Trading. Today, we're going to talk about the real reason why the crypto market is crashing and how low prices could go. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different. And if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, if you guys have been looking into the headlines trying to figure out why the crypto market is down, I'm sure you've seen a whole bunch of headlines related to the kind of tensions between uh the US and Europe as it relates to Greenland. Basically, the United States wants to either buy Greenland or take it by military force or a whole bunch of, you know, different theories, I guess, as to how they could get it. But, of course, Europe isn't a fan of that. And you've probably seen headlines about Europe planning a quote unquote trade bazooka against the United States, which you know, it kind of implies that Europe has some massive economic leverage over the US, which spoiler alert, it doesn't really. But the thing is, guys, that this doesn't seem to be the reason. And that's simply because overnight uh we had reporting from the New York Times basically saying that no, there's not going to be a retaliation. There's actually going to be negotiation uh relative to uh Trump's in relation rather to Trump's threat around Greenland. And not only that, guys, but if you actually look closely, you'll notice that that crypto prices started falling the moment that Asia markets opened. Um, so that suggests that the issue is not related to Europe. It's not related to the US. Uh, it's something related to Asia. And if you guys have been keeping up with my content and you watched my video on Saturday, you'll know that it seems to be related to Japan and the Japanese yen and also the Japanese bond market. You can see here that over the last day, uh, Japanese bond yields have started breaking out. And you might be wondering, why is this a problem? Well, basically when Japanese bond yields are rising, this basically puts pressure on bond markets around the world and you can see here that also uh we're starting to see a spike in US government bond yields as well. Uh which is not surprising that it's kind of corresponding to the spike in Japanese bond yields. And what that basically does is it basically makes debt and put very simply guys, what that basically means is that when bond yields around the world are starting to rise, that means that debts are becoming more expensive. That means liquidity is contracting and that basically puts pressure on the markets. Uh, as I explained on Saturday, and I actually explained this a little bit more in depth for Quin Bureau Club members, uh, even today in a research feed post, basically it looks like Japan is going to be getting a snap election soon. And, you know, they're saying, \"Oh, it's because so they can take more political power or whatever, like whatever politics.\" But I think that's all an excuse, guys. I think the real reason why there's a snap election here is because the uh, Japanese government, they still haven't passed a spending budget for 2026. And if bond yields and the and if bond yields are already spiking and the Japanese yen is already crashing, imagine what's going to happen when they announce their budget for 2026. That budget is probably going to be big. The bond yields will rise even higher. The Japanese yen will fall even lower. That will cause the US dollar to rise. That will cause uh US bond yields and other bond yields to rise and it will basically suck liquidity out of the markets globally and put pressure on the markets. Um, but one thing that I mentioned on Saturday's in Saturday's video and also for Coin Bureau Club members is that this process, you know, of something breaking of, you know, there being kind of a liquidity drain, it's not going to be immediate. I don't think it's going to happen right away."

I don't think it's going to happen right away. I still think there's a little bit of wiggle room here for there to be a little bit of like some intervention or help uh, you know, from US authorities to make sure that this bond yield situation in Japan, in the US, and elsewhere doesn't get out of control. So, I wouldn't say it's going to evolve into something, you know, quite severe in the short term. Although in the coming weeks and coming months, I do think it could get a lot worse. With that being said, it's about time we took a look uh at the the price charts here. So on Bitcoin, it's actually really interesting, guys. And if you're watching a lot of analysis on XA the same way that I am, you probably saw an analysis similar to this where a lot of people think that there's going to be another drop for Bitcoin down below 90,000, not only to close the CME gap, but to kind of complete this bottoming uh process that we've seen since November. And it kind of makes sense, like you could imagine that it's kind of like a mirror image. uh you you could say like the middle of the mirror was sometime in December and then you have basically an almost identical pattern on both sides of this mirror if that makes any sense where uh you know again back in November dropping down to around 80,000 and everyone is assuming well then that means we're going to get a drop to around uh you know 88,000 as well uh into the 80,000 range sometime later in January before a continuation higher which is certainly possible but the thing is you you'll notice that whereas previously um well I mean I guess technically even before here um in this pattern it was always a higher low. Um, and that basically, you know, showing that we're in a in an uptrend. So, even if we do get a pullback here, I don't necessarily think it's going to go very low. Could it go down to re again to close that CME gap that's still open somewhere around 88,000? Sure. Um, to get a little tag there, you know, just a wick down to that level continuation higher. That's always possible. I guess long-winded way of saying is like that would be the kind of lowest uh price to wash here in the short term. But personally, like in the super short term, let's say over the next couple of days, you can see that Bitcoin has fallen down to the Ballinger band moving average on the daily. I do expect there to be at least a small bounce from that level, maybe back to around 95,000. And if we do get a continuation lower, we would only get that later. So, for example, later this week, we would get a continuation lower. Uh, and then I do still expect a continuation higher into the end of the month and into February. This is due to a lag from uh the liquidity injections from the Fed and the Treasury from last year because that liquidity injection acts with a three-month lag. So, liquidity injections from November and December, you're going to start seeing that in the crypto market some coming in sometime around February uh time frame. Of course, we're also going to have the larger than um the large I think it's what is it tax tax returns. The larger tax returns are going to start coming in in February as well. So, that will also boost the market. I believe the average um increase in tax returns for the average person will be around $1,000. So, it's basically like another STEMI check that'll also boost the markets as we head into February. But again, in the short term, same idea with Ethereum."

So, it's basically like another STEMI check that'll also boost the markets as we head into February. But again, in the short term, same idea with Ethereum. Same idea with this mirroring price action. Maybe we're seeing history repeat here. But in the short term, I do think that Ethereum has caught support around the Ballinger band moving average on the daily. a small bounce of some kind I think is likely in the next couple of days up to around 3,300 and then at that stage we see okay are we going to get this kind of a bottoming pattern that you know many traders on X are starting to see now um and you know the more and more people that have that thesis in mind thinking that oh we're going to get a drop you know down below 3K for Ethereum to close that CME gap and then continue higher um I'm still not 100% sure of that especially this 88k CME gap for Bitcoin and the 3K CME gap for Ethereum that's from New Year's Day and uh and as I was explaining in a previous video. I'm not so sure that CME gaps um from uh from New Year's Day are have the same magnitude as CME gaps from the weekend because it has to do with mechanics around like basis trades and a whole bunch of stuff. Um but anyways, uh long story short, guys, is yes, uh the crypto market is is under pressure. This has nothing to do with the stuff in Greenland, contrary to what you're reading in the media. Even mainstream media is reporting now that there's not going to be retaliation. It's going to be negotiation. Uh the fact that we saw crypto prices fall when Asian marks markets open suggests that it's a problem related to Asia. This spike in Japanese bond yields is probably going to start putting more pressure on other bond markets including the US bond market which again when bond yields go up, interest rates go up, that causes basically liquidity to contract globally, whether it's in Asia or the US or elsewhere. The reason why we're seeing these issues in Japan basically has to do with the fact that Japan has so much debt. They need to get their themselves out of that debt. But as I mentioned in on Saturday, it's kind of like a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. If they support the yen, then that involves basically selling US bonds and US assets, which would basically put pressure on US markets. But if they fail to support the yen, if the yen just continues crashing and bond yields continue uh rising in in Japan, uh then this would also basically cause the US dollar to rise, which would put pressure on liquidity globally as well. So, it's kind of again like a lose-lose, but I do think that uh in the short term they will be able to kind of contain things, keep things contained kind of like what we've seen here over the last couple of months. Granted that you know this rise in Japanese bond yields again just further to my point uh when we saw this rise in Japanese bond yields that did put pressure on the market significantly throughout November uh and and I guess to a lesser extent in December because you can see the rise kind of slowed down. But when we got that spike in bond yields in November, that's kind of concrete proof that tells you that again in November was really brutal for crypto. that spike in Japanese bond yields. If we're seeing that repeat again, then don't be surprised that we're going to see pressure on the crypto markets, you know, going into the end of this month. But again, I'll repeat that I do think that uh authorities will kind of intervene, get get these bond yields under control."

We'll get a continuation higher and then maybe sometime in February, March, maybe late February, early March, something like that. That's when the the it'll basically become too much to handle. And again, they're trying to kick the can down the road with this snap election. Uh and uh we're going to have to wait and see what happens. But again, super short-term here. Next couple of days, uh there's probably going to be a bounce after having so many, you know, down days and a retest of the Ballinger band moving average on the daily. So, small bounce over the next couple of days. Then we see, do we get a continuation lower into the end of the week, uh into this zone that everyone is watching below 90K for Bitcoin, below 3K for for Ethereum, or do we just get a bounce from that level and a continuation higher? The fact of the matter is we're we're just going to have to wait and see. And do keep in mind guys that today is a holiday in the US. So there's probably not going to be too much uh momentum like immediately like in the next 24 hours. It will probably be somewhat choppy. Um we we probably won't be getting this bounce. Let's say later today or immediately now. That'll probably come in the next couple of days once US markets open tomorrow.
