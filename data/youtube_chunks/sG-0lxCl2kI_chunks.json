      "text": "Bitcoin is at a crucial price point as always, but more importantly, it lost support in our bare flag. This is something that we've been covering for weeks, and now it's literally on the moment of truth. The last two days, Bitcoin did not successfully close inside of this bare flag. Now, if it does, this flag becomes a little bit more flimsy instead of it having the expected outcome, which is falling a lot lower. There are four other charts that we need to be watching that will tell us if this chart is most likely going to return back up or if it's going to fall lower. All that here on Coin Bureau Trading. What's up? My name is Aaron Dishner from the Better Traders. You're watching Coin Bureau Trading. Go ahead and subscribe now. Like the video. Let's get into it. Now, we need to talk about this. I've seen some people leaving comments. They're a little bit unsure like, \"Wait, how is this a bare flag? The price is going up.\" Uh yeah, that's what bare flags do. They trick you. You have higher lows and you have higher highs. Higher low, higher high, higher low. Except when that higher low structure is broken, then we have a big problem. That is a breach or a break of support. And this is where the bare flag gets its name from. After we're done pivoting back and forth, however long it takes, eventually there's going to be a loss of support because that's what happens on bare flags. There's a bearish outcome. The next thing that happens next is we get a test of previously lost support which confirms it as resistance and the price falls a lot further. Now, I'll get more into targets in a minute, but you have to understand that if for some wild reason, Bitcoin closes inside of this support level, it actually invalidates this bare flag. So, if you're a bull, you want to be buying Bitcoin. You want to be rooting and tooting for BTC to go up a lot higher because right now it's still on a make or break level. I personally am expecting it to break to the downside. I shared earlier this week in the Better Traders Club that bare flags have a 58% probability to play out and I think like an 18% or 14% probability of being invalidated. Meaning that there is a much stronger much more likely outcome of us going lower than us going right back up. But I want to tell you, even if the price happens to go up, we are still destined to go lower. Eventually, we're going to break support and it's going to go lower. Why? Because this is a bare market year. But it's not just because it's a bare market year. The signs have been clear for a long time. The trending breakout indicator or TBO for short has been macro bearish ever since the slow line, the slowest of the four moving averages has started curling down back over here in November. The macro trend continues to point lower. This was my target on the next bounce. This is what I thought would happen next. we get one more push up higher, but unfortunately we lost everything on Tuesday this week because of all the tariff fears and all that fun stuff. So, a lot of us are probably thinking or a lot of you are probably thinking, well, since that all has been, you know, calmed down, why isn't Bitcoin just springing back forth? That's a really good question that you just asked, although I'm kind of interpreting it for you. Well, the reason why it hasn't just sprung right back is because there's no volume to buy the dip right now. There's no excitement. As you know, earlier this week, we saw about $1 billion in leveraged longs wiped out across the board on this pullback on Monday and Tuesday. That was a rough drop. Okay, if this were a bottom, a real big bottom, we should have a massive spike in volume showing us and telling us that, okay, nope, this is a real bottom. See this back over here? This is what a bottom looks like. You want to see a long lower wick, which was a 5% wick, and a massive increase in volume. This is a bottom over here. This is not a bottom. Could Bitcoin still move up? Yes, it could. And we could still see that uh bare flag support level invalidated this week. It's possible, but daily volume is not on our side. Well, what about the weekly time frame?"

Could Bitcoin still move up? Yes, it could. And we could still see that uh bare flag support level invalidated this week. It's possible, but daily volume is not on our side. Well, what about the weekly time frame? Well, the weekly time frame has been in a state of what I call bearish consolidation. We saw the price fall inside of the cloud. If we are using um Ichimoku as well, it would be in a bearish consolidation too. You can see the price is inside of the cloud. Very similar. Okay. And it's also actually in danger of falling below the cloud, which is when according to the Ichimoku cloud, this is when we get into strong bearish mode. We also know from the lagging span back here, the green line, that it already is strong bearish. When this green line is below the price, that's a bad sign. So even if Bitcoin were to push up, it's still in bearish consolidation. It will most likely fall lower and lower and lower. So, even the Ichimoku cloud, which is free, is telling us, okay, watch out. Volume on Binance's BTCUSDT uh trading pair is still well below average. The 30-day moving average continues to decline. There's no demand for BTC. Even though it might feel like it, there isn't. We should really be seeing volume pumping and spiking if there really is demand. onbalance volume continues to point down bearishly. So, while we did have a good chance of Bitcoin pushing up one more time to 102K or something like that, we're really at a dangerous point. And it's not just Bitcoin either. Like I said before, Ethereum as well, actually, I can just hide all this stuff, is also doing the same thing, if not in worse shape. If you've been watching my analysis and following, and I've been posting this stuff as well in the um in the Discord server for Coin Bureau, I was looking at 3435 as being the next pivot high. Last Wednesday, the 14th, we saw a push up here kind of towards this level, but it didn't quite reach it. Then it got rejected. Monday and Tuesday's crash for Ethereum saw it close below short-term support. While this isn't a uh bare flag, it did lose support. And you'll notice that both of these days, it struggled to push and close above. Yesterday, it actually looks even worse. Today, it's still bad. So, the reality is that support has been broken here. And what happens next is a test of previously broken support, which confirms his resistance, and it goes lower. Now, I didn't talk about my targets for BTC. I want to talk about what I'm expecting to happen next for Bitcoin and Ethereum. And I still have three more charts I really need to share with you. But before I do, I need you to check out the description down below. There are great exchange partners, whether it's WEX, BYDI, or TUIT that you've got to sign up with. They all have different kickbacks and rewards for trading on the exchanges, for generating volume, even for just depositing money and holding it on the exchanges. And with two bit you can actually use this with the all trading trading platform which I use for all of my trades. It's fantastic. There are plus sorry plus there are plus there are more deals that are available on the coinbureau website. If you go to the coinbureau.com website and click on deals the first thing to check out is the coin bureau club. I mentioned this before that I am sharing some updates on this as well about four days a week, but Dan, my co-host on this channel as well as Guy and Nick on the main channel, they're more active on that server. So, if you have questions, you want to talk to them directly, this is the best way to do it. There are other exchanges, other tools to check out."

Plus, there is a 10% discount for our course, the better traders, 15 minutes to financial freedom, which teaches you how to trade in a bare market without leverage, and with the goal of reducing the time you spend in front of the screen trading to just 15 minutes a day max. Okay, now let me talk about the price targets first before I talk about the other two charts. I think that's important. So, in order to do that, we're actually going to go with Bitcoin first. And I want to go to the weekly time frame because this will be the clearest because we want to have a zoomed out view of everything that's happening right now. The name of the game right now is called artificial supports. We have artificial supports littered on BTC's weekly chart starting at 80,000 and then here at about 75,000 and then here at about 49,000 or 50,000. Now, it's interesting to note that these are relatively around some round numbers 80K, 75K, 49K, or 50K. The reason why these are so important to identify is because we've already done this before. Every single bare market, everyone's looking at these lower prices as must hold levels. And when these must hold levels don't hold, the market drops dramatically lower, going to the next one, going to the next one, going to the next one, going to the next one, going lower and lower. I still believe that Bitcoin is going to be heading probably down to about $35,000 by October of this year. I know that might seem extreme, but this isn't my first rodeo. Okay. I also need to go back to 2022 to prove to you why I think this concept of sequentially um lower well extreme lows or rather this idea of artificial supports is so important. So looking at 2022 as the price started to fall down okay we even had some short-term support levels that got broken but then we had a pivot low here in January. Oh, thank God we had some sort of bounce. And there's also this mustold level. We saw this level of around 30k hold so well back in the bare market summer of 2021. There's no way it's going to be lost again, right? And even as we see a little dip right here. Oh, cool. Look, we have a higher low. Things are okay. Things are not going to go any lower than this. And the problem is that as soon as these levels are tested, they are hit hard. In one week, we literally went down two levels to make a new low, creating a fake artificial support level, which was easily crushed a couple of weeks later, and it shot lower and lower till we had another low here at 17K, which everyone thought, no, it it it has to hold based off of the previous all-time high, right? This level up here, sorry, at 19,000 something or other. This level has to hold, right? like this. This is a valid level to to watch. And what happened? No, the price got cracked and it pierced and went even lower. We actually did it again. We're going to have so many artificial support levels as we go lower. And the same thing happened back in 2018 to 2019. Okay? In the same way that we have artificial resistance levels, all of these levels, previous pivot highs, gave us targets for going up higher and higher. And all these levels were taken out. Boom. Boom. On really big moves. It works both ways. Okay. So, those levels 80K, 75K, 50K down here, 38K are very much valid in my book. So, what about Ethereum? Is Ethereum any different? No."

No. Ethereum is if not the exact same, it's almost worse because the problem with Ethereum is that I think that it's going to be going down back to about $1,000. And we have all of these really weak levels of artificial support that everyone's going to be looking at. Oh, $2,100 has to hold cuz this was such a great pivot level so many times. Yeah, right. You'll see. You'll see. And then we have another artificial low here at 1385. We have another low here at 1077. So again, I'm trying to identify these big fat pivot lows to see will these be good targets. So again, we're looking at 2623, 2,11, 1385, 1,73, and 8.81. Yes, it could even go that low. Why? Well, if I'm expecting Bitcoin from its top going down about 72% down to 35K, we should expect Ethereum to do more than a 72% draw down. So, if we're looking at more than a 72% draw down for Ethereum, picking this high over here, then we should be looking at like a 78, maybe even 80% draw down. That would bring us down to about $1,000. I think that that's a valid target. If you look at the pullback over here from its top in November 2021 down to its low, it dropped 81%. So, seeing Ethereum falling down possibly here to $1,000 to 78%. I could totally see this happening. And the thing that makes this harder to swallow is that Ethereum didn't make a real significant new all-time high at all. And it won't. It's done. Volume is spoken. It's done. It's fallen off a literal cliff. There's no interest. There's no excitement. Just like back over here in December 2021. We will see spikes as we go lower, but there's not going to be another new rally for a long time. I'm sorry if you got the memo late. Okay. Now, things that could change around maybe the Clarity Act, but honestly, that also got kicked down the road if you didn't pay attention to the other videos that are shared here on the channel, especially by Dan talking about that a lot. No, it's not that's not anything to pay attention to at all. The other thing you have to keep in mind is stable coin dominance. it broke a very critical level of resistance because it pushed above this level of resistance. There is a much greater chance of this pushing up a lot higher. Not to mention that the macro trend for this chart is bullish. But Aaron, how can this chart be bullish and you're bearish? Well, when stable coin dominance is bullish like it's been ever since back over here. Remember when that we had that big crash on October the 10th, we saw stable coin dominance rocket up 26%? That was the beginning of the end. And this massive uptrend started after that fact. And ever since then, the macro trend has been curling up more and more. The higher this goes, the more pain that is in store for us. And I still believe that we have more pain on the upside. Think that we're going to see stable coin dominance probably go up to like 18%, maybe even 20%. A lot higher because we're going into a bare market. Now, is Bitcoin or should we consider Bitcoin a flight to safety like gold? No, we shouldn't. Has has Bitcoin performed this way all year? No, it hasn't. Gold has had an insane year already up 14%. This is gold. This is gold. Okay, you you have to understand that gold will continue to pump because gold is seen as a flight to safety. Am I a crypto guy? Absolutely. Do I like trading crypto? Oh, yes, I do. Do I like and do I hold Bitcoin? Yes. Do I enjoy trading crypto?"

Oh, yes, I do. Do I like and do I hold Bitcoin? Yes. Do I enjoy trading crypto? Oh, yes. But why would I deny a massive bullish uptrend for gold, which is on the verge, by the way, of going above $5,000. I actually think it's going to go a lot higher, too. Same thing with silver. Now, do both of these charts going up higher and higher buy um good tidings for the world? No. We know that gold pumping up higher is a bad sign. We know that silver pumping up higher is a bad sign. It's a sign that instability and the pendulum of finance in the world is swinging really hard towards precious metals right now. And it's not just gold and silver. It's also platinum. It's copper. It's all this stuff. There's a big shift that's happening. Understand that blowoff tops can be extremely devastating. Also understand that as long as gold is going up higher, all eyes are on gold. For everyone that thinks that because gold is pumping and as soon as it has a blowoff top, that money is going to flow magically into Bitcoin, I recommend you get your medication checked. Just just have another follow-up appointment. Okay? Why oh why would precious metals investors decide, you know what, I made so much money with gold, I can't wait to buy a falling asset like Bitcoin. That that doesn't make any sense to me. In fact, when we look at charts like the S&P, which I wasn't planning on showing, but we do need to keep that in mind as well. There are some really negative signs that are flashing here that mean to me that we could see a pretty nasty rollover or a bare market for the S&P. And keep in mind if the S&P does go into a bare market, do you know what will go up higher? Gold. Do you know what will go lower? Bitcoin and crypto. I believe that the S&P that the US stock market will be going into a bare market this year. I also believe that Bitcoin will be going a lot lower as well as alts are going a lot farther and I think that gold will still do well. However, there will be an inflection point for gold because as soon as the market starts to kind of teeter out, gold will have a blowoff top and it will be very painful and very devastating and it will hurt a lot of people and it will go a lot lower and all of a sudden people are going to go, \"Wait, what happened? I just went 100x long or thousandx long on these positions for precious metals and now they're dumping. But trust me, when we see more instability in the stock market and look what happened this week alone, this is the weekly candle. There was a lot of instability in the stock market. What happened for gold? It moved up 7.8%. What about silver? It moved up 9%. These are still going. They're very, very strong bullish. Will they have a devastating parabolic blowoff top? Yes. But will Bitcoin go up higher if the stock market goes down? No, not at all. And I'm not trying to be a jerk. I'm just trying to be realistic. Okay. So, to wrap everything up with a very pretty bow, there is a chance that Bitcoin could turn around. It has to close above support. And even if that happens, if we get some sort of magical mystery tour where it happens to go all the way up here, maybe even to $103,000, I still expect it to turn around and that we're going to be going lower. This is not the outcome I am expecting."

I personally think that Bitcoin's going to be rejected here and it's going to start falling lower, which means that alts, not all, but most, will see a lot more downside from here on out. So, how are you prepared for this? I spent a lot of time trying to gently remind you that this is a bottom year, as in we are heading to the bottom this year. You need to understand that there's nothing wrong with staying in crypto. You can actually do very well shorting alts, but you need to have the right trading strategies in mind and you need to have the right mentality as well as knowing what coins you want to buy at the bottom and how much of your portfolio you're going to put to those things. I made some videos about this. I made one actually on the more coin bureau channel, which isn't this channel, but I want you to watch that video cuz it's going to give you some ideas about how I find coins that could be really, really profitable to buy at the bottom of this bull market, expecting them to go a lot higher in the years to come. That's the mentality you should be having right now. Watch that. And until the next time, you know what to do. Stay awesome and stay in the green. Peace."
