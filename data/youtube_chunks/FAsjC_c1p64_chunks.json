Trump's tariff turmoil. The Supreme Court is weighing up whether to \ncancel the import tariffs slapped on a whole   load of nations last year. What might happen \nand what would the outcome mean for the markets? Zcash Civil War, one of last year's \nbest performing crypto projects,   just saw its dev team resign on mass as the \ncrypto space sees its first major drama of   the year. And we'll have Lewis with the TA, \nthe winner of our portfolio competition,   tweets of the week, and much more besides. This is the Coin Bureau News Live. Yes. Hello everyone. Welcome to another episode \nof the Coin Bureau live news show. It is great to   see you all. My name is Guy and I am joined \nas Lewis. Yes. Yes. Yes. Nice to see you,   sir. How you doing? Um I'm doing good. I'm \nfilling in for for Nick right now. I figured   we could make it uh a family affair as one of the \ncomments has eloquently pointed out with Guy and   uh Guy Jr. over here. Yes. A few people have \nmentioned that Lewis looks like my son. So,   we're make Yeah, we're making this a family \naffair. Father and son. Here we go. Um, yes,   as you can see, Lewis is making his live debut \non the show today. Now, um, I have I sadly have   to report to you folks that poor Nick is not well \ntoday. Um, I I I I hope he won't mind me sharing,   but he had some dodgy shellfish over the weekend \nand is the sick man of uh of Dubai at the moment. Um, I think we actually have some live footage \nof him in bed. Yes, there we are surrounded by   uh by the scene of the crime. Yes, poor \nold Nick is not feeling very well. So,   um, you will just have to make do with myself and \nLewis, I'm afraid. We will do our best to shepherd   you through in Nick's absence. Um, but before \nwe get stuck in, can I please implore you all to   smash that like button for Nick, folks? For Nick. I'm not going to promise you some portfolio alpha   or anything like that. All I'm going to say is if \nthat like status bar below Lewis doesn't get to   100%. Then poor old Nick isn't going to recover \nin time for next week's stream. So hammer those   likes for Nick, please. 100%. Yeah. Poor old Nick. We need 100,000. We Exactly. likes. And we need   100,000 likes for Nick. Have you ever had food \npoisoning, Louis? Um yes. A long time ago. It is   not pleasant, is it? Not at all. Okay. Wishing him \nthe best. Um, and of course uh you you guys can   watching can all uh com drop a comment as well. Maybe I'm sure Nick if he's not he he might not   be watching this live because I think he really \nis under the weather, but he'll probably watch   it on catchup and I'm sure he would appreciate \nsome uh some supportive comments uh in the uh   in the uh in down below. Um he's not hung over. I can tell you that much. I can tell you Nick   is Nick does not do hangovers. Um, so, uh, yeah, \nplease do leave a supportive message for Nick and   pound that like button so as he recovers and is \nback for next week's stream. So, Lewis, you and I   are just going to have to soldier on through. Yep. Well, you know, you're the expert out here and uh,   this is my first time, so I'll let you lead and \nuh, I'll just chime in. Okay. Okay, cool. Well,   let's take a look then. Uh, we'll go back \nto last week's price action for Bitcoin. Um,   so if we go back to last Monday before Nick even \nconsidered eating a dodgy oyster, um, we can uh,   we remember that Michael Sailor went ahead and \nmade his first Bitcoin purchase of the year. Um,   just over 1,000 uh, BTC he added there to \nStrategy's increasingly swelling pile. Um,   we also had some strong ETF flows, right? Yeah."

Um, just over 1,000 uh, BTC he added there to Strategy's increasingly swelling pile. Um, we also had some strong ETF flows, right? Yeah. in the beginning of the week uh or the beginning   of the year very strong and we saw that in the \nprice uh you know crypto was looking pretty good   in the beginning of 2026 pretty pretty good yes \nbitcoin actually uh actually went up to 94k now   I have to ask you were you were you starting \nto believe at 94k um I was not uh a couple   friends were a couple acquaintances people \nwho uh reached out to me and I I told them,   \"Guys, I don't I don't think you should jump \non it quite yet.\" Okay. Feel like you should   wait just a little bit longer. So, they'll be \nthey'll be thanking you for that. Um eventually,   maybe. Who knows? Okay. Okay. Yes. Uh 94K was uh \nwas tested. Um but as we'll soon see, it didn't it   didn't last. Um meanwhile, on Tuesday, um we had \nLuxembourg's finance minister making some bullish   comments about Bitcoin. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty good. Um, you know, it didn't work out too well with   uh America's government, you know, basically \npromoting crypto and saying it's going to be the   best thing in the world and the new financial \ninstruments. But, uh, maybe Luxembourg's um,   maybe maybe that'll turn things around and we'll \nhave a different scenario and and things will just   be up from here. Exactly. Maybe maybe this is the \nLuxembourg put we're entering now. Um, meanwhile,   uh, our old favorite Tom Lee was back out \nagain, wheeled out onto, I think this was CNBC,   um, calling for a quarter of a million dollar \nBitcoin. I can't remember what exactly his Oh,   oh, for 2026. Okay, so Tommy is bullish as ever. Um, and Sailor himself actually caught a bit   of a break here. Now, this was some good news \nwhich we should talk about a little bit because   uh as you may recall um MSCI was weighing \nup the uh the possibility of um removing   uh not only strategy but digital asset treasury \ncompanies in general. Very scary. Yeah. From its   from its indices. And what this would have meant \nif MCI had removed strategy then uh all these   passive funds that buy you know any indices that \nstrategy had featured in would automatically sell. This would not be not have been nice. That would \nhave absolutely destroyed the entire market. Yeah. So, this is very good news actually. We actually \nYeah, we we got a bit of a reprieve on Tuesday   which I don't we probably weren't grateful enough \nfor. Um we really got let off the hook. Yeah,   I mean this this would have damaged the markets \nincredibly. I was I was very worried about it   after I did the video and um it's I'm very happy \nto see that this decision is what happened. Things   to be thankful for. Um Bitcoin didn't seem to get \nthe memo though. It fell uh back below 92K. It   didn't care. Honeybadger didn't care. Um and then \nfell below 91K. Yeah, it just keeps on falling for   some reason. Yeah, this is uh despite progress \nbeing made on the Clarity Act as well. Um,   now we're going to talk about this in a little \nmore detail a little later on. Um, but, uh, yeah,   the Clarity Act, this big market structure bill, \num, that is making its way through Congress. Uh,   and as you'll soon see, the time is maybe a little \nbit against it, but we'll we'll get to that. Um,   miners are also dumping Bitcoin, right? Yeah, \nthey're dumping. And, uh, because they're dumping,   the mining difficulty of Bitcoin is falling as \nwell. Yeah. So uh yeah, historically when Bitcoin   mining difficulty falls, uh it tends to fall along \nwith price as well. The two are the two are pretty   closely correlated. Um now this is a result of \nbecause Bitcoin's price has been falling."

And, uh, because they're dumping, the mining difficulty of Bitcoin is falling as well. Yeah. So uh yeah, historically when Bitcoin mining difficulty falls, uh it tends to fall along with price as well. The two are the two are pretty closely correlated. Um now this is a result of because Bitcoin's price has been falling. Um a   lot of miners are being squeezed out. So they are \nswitching off their machines, powering down their   AS6, which means fewer miners on the network, \nwhich means the difficulty goes down in order   to incentivize more miners to then join. That is \nthe beauty of the mathematics of Bitcoin. Yeah,   one of the uh one of the really clever ways in \nwhich the whole network is structured. But yes,   at the moment, difficulty is falling along with \nprice as well. It's basically it's it's not a good   time to be a minor. So, uh as you saw from that \nheadline there, I think that was Riot Platforms   uh selling a fair bit then. Um now, uh we flagged \nthis up last week as well. We had quite a lot of   employment data um that we were looking at. Um \nwe had some employment numbers come in below   expectations. Yeah. Um you know they added a lot \n41,000 but not as much as what people wanted or   expected. Yeah. And um we saw that a little bit \nreflected in the price dumping below you know   92 and then 91 and then 90. Yeah. This was on \nThursday. Now Lewis as you're sitting in that   chair you have to point out um something that got \nclosed because of this uh because of this. Yeah. Um, I I wish I had some some weights to lift to \nget a good pump in. Do you want to try your best   South African accent? My South African accent \nclosed the gap as per usual and it was okay. I'm not going to I'm not even going to bother with \nthat anymore. I thought I had it, but guess not. So, we closes the gap. Close the gap. Why do I \nfeel like that could be a meme? Is that a meme? Yeah, it should be. It's like over the line. Over \nthe line. Close the gap. the hole. Um, yeah. So,   yeah, we did uh we did we did close that CME gap \nright there, but as you can see, there's another   one below it at around 88K. So, we might still go \nlower to close that CME gap there, Nick, I think,   is probably just They do tend to close. I don't \nknow what the hell I'm talking about. All right,   I'm do tend to close them CME gaps, don't \nthey? What am I doing? Okay, Friday. Uh,   yes. Friday. Friday. Friday. Uh Friday we had NFP \nuh non-farm payroll numbers come in uh slightly   below expectations actually. Um the market still \ndumped. Yeah. What a surprise. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It just did not crypto does not seem to be able to \ncatch a bit at the moment and uh that took us into   the weekend. Then on the weekend, on the weekend, \num you know, in the beginning of of the year,   like we talked about, we we saw some nice inflows \nwith the ETFs, but apparently um that just didn't   want to last because now we had four straight days \nof outflows on the Bitcoin ETF. Um ETH is on its   third day, so not quite as bad as uh Bitcoin, but \nit's still pretty telling that a lot of people and   a lot of institutions are moving out of Bitcoin \nstill right now. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so, uh, so yes,   outflows, as as Lewis said, outflows for Bitcoin \nand ETH as well. Now, we have to talk, we didn't   mention this at the, uh, at the top of the show, \nbut there's been a sort of a drama going on um,   over the last few hours involving this man, uh, \none of crypto's reluctant main characters, I think   you can say, obviously, uh, Jerome Pal, chair \nof the Federal Reserve."

Um, so, uh, so yes, outflows, as as Lewis said, outflows for Bitcoin and ETH as well. Now, we have to talk, we didn't mention this at the, uh, at the top of the show, but there's been a sort of a drama going on um, over the last few hours involving this man, uh, one of crypto's reluctant main characters, I think you can say, obviously, uh, Jerome Pal, chair of the Federal Reserve. Um, so the TLDDR here is   that basically he released this video, I think it \nwas yesterday, uh, basically sort of pushing back   against the fact that, uh, prosecutors have \nlaunched a criminal investigation into him,   uh, regarding the renovation of the Fed's \nheadquarters. Yeah, pretty wild. I'm not   I'm not sure if that's ever happened before. um \nyou know they say that well he said he said that   the threat of criminal charges is a consequence \nof the Federal Reserve setting interest rates   based on our best assessment of what will serve \nthe public rather than following the preferences   of the president. So they're saying like okay \nthe president doesn't like what he's doing so   he's you know putting charges against him. Um, \nand some people do like what he's doing. Some,   but a lot of people actually don't. Yeah. But \nin the end, the markets, well, not crypto,   but the general markets are still going up. So, it \nseems like Powell is able to do what he wants to   do. And and the markets are still going up, which \nshould make Trump happy, but you know, I guess   Trump's not happy enough because they're not high \nup. He is not happy enough. Yeah. This is now this   is a kind of extraordinary thing we're seeing here \nat the moment because this is all this is calling   into question the independence of the Federal \nReserve and as Lewis said you know quoting that   thing that Powell said you know he's basically \nsaying that these charges are being implemented   because uh he and presumably the rest of the FOMC \nbut I think this is very much directed at Powell   himself are basically not doing what Trump wants. They are not lowering interest rates as quickly   and as low as as Trump would like. Um and as such, \nyou know, this is why these criminal charges are   being pressed. It's not, you know, as far as \nPowell is concerned, this has got nothing to   do with the the the renovation of the Fed HQ. It \nis a kind of extraordinary moment. And you know,   obviously there's there's quite a lot of sort \nof general chaos going on around Trump and what   the US is doing at the moment. And this is just \nanother piece of that puzzle. But it is really   big news because uh yeah, as we say, this is this \ncalls into question Fed independence. And as a   result actually uh Lewis mentioned it pumping the \nmarkets. Um this uncertainty because this is what   it is really. This is uncertainty that is being \nintroduced here. This has been great for the gold   bugs um and also for silver as well. Both gold and \nsilver have hit new all-time highs lately. Um so   we are in a very very interesting period folks not \nonly geopolitically but also uh what is going on   with the Fed and I think this is and Jerome Pal \nand I think this is going to be a big story of   this week. So, uh, we'll be keeping a very close \neye on that and we'll have more to bring you,   uh, on that next week, but, uh, watch this one \ncarefully. It's going to be interesting.

Looks like Nick has had a little pullback today   on the daily. Nevertheless, it surely lead to a \nweekly consolidation and eventually Nick will be   back with us soon. Inshallah. Inshallah. We hope \nNick will be back with us soon. Poor Yeah. Um I   wouldn't say Nick is necessarily feeling bearish. Um I'd say he's feeling a lot worse than that. Um   yes, poor old Nick. Um okay. Uh so yes, lovely to \nsee all your messages of support uh for Nick as   well. Um also uh messages of support for Jerome \nPowell. Powell is a honeybger. He don't give   two poops. Good for Pal. This is uh Yeah, this is \ngonna be uh He really doesn't. He really doesn't. I mean, he's getting on a bit, isn't he? He's He's \nHe's proved himself. I bet he's just like, \"What? Bring it on. I don't care. I'm too I'm too goddamn \nold, pretty much.\" Um uh Nick looks a little   different today. Do you think I lost some weight? He did lose some weight. He lost some muscle mass. Lost some muscle mass. Lost some hair. Had a bit \nof a trim, but otherwise, he's the same he's the   same Nick that we know and love. Okay. All right. Uh let's move on. And we were we touched on the   idea of tariffs, right? Yeah. Yeah, we touched \non and we talked about it on our new Friday show,   the uh FUD and FOMO show, which by the way, if \nuh you aren't if you're watching this right now,   you don't know about it, it's a new show. You \nshould check it out every Friday. It's really   great. It's more laidback than than this. And \nwe've talked about a lot of different things,   including the tariff decision, which should have \nhappened on Friday, or we were expecting it,   but uh then it didn't. It was a big old nothing \nburger. Here we are. We were all keyed up. We were   watching things coming out of the Supreme Court \nand then they uh they postponed it till the 14th,   which is wedded. Yeah. Or I actually read uh \nthe article and it said they expect it to be   on the 14th. So Okay. You know, maybe the 14th, \nmaybe the 15th, maybe the 31st or whatever. We'll   figure it out. Yeah. So, if you're not up to \nspeed with this, folks, this is this is kind   of important at the moment. You will all remember \nTrump's tariffs from last year and all the uh the   chaos uh and confusion that they caused. Well, \nyou thought they might have gone away, but no,   they are back because uh the legitimacy of the \ntariffs has been challenged and uh this has gone   all the way to the Supreme Court and the uh the \ncourt is we're basically waiting on the court's   ruling on whether these tariffs were legal or not."

Um and it if uh if prediction markets uh are your   thing then right now uh the odds that they will \nrule in uh Trump's favor it's it's pretty it's   pretty low 31%. Yeah. Now we should explain what \nexactly the possible outcomes are here because   this is this is not a binary outcome. This is not \none thing or another. There are a few different   options. But let's let's quickly look at the two \nextremes. So on the one hand um the Supreme Court   they could say they could kind of uh say what \nTrump is basically hoping they're going to say and   uh that all the tariffs are legal and that \nTrump can just go ahead uh instituting them   uh carry on Mr. President. So that is one possible \noutcome. What's the other kind of extreme outcome? Well I would have to think that they would say \nthat they're all illegal. Okay. And then uh they   would just order the Treasury to pay back you \nknow everything that that has been paid and that   seems a little extreme to me to be honest but \nit is one of the extremes. Yeah. So these are   the extreme options. Either they say you're all \ngood carry on or they say no these are bad and you   got to pay them back. Now quite a lot of money \nuh as we'll see in a moment has been collected   uh via these tariffs but as I said it's not just \na binary one. There are a couple of middle-of the   road options. Well, and the first um is that they \nthat the court could rule um that the tariffs can   be used under international emergency economic \npowers act. That's the EA as I'm sure you know. I'm talking to the converted here, but only \nfor narrow national security threats and not   for general trade deficits. So this could mean um \nthat uh certain tariffs would be struck down like   the global tariffs, you know, the ones leveled on \nparticular countries. Um but uh specific ones like   the fentinel related ones could be left intact. So that's one kind of middle- of the road option. There's another middle of the road option as well, \nright? Yes. The other middle of the road is to say   that they are illegal, but they're starting to \nbe illegal from today or whenever the decision   is finalized. And if they do that, then the \ngovernment won't have to pay back the $150   billion that, you know, they collected. So that's \na more of a middle ground. Yeah. Okay. So yes,   as Lewis says, $150 billion have been uh collected \nthrough these tariffs so far. And yeah, I mean,   there is a possibility uh that the Supreme \nCourt will say the government has to pay all   that back. What do you think the market's going \nto going to react to that? Well, I think it's   going to be fairly interesting. I think equities \num are going to uh are going to react pretty well   because if you consider companies like Costco, \nWalmart, uh Target, you know, these big importers,   there they are um on their away day to Washington, \num they have been eating these enormously,   you know, much higher import costs and either \npassing them on to consumers or or you know,   concealing them in their balance sheet. But um the \nthese guys if the tariffs were in fact struck down   um would see a massive boost in their margins \nand you can you would imagine that their   uh their share prices would would rocket. Yeah. I mean pretty much anything that's that relies   on the global supply chains uh could probably \nbenefit or would benefit from reduced friction,   reduced cost of of the tariffs if they're, you \nknow, no longer there. Yeah."

I mean pretty much anything that's that relies on the global supply chains uh could probably benefit or would benefit from reduced friction, reduced cost of of the tariffs if they're, you know, no longer there. Yeah. So, a lot of a lot   of different things, a lot of companies would \nend up going up. All of those, you know, Costco,   Walmart, Target, even Apple, Nvidia, pretty much \npretty much everything to be honest. Anything,   as Lewis says, anything that's kind of been \num, you know, relies on global supply chains,   um, you know, especially to and from China, etc. So, yeah, I think certainly for equity markets,   uh, the tariffs being struck down would probably \nsignal good news. um it wouldn't be good news for   the government obviously having to repay that \nmoney but also from the point of view of bond   yields. Now, you would imagine that a country \nthat is, I think, somewhere in the region of $   38 trillion in debt doesn't really want to see \na spike in bond yields, but that is probably   what would that what they would get um if these if \nthese tariffs were struck down to say nothing of   just sort of general questions about US fiscal \nsustainability and how these refunds might go   because I don't imagine this is this is this would \nbe a particularly easy process. Yeah, definitely   not. Yeah. Um and of course, uh what we can almost \nbe certain of is that if uh the Supreme Court does   rule against Trump and say that, you know, these \ntariffs are illegal and have to be repaid or or   something that Trump doesn't like, then you \ncan imagine um there will be an appeal and uh   this this will probably rumble on. Um safe havens \nsuch as gold and silver, which as we pointed out   earlier have been uh doing pretty well recently, \nthey might see a bit of a correction if the Trumps   if the Trumps the tariffs go down and sort of this \nwhole kind of global trade war tension cools. Um,   so that might be uh, you know, that might be a \nbit of a headwind for for the likes of gold and   silver. But what about crypto? Yeah. People want \nto know how crypto react. Well, you know, it's   like it's like what happened when we got some good \nnews? What happened in in the crypto space? Uh,   basically basically we went down. Um, and then \nwhat happened when we got some bad news? Well,   basically we went down again. So, I would have \nto think that whether um anything happens, we're   going to end up going down. Okay. Okay. I must \nsay I kind of agree on this because yeah, if um if   it's bad news, then uh crypto could well sell off. You know, especially if this news comes outside   of regular market hours, then obviously crypto \ntrades 24/7. It's often the first thing to get   sold. Um we've seen this happen many times before. I also think yeah if it's good news then a lot of   people they've already been doing this could \nswitch from crypto to like these companies in   the stock market that have that actual reasoning \nto go up also. So that could also hurt crypto in   that regard. Yeah. Yeah. I uh I must say I hope \nI hope we're wrong on this one, but I kind of   think this tariffs news is is probably something \ncrypto wants to forget as soon as possible. Well,   you know, it feels like it's been like a year. I know it's been a little bit less than a year,   but it feels like it's been so long that event \nlike I don't know. I think a lot of people are   already sort of over it and they're not paying \nas much attention to it anyway. So maybe it's   not going to affect it as much. I that's that's \nstrange, isn't it?"

Well, you know, it feels like it's been like a year. I know it's been a little bit less than a year, but it feels like it's been so long that event like I don't know. I think a lot of people are already sort of over it and they're not paying as much attention to it anyway. So maybe it's not going to affect it as much. I that's that's strange, isn't it? Because there's there's really   nothing else happening in the world at the moment \nthat might be distracting people's attention from   things like boring old tariffs and stuff like \nthat. You know, there's it's not like there's any   geopolitical chaos going on or anything that we \nshould, you know, probably be paying attention to. Um, so yeah, I mean these tariffs I think are just \ngoing to be the gift that keeps on giving. A bit   like uh a bit like malaria. Um, okay. So, uh, now \nif you're feeling anxious about these tariffs and   the state of the market, then, uh, you could \ndo a lot worse than just hodddling your crypto   and waiting for all of this to blow over. And if \nthat is what you are planning to do, then there is   no better wallet to use than Tangum. Now, Tangum \ncombines uh the safety of a hardware device with   the convenience of a web wallet as well. Um they \nare absurdly easy to set up and use. Wonderful   little devices. And uh you can get a 10% discount \nif you scan the QR code. Lewis. Oh well, you know   what? I know what else uh I know what QR code I'm \nabout to scan. Yeah. Don't don't don't waste the   time talking to me. Sorry. I got to go. I've got \nsome QR codes to scan. Yes. scan the QR code uh   for that discount or the link in the description \nif you insist. Okay. Now, uh Lewis, there was   another slight drama last week in the cryptoverse. Yeah. And this one was actually pretty interesting   to me, especially considering, you know, I was I \nhad some positions in here and I think Nick did   as well. And we're talking about Zcash. Okay. And \nuh the Zcash crash. Apparently, the team resigned   um or a lot of the team resigned. Uh, and the \nstory goes, CEO Josh Sweheart announced on January   7th that the entire Electric Coin Company ECC team \nresigned following a constructive discharge by the   Bootstrap Board. Yeah. So, a little bit of context \nhere in case you're not up to date with this. Electric Coin Company ECC is the entity that, you \nknow, sort of develops uh Zcash. It was the entity   that employed Zcash's developers. And Bootstrap \nis a kind of nonprofit entity that was sort of   attached to Electriccoin Company um and you know \nsort of oversaw oversaw um network support and   and what have you. Um so there was a disagreement \nbetween Bootstrap and uh um Zcash's developers. It's funny how that happened now after, you know, \nlike late last year the price went up so so so   much and there were all of these really really \nbig people talking about it and like getting   involved and and buying and I'm sure they had \nsome, you know, influence and wanted to take it   into a certain direction. Yeah. And um I read one \nof Josh's tweets and he was saying how he really   wanted to just stay with the with the original \nlike ethos of of Zcash and privacy. And so I   so I commend him, you know, for for doing that \ncuz I'm sure there was some deals where he could   have got godly amounts of money and uh he decided \nto say like look, no, we're sticking with what we   believe in. And so if he has another project, I \ndon't know. I'd be interested in looking at it. Um, but then there's also what happened with \nuh Monero at the same time as Zcash went down,   Monero ended up going up. So maybe something's \nhappening happening with that. We'll see. Yeah,   I think what it shows is that the uh the privacy \nnarrative is very much alive and well at the   moment."

Yeah, I think what it shows is that the uh the privacy narrative is very much alive and well at the moment. Um, so yeah, there were these I think \nthat what they called irreconcilable differences   um between board members uh over the strategic um \ndirection of Zcash. So basically the developers I   think the word the phrase I saw was rage quit. They basically rage quit from electric coin   company and then promptly went and started a new \nentity um to continue their mission of building   what they call unstoppable private money. Um and \nyeah well the impact of this was pretty clear in   the charts. Uh Ze uh tanked on this news as you \nwould as you would kind of expect. Um but um it   did it did start to recover pretty quickly. It \ndid. It did. And as a trader, I I look at the   charts and you could tell a lot with just the \nprice action on the charts. And the fact that   the entire team essentially resigned and it didn't \njust go straight to zero tells you a lot. It tells   you that this is very resilient. And there's \ndefinitely something behind the scenes here,   which gives me some hope for ZEC because um I \nmean, how many other coins could could have half   their team or most of the team just resign and \nand not just go to zero, you know? Uh this Yeah,   it fell. It fell, but it it had a nice bounce \nand it seems to be stabilizing right now. So,   it's looking pretty good to be honest. Yeah. Well, \nlet's see what happens with Zcash. Obviously,   yeah, as as Lewis says, if if a project can \nsurvive its whole dev team basically walking   out and and then, you know, promptly start to \nrebound, um there must be quite a lot to it, quite   a lot more to it than uh than perhaps meets the \neye. So, yeah, it does look uh it does look kind   of positive for Zcash at the moment. And uh you \nknow, if you've looked at trending coins uh today,   you'll see that Zcash is amongst them, Monero, and \nindeed a number of other privacy projects as well. And I think um I think it was last week's stream \nthat Nick and I were kind of discussing this as   well. Privacy is almost certainly going to be a \nbig narrative of 2026. And I mean I was a little   surprised. I didn't necessarily think that uh we \nwould see big pumps for the likes of XMR and Zcash   because I sort of thought well we're more likely \nto see you know big gains for kind of more sort   of corporate oriented crypto projects because \nobviously I think a lot of the a lot of the   privacy narrative a lot of the drive behind the \nuh privacy narrative is coming from institutions   they're the ones who really want it. Um, that \nbrings me back to the point. Weren't there are a   lot of institutions or companies that were getting \ninto Zcash uh lately and that's probably where the   riff happened because they had to make a decision, \nyou know. Yeah. But um yeah, there was there was   quite a lot of support for the Zcash devs who uh \nwho walked out. I think um the Winkle Voss twins   among others voiced their support. So yeah, I \nI support them. Yeah. So, uh, it looks like,   um, Zcash is, uh, down, but certainly not out. Um, \nso, uh, yeah, I think this, this is definitely one   to watch as the, uh, as the privacy narrative \nunfolds over the rest of the year. Okay. Now,   we are going to get some wonderful TA in a minute, \nbut first of all, Lewis, I need to tell you about   BitGet. Okay, I need to give a big thanks uh to \nBitGet, another of our brand partners. They've   helped us run a portfolio competition, as you've \nnoticed, over the last uh, few weeks."

Now, we are going to get some wonderful TA in a minute, but first of all, Lewis, I need to tell you about BitGet. Okay, I need to give a big thanks uh to BitGet, another of our brand partners. They've helped us run a portfolio competition, as you've noticed, over the last uh, few weeks. Uh we   brought that to an end last week. Um and uh I'm \nvery pleased to announce um that our winner Colin   uh has been selected. So Colin um yes, we're \nkeeping keeping you anonymous. Other than that,   um you will be receiving uh that uh the balance \nof that portfolio very very soon. So look out   for the rest of you. Yes, congratulations, Colin. For the rest of you, if you don't already have a   BitGet account, then you are missing out. You can \nsign up now um and be eligible for up to 50k USDT   in bonus. Again, QR code Lewis. There it is. Get \nscanning. One second. Get SC. You've already got   one. I've already got one. Okay. So, they did \npretty well with that competition, right? Like   they started with five 5K. We started We started \nwith 5K. We started with $5,000 USDT and uh we   basically every week uh the our loyal viewers \ngot to decide where we would allocate this to and   what sort of percentage of the portfolio. For the \nlast few weeks they just insisted that we full the   whole lot into Bitcoin. I mean it's it would been \npretty smart because I think uh you put full port   into anything else. We would have been in a lot of \ntrouble. Um but yeah, we were we uh weren't quite   at 5k when we closed out the competition, but \nnot far below it. Um and hey, in crypto in this   market, that's good. That is pretty good. So, well \ndone to all our viewers who who held our hand and   shepherded us through that portfolio competition. Great work. Okay, it is that point in the show   where we go to Lewis for some excellent TA. How \nare you going to manage this one, Louis? Um well,   I actually built a time machine. Okay. So, that's \nwhat you've been doing all afternoon. That is what   I've been doing this afternoon. So, I'm going to \nI'm going to hop into the time machine and then   I'll I'll throw myself on the screen, do the TA, \nand then I'll jump back. Okay. Do it. Let's see. All right. Thanks for the handoff, Lewis. Uh, I \nthink I'll take it from here. In all seriousness   though, um, not much has changed and I don't think \na lot will change when it comes to my analysis   until something crazy happens. And that's because \nif you look at Bitcoin, obviously we've just been   in a downtrend pretty much since October, \nright? Since the first week of October and   now we're just moving sideways. And this is what \nI was thinking. I was thinking that let's say we   are in a bare market. Well, what always happens \nduring bare markets? There are long periods of   time that need to actually pass and then there's \nusually a capitulation event and of course there   are deadcat bounces along the way but before the \ntrue bottom is actually hit there is a lot of time   usually a year maybe a little bit less and there \nis a capitulation event and we haven't had that   yet and personally I do think that we are in a \nbare market and we're only 27% off we're not even   let we're not even 30% off of the highs right now. So, because of that, and that's what I'm thinking,   my bias is always going to be more bearish, at \nleast for most of this year, unless something   happens with the price. And so, just looking \nrealistically speaking, we've been rangebound   between 84,700 and 94,000 ever since November \n22nd. and we're yes, it does look a little bit   more bullish right now considering the fact that \nwe created a higher high on the close, but um I'm   still not totally convinced."

And even if we do \ncome all the way up to 97,000 or even above that,   I'm still not convinced that this is going to be \nthe bottom and that's it and now we're just going   to go to new all-time highs. So, I'm taking an \nextreme cautionary approach here. I'm not going to   be buying anything right now because personally, \nI don't really like the way that this last candle   is looking and I don't really like the way that \nthe markets are looking overall. What I'd much   rather do is either look at some other markets and \nsee if there's any opportunities there, or wait   until something comes up where a lot of different \nthings come together, the price looks really good,   enough time has passed, and maybe there's some \nstories that are coming out and some narratives   that could all be used within crypto to make some \ngood trades. But personally, I just don't really   see them right now. One of the only things I did \nsee um you know actually was Zcash, which we're   talking about you know in the actual stream. But \nbesides Zcash and maybe Monero, I don't know too   many other things that I'm super super confident \nabout. So I'm going to continue to just wait it   out until something really really good happens or \nsomething really really bad happens and um I see a   trade setup that makes sense to me. Now, if you're \na scalper, that's a totally different story,   but I'm assuming that 99% of the people watching \nthis aren't scalpers. And I want to make sure that   if I'm going to suggest something that I have a \nlot of confidence in it. And so, with saying that,   that's going to be my TA for today. And \nwe'll just jump right back into the studio. It's It's not an easy market to trade. Yeah. Um, I learned from 2022, like, you know,   you could try to trade certain markets, but \nyou're so much better off just trading when   everything aligns and it's easy. Otherwise, \nthe probability of losing money is just like   too high. And why why even do that? I mean, \nlike remember in uh 20 2019 when the market   ended up crashing, but uh the crypto market \ncrashed, but weed stocks and a lot of the   stock market went absolutely crazy. like we \nshould have rotated into those back then. So,   uh just like how most people I think should have \nrotated from crypto into into gold and silver   this time around. So, I'm just I'm just going to \nchill out. Wait until something you know comes   up and then I'll be more comfortable going in. Nothing wrong with chilling. I tell you what,   there is something wrong with though and that \nis the failure of people watching this stream   to pound the like button sufficiently to get Nick \nwell again. We're only at 20%. That means Nick is   only vomiting 20% less than he was at the start of \nthe start of the stream. Come on, folks. Hit that   like button for Nick. Ever somewhere right over \nhere. Yeah, it's it's somewhere. It's somewhere   down there. It's a big thumbs up. Smash it for \nNick, folks. Poor old Nick. He's uh he needs all   the help he can get, you know. Okay. Uh let's \nhave a look at some of the tweets of the week. What? Okay. Oh, there's Louis again. Hi, Louis. I \nactually also have a twin. Um, good-looking guy,   right? Um, let's start with this one. Uh, this is \nfrom um, Steve. Uh, to the guy who offered me over   1,000 ETH for this guy in 2021. I really think \nyou should send me like 50 ETH for saving you   950 ETH.

Oh, yeah. It's still a   board, I'm afraid. Unfortunately, um it's not \nthe it's not the last bit of nostalgia we're   going to be looking at in this uh in this \ntweets of the week selection, but um yeah,   I mean, wow. Wow. There were articles people sort \nof explaining why they would never sell their ape. I read the article that I don't know if it was \nthis guy but it was whoever had it was probably   a probably a thousand Ethereum. I was like you're \nso dumb. What a time. You are so you are so dumb. What a time to have been alive. Okay, next up \num we have this one um from uh Bernie Maidoff   and Nikita Beer. If you haven't been keeping an \neye on crypto Twitter uh over the last few days   um you'll know that in amongst all the stuff about \nPowell and you know all the geopolitical stuff   um Nikita Beer who is head of product or something \nat X yeah um has just become crypto uh crypto   Twitter's least popular person um he's uh yeah \nbasically people uh reckon that he's sort of has   a hand in suppressing crypto content. Yeah. Yeah. And for good reason too, you know. I mean, look,   just look at this what he says over here. Um, \nbasically he's basically he's saying that you   shouldn't be posting. Um, and you shouldn't \nbe replying to people and communicating with   people online be and and this is crypto Twitter. Like half of the audience on crypto Twitter is   chronically online living in their chronically \nonline people in the world, you know, and he's   basically telling them to engage less of the \nplatform. Yeah. Basically, get off our platform. Like what is it? What is he thinking? Yeah, he \nuh he actually posted a you know the Ben Affleck   having a cigarette meme, right? He basically \nposted that. I think that's I think that's how   tiresome all this got for him. But yeah, there's \nbeen some pretty actually some pretty unpleasant   memes about Nikita Beer going around. But yeah, \nhe is Crypto Twitter's least popular person at   the moment. Um and this has uh resulted in a \nlot of kind of soularching and uh this tweet   from Altcoin Psycho is also pretty good. Hot take, \nbut crypto Twitter doesn't suck because of Nikita   Beer. It sucked far before his time. We had a \nvaporware memecoin frenzy fueled by insiders,   celebs, fake virality, and short-term attention \ngames. Media built on griffs. No one cared because   they were making money. That's when CT. You see, \nI the last part of that is why it didn't suck. No   one cared because they were making money. Okay. But now that we're not making money, now it sucks   even more. Yeah. Okay. And if you add into that, \nyou've also got the likes of uh Ben K. We haven't   selected one of Ben's tweets this week, but Ben \nalso tweeted a graph of uh crypto YouTube views   um which are uh which are not doing well either. So there's a lot of there's a lot of soulsearching   going on in crypto media at the moment, folks. Um meanwhile, we've also got this one uh Grock   who is I mean Grock's had a um a week. Uh Grock \nis also um was asked where it uh where it thinks   we are in the cycle right now. Apparently we're \nin disbelief. Yeah."

Uh dear Hal Finny, uh much missed. um running   Bitcoin. This uh this early tweet from Hal Finny \nabout Bitcoin, someone many people believe to be   Satoshi. And as you see the date there, January \nthe 11th. So that was well that was yesterday. 2009, 15 years ago. Wow. Back back when times \nwere good. 17 years ago before almost everyone   a little math. Don't say it, Bre. Don't say \nit. That's Yeah, this is the this brains of   the operation. Oh, I knew I was getting I should \nhave just said all those years ago, shouldn't I? Don't worry, I don't think anyone uh even \nknew about Bitcoin back then. Any of us. So,   no. Uh H did though. Okay. Um some dates for the \ndiary. Uh on the 13th, which is uh tomorrow, we've   got the CPI. Um and if you really like inflation \ndata, then you'll want to hang around until the   day after that because then we'll have the PPI \nas well. And then on the 15th, um the Clarity Act   is going to be voted on in the Senate. So, this \nThursday. Yes. Um and uh now we alluded to this   earlier, but the looming government shutdown or \nthe possibility of a government another government   shutdown is sort of uh injecting a bit of um a \nbit of jeopardy into this. They kind of Yeah,   we we need them to talk this through pretty quick. Yeah. The people who want it are really trying to   push it, you know, just in case the government \ndecides to say we don't want to work anymore. Exactly. What other What profession can you do \nthat in? I don't like what I'm doing. I'm I'm   going to go home and just like not work. shut \nit down. Yeah. I mean, the American government,   it's it's a source of constant delight and \nconfusion and then they could just come back   and just like everyone still has their jobs \nand like still gets paid.
