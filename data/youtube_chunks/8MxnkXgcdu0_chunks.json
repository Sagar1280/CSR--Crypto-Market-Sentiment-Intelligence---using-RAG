      "text": "[music] 2026. We've officially opened the first three new trades. In today's video, I'm going to show you exactly what those trades are. We're also going to have a look at um a couple of narratives that continue to pump towards the upside. How much higher will they go? Is it time to begin to rotate out of some of those positions uh which we of course took last year which are now in profit. That's what we're going to discuss today. Smash the like button. Let's get straight into the show content. Um, if you just go through to the YouTube video over there, smash the like button, vote in the poll as well. Will this uh weekend with Bitcoin close higher or lower? So, um, I see there's a spelling area over there. Maybe Will, you can just help us over there. Will the week close higher or lower for Bitcoin? Vote over there in the poll and let's get straight into it. Um, I want to start off over here with platinum. This is one of the trade opportunities. However, you're probably going to have to open this on a brokerage account. it's not listed um everywhere. So, one of the things that you can consider on a brokerage account, you're right in the sweet spot over there. You're looking at only 8.2% draw down to invalidate on that trade. Remember, a lot of the metals are moving very, very, very quickly. We've seen gold accelerate those gains. Gold has been one of the other longs that we in. Um not really taking any profits yet, but I will be looking to take some off the table at 4,686. So, we got platinum going. Silver extending those gains. um you know yesterday it wicked into new alltime highs but uh not closing yet at those levels. So a little bit of a pause and consolidation over there. Tesla want to keep an eye out on because uh this is one of the new trades that we've just opened and uh if I can remind you we spoke a lot about and I dropped that in the whale room discord over here earlier on today. Um we spoke a lot about Monero. Monero trading very similarly. There's the Monero trade very similarly in terms of price to what Tesla is in in the sense that this was hanging around that 380 $400 level when we started to well we entered into that trade at 368 but give or take around that $400 level and then you have Tesla as well hang around that $400 level and then we had Monero um and Tesla targets deep into that $700 territory over there. So 733 on Monero and now of course Monero started to play play out a large portion of those gains which I'll quickly go to Monero over here. Um if we just click on that is huge gains extending all the way through now up since the original entry without considering any leverage in that trade 76%. So you could consider starting to rotate out of some of this Monero and possibly into Tesla because Tesla hasn't yet really got properly going. So, that's one of the trades. Now, I've took the liberty of creating three new bots for you guys. We'll just get straight into the meat and potatoes. It's ETH, it's uh the NASDAQ, and it's Tesla. It's all linked in the description below if you do want to copy it. The settings have already been set. You can see the price ranges. Gridding or or um using a grid bot to scale into the trade for ETH down to 3,000 and selling up to 36. uh for QQQ down to 617 and selling up to 660 and Tesla buying around this 418 and selling up to 720. So those are listed below. Those are the trades that are open. Uh you know down 0.3% of course it's busy scaling into the trade into the market open. Um we got Monero up 120% $6,300 over there. So when I take profits on this I'm probably going to start to rotate a portion of that into the Tesla trade. that's part of the the trade idea that we have over there. So, um again, if you do want to participate in that, you can copy that over there. And Pinex are also offering you a $1,000 signup bonus if you use that particular link. Um all righty. So, let's see what else have we got over here. Quick look at Apple. We're expecting Apple to bounce from here. So, we've taken partial profits. Nvidia still um looking slightly consolidative and weak at this environment over here. So, no long trades over there."

Nvidia still um looking slightly consolidative and weak at this environment over here. So, no long trades over there. uh Google building up that massive liquidity. I would look out for actually a short trade on Google the very second that you can create a little bit of a break of structure over here. You're going to absolutely wipe out all of this liquidity. And similar to the Apple trade uh that we took on the short, I think we're going to get a similar trade entry specifically for Google over there. So, that's another one to keep an eye on. Let's have a quick look at um Coinbase is starting to bounce. Uh not yet. Still hanging around over there. Quick look at Micro Strategy. What's Micros doing? Nothing. Consolidating at the lows. Um, just a quick to answer this over here. Um, Thor's hammer 4346 says cannot use the the bots in the UK. Remember, you can use a VPN. For anyone else, if you are getting blocked in terms of using the bots, it may be because you haven't signed up using this particular link. These are um limited to only people that use that particular link. It's for only our community. But um if you signed up somewhere else, it's okay. You can still copy the settings, right? Just to be clear, you can copy the settings. And then let's say, for example, maybe you are uh blocked in the UK and you you don't want to use a VPN because you're very compliant and stand up citizen of the United Kingdom. Well, you can always use whatever other platform will allow you to do. So, the general trade ideas have been given, right? I've even set it up for you with a risk-to-reward ratio. Um so, you can always just take it as a normal trade. Um, that is another option for you. All righty, let's move on. Um, a quick look at the crypto market. Of course, bleak, dismal, not great, right? If you look at the views, this is YouTube views plunging to fiveyear lows. Fiveyear lows, guys. This is absolutely insane. Like, I I cannot believe it. The YouTube views are now lower than what they were were what they were after the FTX collapse when the market was dead boring in December. I remember specifically I was at a beach holiday in South Africa. There was absolutely nothing going on and um uh we below those below those levels. It was brutal. So you need to give yourself a round of applause. And I want to tell you that one of the at least my greatest um you know tips or advice for massive success in life in general is showing up each and every single day. It's remaining consistent. And the reason that I say that is because at a certain level in both business trading, it's all the same thing really. It comes down to showing up every single day and then you focused when the opportunity presents itself. Uh many will call you lucky, right? Uh luck, you do need to strike a certain level of luck in both business and in markets. But it's you the only way that you can be lucky is to be there on the day when luck presents itself. So you guys are going to be part of that group. And this is when you should be paying the most attention actually is when the markets are dead silent. So the fact that we breaking down to new lows and you guys are still here. Um I can tell you with a high degree of certainty that you guys are going to make it, right? You are going to make it. It's the people that come when it's the exciting times. Unless you're super active trader and you can reposition into trending markets, great."

Unless you're super active trader and you can reposition into trending markets, great. Uh but for most people, they're not really good at that and consequently you want to be here each and every single day. So, a little bit of a long story over there, but um I just want to give you guys a big shout out. Well done. All right. USDT dominance should get a little bit of acceleration at some point. This still looks more bullish and bearish, which means that any relief that you're getting right now should be treated as such. It's dangerous long trades. It's a relief rally. Remember, we gave the long trade setup as well, which is beginning to play out. And I told you this is highly risky. I would even go as far as eliminating the risk on that long trade from yesterday. you are spending time above the 50 EMA which is starting to round up which should at least for Bitcoin lead to possibly a bit more acceleration but anything that comes into this area over here would probably be met with a little bit of a deeper pullback in the USDT do dominance which is just kind of like coiling for a greater move. It's just a question of when in my opinion is USDT dominance going to make its run from here or is USDT dominance going to drop a little bit further down into the 50% level and then rally up into the 8% but ultimately I think this 8% region at some point gets touched and any pullback over here on USDT dominance is simply a gift to those who are stuck in positions to get that little bit of an upside move which is your relief which will give you a chance to exit right that is your exit if you have been stuck in major positions. And I would say that the most likely point where that rally would fail is going to be into this yellow box which is situated between 99,600 and up to 103,453 which is your key 50% level of the larger time frame range. Right? I'm going to use the highlighter tool to make it absolutely crystal clear. High time frame range. There's your 50% level. I think price will probably struggle to get through that. So any rallies up into here is an opportunity to offload spot positions that were giving you an absolute headache a few weeks to months ago when we're hanging around down here. So relief rally in play uh that's happening over there. This is going to be a cluster of massive resistance confluent with the daily of what I just showed you $98,000. Um if price can recapture back above that yellow exponential moving average and keyword it must be angled towards the upside. Well, then we can [clears throat] start to talk about maybe it's all back on, right? We're following the business cycle. Many of you will hear the business cycle. It's a 5year cycle. It's not a four-ear cycle anymore. It's a fiveyear cycle. Of course, I do not subscribe to that theory. I believe this is a relief rally and will probably be faded. But as the trader that I am, if we can recapture that and hold above it, I will gladly get long again. But not right now. Right? Until that happens, I have to treat it as a relief rally. So if we look at long to short ratio relatively balanced in the market um and it's probably a good time to also pull this next. So just to reiterate this point of how the masses are just absolutely exiting uh the markets because um if we scroll down and we go over here to the total liquidations 24 hours 217 million guys this is very very very very low."

So just to reiterate this point of how the masses are just absolutely exiting uh the markets because um if we scroll down and we go over here to the total liquidations 24 hours 217 million guys this is very very very very low. A normal day in crypto should be liquidating at least half a billion dollars worth of people. That's an average day. So sitting at 217 million actually mostly longs getting liquid liquidated which is insane considering that prices are slowly trending higher just shows you how leverage those guys must be. Daily exchange volume also starting to turn back down. There it is you know um wind is out the sales. The wind is out the sales. uh the the the boat can't move forward unless the wind comes back in the sales and this trends towards the upside and we've been actively tracking that and that just shows you why this is dropping off like an absolute stone over there. Um so we have that we have the funding rates which are very very very marginally negative still sitting in that uncertainty zone uh confluent with the Bitcoin sentiment tracker sitting at 26. So, low sentiment. It could pick up a little bit more. I could imagine if you start to hit that psychological $100,000 mark, you're probably going to get um the sentiment up there maybe back into like the 40s in the doubt zone, right? You'll reenter into that doubt zone and that's probably where they get slammed back down again. So, uh ETF flows lackluster. Nothing going on over there. Very, very, very boring. Um and I think that is the main point to be made when it comes to our dashboard. So, let's move on. Price recontracting. we're going to start to get those blueprints. Once again, remember following the blueprints, we tend to see big moves. In this instance, that compression when it expanded led to a downside move and therefore it's my hunch or feeling that we probably going to see something similar, right? Recontraction will get those blue bands printing over here. Ballinger bands will squeeze in. We'll probably be testing around that 100k zone and that's going to be your bearish retest where before expansion, you'll probably lead for the next leg down. Um, all righty. And of course, what changes that? Well, if we can get back above the 21 EMA, we can reposition our mindset um and and adjust, right? So, volume profile, point of control, still in that bare flag, still struggling. Volume is still dropping off. All confluent with the daily exchange volume, all confluent with the views diminishing over there. So, big moves happen following low volume. Well, typically they go in the direction of the trend, which is down. That doesn't mean that we absent of trades, right? We're still taking trades. You can see them over here. Um, in especially in other markets, so don't be an ostrich with your head in the sand. There's always something going on out there. There is always trades. Liquidity building on the downside still low. We want that over about 100 million. Uh, nothing really major to write home about. Momentum oscillator still moving towards the upside. Money wave moving up. Getting a green dot after the red dot. So, potential for that higher low. And basically, this is the plan of action, right? bearish retest and then nuke it back down again which means temporarily long into that zone. So cautiously long not maybe not temp it is temporary as well but the right wording is probably extremely cautiously long coming into this as a bearish underside retest failing at this order block over here which is going to be around 102 and then I think that thing's going to get smacked back down again. Uh so there's your long trade risk is eliminated."

Uh so there's your long trade risk is eliminated. getting above $93,000 will be the first big hurdle and that would open up a new trade opportunity which I'll give you another long then uh back up to that 100k zone uh which means basically it'll be long from here long from here TP at the top and new stops would be placed below um if you've missed the trade that we gave yesterday for bitcoin okay so those are the main trades that I wanted to give remember all of this has been dropped in wh room in the discord over here as alongside new metal trades as So if you want any of these things over here, you guys know where to find it. It is in the discord. Remember we spoke about this trade for quite some time. This is while it just loads up over there. It's QQQ NASDAQ. So that's the basis of the NASDAQ trade which I didn't cover. Um it is taking a bit of time to load. But anyways, let's go to it on Trading View over here because we didn't cover that one. Quick look at NASDAQ. What's going on over here? So this is the trade idea. You basically want to see follow through on this ASAP. Uh I'm going to leave the stop in exactly the same place. You've spent a bit of time over here. You've attempted this trend line a couple of times. As soon as you can start to close three candles above here, that should be enough to accelerate uh the QQQ or NASDAQ up to about 657. Um all righty. Okay. What else? What else? What else have we got today? So, we've covered that. Um we can go through the XMR trade. Look at that acceleration higher. Beautiful, beautiful trade now up 77.7%. So, we're looking at almost 100% move, 99. And you know, it may continue. It may continue, but it's probably wise if you didn't take any profits when it hits this level to at least take one/ird off the table, right? You should have no risk on the table now. You should have moved stops to break even. Uh, take one/ird off the table, rotate that into Tesla, and you can do that using the Pinex part over here. This is where we took the original XMR trade as well. Okay, so all in all, that's looking good. What about its little brother or little sister? What do we which one is it? I don't know. Maybe they're cousins. Maybe they're just friends. Zcash still bearish on Zcash. I still think Zcash is going to trade back down to 303. And if Zcash trades back down to 303 and lose loses 303, well then it's in Cooked Town, right? Cooked City. It's going where Micro Strategy is going and it will actually look very similar to Micro Strategy. So there it is. Basically Zcash's 303 level is the equivalent of Micro Strategy when I was trading over here. So that's what I'd be looking for next. Um and there we have Dan Ren calling them kissing cousins. Uh yes. [laughter] Okay. So that's what we got over there. What else have we got? Let's have a look at a couple of other things. Um, okay. I'm going to quickly go to I've got you I've got you guys in the chat. I read all the comments. Um, I I saw early on uh OKB, right? It was OKB. You guys wanted those short trade updates that we had a short trade idea on for some of the exchange tokens. So, let's have a quick look at some of these. We had the BitGet token, right? That was one of them. Uh, we said that these look ready to go down a whole lot more. You need to get a trigger plan, right?"

You need to get a trigger plan, right? So given the rest of the market, I would I would um you know be very very very careful with the short trades now while Bitcoin is potentially putting in that relief because this could spike up higher. So don't activate these trades yet. Wait for the trade to activate based on Bitcoin rejecting and going down. Bitcoin is your broader index, right, that you look at. If Bitcoin goes up, typically you want to be careful on short trades. If Bitcoin is going down, that's confirmation that these things are going to accelerate down a lot quicker. So, that is for Bitcoin. Bitgate, what about OKB? Well, it's the same thing. OKB is starting to spend time under this trend line. So, it's maybe worth having a bit of a position uh stop loss in the same place. Nothing's really changed over here. These trade setups remain the same as what they were last year. You just kind of need that acceleration and follow through towards the downside. So, those are the main ones over there. How's SPX doing? SPEX6900. I really need to see Murad's um wallets. If anybody has those uh especially if you're in whail room, please send them send them in the in the ask the team or not the ask the team in the traders chat section. I'd love to see what Murad's wallets were. I remember at one point his wallets were trading at like weren't they hundreds of of millions or something? The lowest that I think I remember seeing it is like 50 million. So I wonder what it looks like now after all of this is has come down. Um yeah, nothing really bullish over here. This needs a lot of time to reaccumulate. Uh virtuals we can have a look at. I remember once upon a time virtuals was doing really well. We can have another look at that. Virtuals. Virtuals. Virtuals. What is going on over here? Um not much. Okay, not much. I think it's just lower lows and lower highs. Ultimately, this will eventually trade back down between 30 and 45. Unfortunately guys, it is what it is. Um I just hope that you know you didn't get cooked on this and I actually remember clearly explicitly and you can go back the easiest way you can always go back to see what I said at a particular point in time. Go back to this candle over here on um in the middle of January. I said I believe this is a complacency bounce and it was very similar to what I'm saying about Zcash right now. That's what I was saying about virtuals. Um and down we went. Okay, pump. Let's have a look at pump. Most of these there's absolutely nothing going on. Honestly, it's um they're in the middle of no man's land. So, this is trying to recapture or reclaim this. Is this going to be a deviation? Possibly. But on pump, you can't really tra change this trend properly until you clear that. So, what I would probably see for pump, and I'll expand this a little bit better for you guys to see, you're probably going to do something like this at best, right? This is your best case scenario is you're probably going to range a little bit like this. Um, you know, could you spike up like that? Sure. If you do, then you can call this your breakup structure. Any throwback that occurs back into a midpoint, like a 50% level, you'll get a cleaner entry. So, I wouldn't really be looking for any trades on these things. Now, if anything, you're looking to fade them. Okay. What else? What else? What else? Uh, let's quickly have a look at the perexes, which are super hyped up. So talking about hype still I think it's coming down."

So talking about hype still I think it's coming down. We hit target number one. We're coming for target number two at 1956 and thereafter target number three at 1720. We got ASA which looks like it wants to go lower. We got wow lighter full distribution over there. You ran the one side of the trading range better seen on the hourly chart right? You ran one side of the trading range ran the other side of the trading range came all the way back down. um full-on distribution over there and uh this is typical of new things as they launch always overhyped and then they get absolutely annihilated. So where's how quickly our measuring tool over there? Let's have a look. So currently down 37% in my experience these things tend to go down 70% at least once you put in the major top. Is that the major top though? That's the question. Or could you go higher? Well, if that is the major top, my expectation would be this will drop under $1. And no one wanted to hear it when, for example, uh, we looked at this and and there it is, right? I have my little measuring tool. There's the little measuring tool. We said from top down to bottom 70 to 80%, how far did this one go? This was on on um on AA. Well, even as of right now, Aster is down 71%. Okay, so it is what it is. It's the way that it works. That's the way the cookie crumbles. Um, what else? Canton, we can have a look at. Hopefully, I've got the right ticker. Let's just try to pull it up Canton Network. We'll go with the one on Mexi. Let's pull it up over here. It looks really good. Really, really good. It looks like it wants to expand higher. Um, you know, there it is. That's the level wants to expand higher. Possibly a high low, but also something that's relatively new. Unless I'm missing the the left hand side of the chart. According to this, relatively new, which means it's always high risk, right? Always high risk. Um so yeah once you break above this height 16 it should move into price discovery. Okay we can have a look at useless as well which is a meme coin. So useless consolidating into resistance right. Um basically you want to flip this level. If you can get back above 1447 great otherwise I'll be looking for another move down and that's ultimately going to move you back down to the lows at about 0.00588. That would be the level. Um, Salon is in no man's land, guys. We've looked at this every day. Nothing going on over here until this. It's about $100. Okay. Nothing go going on over there. There is an incentive for you guys. I'm going to be giving away free money. So, if you like free money, listen up. All you have to do is go through to the link in the description below. Um, click on Bit Unix over there.

So, probably a bit wrecked as well. Uh, very wrecked. Extremely wrecked. There it is. There's your chart. It's It's terrible. Absolutely terrible. Most of these coins are on their way to zero. Like, quite literally, guys. I I know it that it sounds like an exaggeration. I'm not saying that for, you know, for um clicks and views or something like that. I genuinely mean it. I genuinely mean most of these coins are just going to bleed out to literal zero. I think they're going to be delisted by exchanges. I think that over the following years, you'll never see as many coins as you will in the next couple of years being delisted from exchanges. That's how bad I think it's going to be for most of these. There's too many coins, too little liquidity. Um, it's the paro principle. A select handful of things will win. Okay. Uh, all righty. All righty. All righty. Uh, let's see what else. What else, guys? Uh, we've covered Salana. Um, Pippen. Yes. Let's have a look at Pippen. What's going on on Pippen? Here's Pippen. I I think it's Anywhere you can time a short, right? I'll give you a setup right now. Anyway, you can time a short. I'm pretty sure that this thing is cooked. Um, and I think it's going down as well to join its friends near zero. So, there it is. That would be your best guess short trade setup. Um, you know, looking at an 89% downside move. You have to scale in if you want a tighter plan in terms of the short trade. Um, yeah, I mean, the stop is still going to be in the same place. So, how do you work with this? What do you do with this? Well, you'd kind of need to pyramid into that trade. That's what you need to do. Smaller entry near the bottom, larger position size as it gets closer towards the stop loss over there. But that's what I'll be looking at. I'll try and get it a little bit more tight. Let's just see what we can work with over here. But that's more or less what you're looking at. Uh let's start on the daily. Okay. So, the daily I believe is pretty cooked. Um I think this is coming all the way back down to about 25. So, what I'll first do is start off by by highlighting where I believe it's on its way to. It's on its way here. So, you want to profit from that. Um, let's have a look at the 12-hour invalid. The tight invalid or the best invalidation is still going to be above those highs, which which is what makes it difficult on these types of charts. But you're already closing like you can see the structure is being completely lost, right? So you got, you know, higher lows, higher lows, higher lows on a closing basis. Price comes down, higher low, price bounces up. What does it do? I mean, on a on a tick basis or wick basis, lower high, comes back down, new swing low, lower high. So you got your lower low, you got your lower high. That's it. If you're lucky enough to get something like that, bam, take the short trade. Stop loss goes above here and you're going to ride this all the way back down to the bottom. Okay. Uh I still want to have a look if I can get a bit of a tighter entry though. In any case, let's go on the 4 hour. What's going on on the 4 hour? I mean, this is the tightest I could give you. The tightest entry I could give you is this. This is the tightest entry."

The tightest entry I could give you is this. This is the tightest entry. The ideal stop loss is at 458. The tight stop loss is going to be over here at 38. And you're running that down. Okay. So, I mean, I could take this trade. Should I? Should we? Let me know in the comments. Should we take this trade? Yes or no? I can open up this trade now on the show if you want. Let's see. We'll wait for the feed to come through over there. Yes or no? While you're at it, smash the like button, guys. Help us to get these show content out. Um, and let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Okay, you guys say yes. Yes. Yes. Gridbot it. Well, that was the plan to grid bot it. Exactly. Uh, yes. Do it. Okay, cool. We'll take it. We'll take the trade. So, we'll take the trade as a grid bot. Basically, we are setting the high price at 387. 387. So, let's quickly go to that. We'll pull up Pippen. Uh, there we go. Pippen, go to 387. Futures grid. Um, highest price is what we want. 0 387. And we want to set the lowest price. Let's just put that back on to short. Lowest price. We are setting. I mean, I may as well go for glory all the way down cuz it's obviously gridding on the way down as well. So, I can go even lower. 0.018. 0.018 is what we'll go for. Um 0.018. And number of grids, let's go like 250 and see what that looks like. There we go. So, that's what it looks like. Basically, the red is where it scales into the trade and the and the green is where it begins to TP or take profit. Um, okay. Cool. All right. Look at this. Put your money where your bare mouth is. I'm not sure if that was meant to be insulting, but um I mean, the raccoon has spoken. So, here we go. [laughter] The raccoon has spoken. So, let's quickly I'll put in about it is on 3x leverage, so it's about a $15,000. The liquidation price is above anyway the main invalidation. Um, so I think that's perfect. I'll put 5k in times 3x. It's basically about a $15ish thousand position size. Okay, cool. The raccoon spoke. Um, you know, and I followed through. There we go. Okay, cool, guys. Cool, guys. We've covered a whole lot. We've got a couple of extra trades. So, basically, let's go over what we've done today, what the trades are for today. Uh, we got we got uh Tesla, that was a new trade. That's a long trade. We got QQQ, NASDAQ, that's another long trade. We got ETH as a long trade, but that's super sketchy because obviously it's counter trend. We got Pipp and short trade, which we think is breaking down. Um, and then other positions that we have on the table is still the Apple short trade. Uh, slight profits taken over there. XMR long trade. Um, leaving that position for now, but possibly rotating profits into Tesla. Uh, we have the gold long trade which we're leaving. Nothing changed over there. and Micro Strategy short trade which we're still holding. Even though the TP is very very very close to the final part of where the the trade plan was. Um if it continues to spend time around here, that thing could go a whole lot lower. Um all righty. Manual trade on Tesla from Dan. Yeah, you can do that. You can take the manual trade. Absolutely, you can take it. You don't need to use a grid trade. The grid trade is just to be able to share the bot for for a lot of people that request it. They want the help."

Um this is not my main account guys you know these are for YouTube like my main accounts I I'm trading these things with with proper size right these are just uh accounts to show you guys with real money how to scale into the position but it's not like I'm not doing that to try and buy a house um you know this is this is uh to show you how to enter into the trade but still be attached to the psychology of real money of course this I don't want to lose $100,000, which is what this this account has in. Okay. Um, what else? What else? What else? What else have we got? So, we've covered the trades. I've given you everything that you need to know. Let's see what the market brings today. I think there are some economic events that are going to be coming out as well some data. Let's let's have a look. Uh, we checked this yesterday, but I've already forgotten. So, we'll just have another quick look over here. We got uh okay CPI uh retail sales that is the 14th existing home sales jobless claims. So a couple of things leading into the end of the week. I wouldn't want to really be bullish probably beyond this week uh because then we're going to be repositioning into the next uh pendulum swing of the moon phase back into the bare moon and any you know pump that we get this week is probably going to be faded in my opinion especially if the volume continues to diminish. So basically very short-term bullish on some of these things just for a relief rally bounce medium to longer term bearish unfortunately that's the way that works. Um, all right. I'll see you guys all on the next one. I hope you all have a wonderful day. Thank you so much for joining. We'll catch you tomorrow and cheers for now."
