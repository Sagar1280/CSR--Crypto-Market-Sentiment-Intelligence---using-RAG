      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the macroverse. Today we're going to talk about the most recent labor market report and of course also the impact on financial markets. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up and check out the new website at bjamancow.com. We also have into the cryptoverse.com still, but if you do want to check out the new one, uh I will be publishing some reports from there uh before too long. They actually have some reports from 2020 if you guys want to go read them uh to see how well they aged or lack thereof in some cases. Uh but maybe we'll try to get those spinning up again sometime soon. It's been about 6 years since the last one was published. Um so do go check that out at the new website.com. Now the unemployment rate actually dropped to 4.4%. And actually last month it came in at 4.6 six, but it was res revised down back to 4.5. So, it looks a little less nonlinear. It looks a little bit more controlled than it looked a month ago when it was just going straight up. So, that is at least some silver lining that comes from this. If you look at a three-month moving average, it is still very much heading in the wrong direction. But what's what's notable is despite the fact that the unemployment rate has been going up, it's not really because of layoffs. If you look at initial claims, they're still relatively low, right? Initial claims just came in at 28,000. I have said frequently for probably the last 3 to four years that there is no recession until initial claims are printing above 300,000. So until that happens, it's just something that people can worry about. But until you see initial claims printing higher, uh I don't think you have a recession that is sort of materialized. And in fact, if you look at the recession risk dashboard, which we have on to at the end of the Cryptoverse website if you want to um check it out, we have employment risk, national income and product risk, production and business risk. We've had this these risk metrics on the website for for years now. And you can see that the risk on them still remains relatively low, right? Like that's not to say you won't ever have a recession. It's just that the risk has been below.35 on the employment risk basically since 2020. And what's also happened is the stock market has just continued to grind higher higher and higher and higher. And yes, absolutely. Will will the stock market find a top at some point and and get a correction in 2026? Yes. Usually we have a correction early on in 2026 and then another correction in Q3. That would be my guess. But it goes to show you when you look at at say a risk metric like this that shows you, hey, it's actually been relatively low risk for the last few years. Whether you look at employment risk or national income and product or production in business, they've all been relatively low risk for a number of years now. Really suggesting that it has not uh been a recession and that the best thing you could do was just to stay invested. And with index funds, that's all I ever do is I just basically stay invested. Even when we go up to high risk levels, I still don't usually sell unless I really need the money for something. Um, like when I bought my house at one point, I I sold some index funds in order to just have a little bit more liquidity to buy. But a lot of times, even when we get to high risk levels for index funds, I just don't bother, you know? I just don't. And maybe I should, maybe I but but I mean it's worked out so far. And I mean, I'm sure at some point we'll have a larger downturn, but for the most part, low expense ratio index funds are in fact the way to go. Now, if you go look at well, I mean metals as well. I mean, obviously the the bull market really is in metals right now over over stocks. Even though stocks are at all-time highs, metals are are doing a lot better. But if we go through some of the different reports, right? So, I want to look at at job openings because they actually continue to drop, right?"

But if we go through some of the different reports, right? So, I want to look at at job openings because they actually continue to drop, right? They they've actually dropped back down to 7.15 million and and it's a little bit higher than the prior low in September, but it is getting kind of low, right? In fact, if you go over to the workbench, we can we can add in a new sort of a new chart. We can look at uh the macro and we'll go to um sorry about that. We'll go to job openings. We'll add that on. So, you got job openings. And then what we want to look at is um the number of unemployed workers, right? The unemployment level. Okay. Okay. So you have you have two charts or or yeah two two series right here. You have the the job openings and the number of unemployed workers. So now what we want to do is we want to look at we want to add a formula where we look and this the reason why we do this is because Jerome Powell frequently references this metric. If you listen to his listen to what he says which I'm sure everyone does. I mean, what's more riveting than listening to someone talk about monetary policy for an hour every every so often? I can't think of anything, especially on a Friday night. If you look at the number of job openings per available worker, what we can do is we can say, all right, we're going to take M1 divided by M2, right? So, US job openings is M1, unemployment level is M2. We're just going to evaluate that. We can now hide the other two things and just look at this metric. And what you'll see, and let's actually switch this over to a linear scale, it's actually dropped below one, right? So now there's about 918 job openings per available worker. Now, right now, it hasn't really been an issue because layoffs have been relatively low, right? If you go look at layoffs and discharges, which we get we we frequently get updates for, we just got a couple of days ago, it's it dropped, right? And it's basically at pre- pandemic levels. Yes, there are people that get laid off, but there's always people that get laid off no matter where we are in the business cycle. There's always been this kind of steady hum of layoffs that's just below two million. So, what we're seeing now isn't really that different than what we saw pre- pandemic. Is it increasing? Yes. Right. Like, is it going up? It it it's it is going up, but it is still at levels comparable with what we saw pre- pandemic, right? We haven't really seen a major surge. And you could argue that's one of the reasons why the unemployment rate hasn't really gone into that nonlinear phase is because while hiring is down, if you look at hiring, that actually I believe came in lower. Um, total non-farm hires I think it it it I mean it well, let me see if I can get this low. It dropped uh back down. So, it's now at 5.12 million. So, hires is down, hires are down, job openings are down, but the unemployment rate isn't really screaming higher. It's slowly going higher. The reason it's not screaming higher and going into this nonlinear phase, which typically corresponds to recessions, is because layoffs haven't really picked up yet. The reason layoffs haven't really picked up yet is, you guessed it, because the stock market continues to go higher. Now, how do you get a recession when the stock market goes lower? The stock market leads. It does not lag."

The reason layoffs haven't really picked up yet is, you guessed it, because the stock market continues to go higher. Now, how do you get a recession when the stock market goes lower? The stock market leads. It does not lag. You cannot look at the at the unemployment mark the unemployment rate and see it, you know, it's not going to jump to like 7% in in a month or or even a few months if the stock market continues to go up. Now, could the unemployment rate continue to slowly go higher? Absolutely, because people aren't really hiring as much. So, if you don't have a job, it's harder to find one. But if you have a job, most people that have jobs aren't actually getting laid off right now. And so that's why the market continues to climb the wall of worry. I mean, if you look at uh if you were to overlay job, I wonder if we have it here on on trading. If not, I can show it up on the website. If you look at job openings and you you overlay it with the stock market, normally they track each other, right? I mean, you can see normally if job openings is dropping or going up, the stock market's doing the same thing. This is the only time in history we have the data for where the stock market's going up and job openings are dropping. So, which one is wrong? Right? Which one is wrong? Is it the stock market that's wrong? Is it job openings that's wrong? It's tough, right? Because one continues to drop, the other continues to climb, and at some point there's going to be a snapback. Whether it be job openings going up because of maybe they they turn the money printers back on, they lower rates back to zero, everyone starts hiring because everyone wants to take advantage of the AI craze. Uh or liquidity runs dry and and interest rates stay too high for too long and this snaps back. My guess is it'll be a combination of the two, right? Like I don't like you you probably will have job openings go up um at a time when the stock market starts to fall. And the reason for that is that as the stock market starts to fall, rates will go down, the money principles will come back on, openings will likely start to go up. They might not go up as quickly as people think because so I think some people think that openings will go back up the minute they lower rates. There's a reality where if they lower rates a little bit, it might not have any effect because if if a lot of companies feel like they can hire people or they can just use AI instead of hiring freshly new graduates, that might be something that causes the Fed to arguably be too late on. like, you know, do they think that if they lower rates 50 basis points that all of a sudden hiring is going to come back? What if it doesn't? You know, what if they lower 150 basis points and then hiring still doesn't come back? That's probably the narrative for whenever that recession whenever we get to the end of the business cycle, right? That'll probably be the narrative of, oh crap, maybe lowering rates isn't going to bring hiring back for some industries because it's been replaced by AI. Now, that's sort of the pessimistic view. That's the glass half empty point of view. The the more optimistic view as well is if you think back to the dotcom era, uh while there were some jobs that were destroyed, there were also a lot of new jobs created. And so the AI industry will likely create a lot of new jobs. Who knows how long that transition phase will ultimately last. Now, let's continue to go through. Uh if you look at the youth unemployment rate, we're going to just stick to the United States for now."

And so the AI industry will likely create a lot of new jobs. Who knows how long that transition phase will ultimately last. Now, let's continue to go through. Uh if you look at the youth unemployment rate, we're going to just stick to the United States for now. Um that has continued to go up, right? And now that's at 10.6%. It hit a low this cycle back in April 2023 at 6.6. So, you can see that the youth unemployment rate is really going up. People aren't really hiring young people as much. And this shows you, you know, that that that it's harder to find a job than it is for that that it's more likely to you're more likely not to be able to find a job than those people that already have jobs getting laid off. Um if you look at a map of the states where the unemployment rate is rising over the last 6 months you know there's definitely pockets of the nation where it is going up but it's been like that for years off and on right like where you can find uh pockets like if you look in 2023 there's some pockets there 202 late 2023 2024 what does a recession look like? It's like when you go back to 2001 where it's literally the entire country. When it's not the entire country, like right now, the market will look for the silver lining. It'll climb the wall of worry because hey, maybe you're feeling a recession if if you're over here or up here, but these guys in here, well, it's okay. Like it it seems like it's okay where they are. And so the market will constantly look for that. Now, when it hits everywhere at the same time, that is when you get a recession. And if you look at challenger job cuts, that actually dropped back down, right? They dropped back down. Um, now if we continue on, there's some other things we can look at as well. Um, if we go, let's just go back through through these over here. We can look at employment statistics. Usually, what I like to do is go through some of the uh the non-farm Well, let's look at total temporary health service employees because that kind of leveled off for a little while, but now it's continued to drop. That's kind of that does kind of pose an issue. Hopefully they can get that under control. Non-farm private payroll employment level. This one looks like it's leveled off a little bit here. If you look at a year-over-year, you can see it's been dropping back down. Now, it has not gone negative, but it is going in the wrong direction. If you look at the employment level for the establishment establishment employment level, it also looks kind of like it's starting to plateau a little bit. And it's not that far away from going negative, right? It's currently at 584,000. over the last year. You can see that when it goes negative, that's historically when recessions occur. Is it going to go negative? I don't know. If it does, it's still going to be several months away, more than likely, because even if you zoom in here, it was at 857, now 584. It's still going to take at least a month or two, I imagine. Um hopefully things pick back up before then. But you can see it is in fact trending in the wrong direction. Now, note that not all recessions are the same. Sometimes you get recessions where you just have a 20% drop and sometimes by the time you have this drop, the recession's already behind you. And note, we did already have a 20% drop back in April. So again, while sometimes things might seem obvious, they're not always obvious. Um markets have a way of pricing things in far before it's obvious to, you know, everyone else."

So again, while sometimes things might seem obvious, they're not always obvious. Um markets have a way of pricing things in far before it's obvious to, you know, everyone else. Now, if you look at the household survey, that has continued to slowly climb, which is funny because for a while that had plateaued and it was the other one that that was in fact um climbing. Let's look at a couple more. Um I I want to look at manufacturers new orders. Uh this one has has also kind of struggled for a little while to to durably go higher. There was a couple of other ones that I I think are always useful to check in on um like the smooth recession probability indicator. So what it says is as of December the odds that the United States is in a recession was 94%. So relatively low as of December 2025. And if you look at the SM rule recession indicator um as of as of this month you can see that it it and we had sort of that false trigger here. It is starting to go back up but still has not yet triggered again. If you look at a map of the states where the sum rule has triggered only a few states not as as concerning. We look at composite leading indicator. It it hasn't really rolled over yet. It's still up at these highs which still seems okay. The the coincident economic activity index. Uh, this is one that I think you should look at the year-over-year change. Still well above going below zero, which is where recessions typically reside or in the path to zero. And that one's still holding up relatively well um above where all prior recessions have occurred. That essentially covers, I think, what I wanted to cover. I don't want to go too long on this stuff, but you can kind of see where things are. And because the unemployment rate came in lower than expected, if you go look at at expectations of a rate cut, they've actually dropped. So today, the the odds of a rate cut um or the odds of staying keeping rates constant at the next meeting um uh in late January, January 28th, they were 95%. Whereas, you know, a month ago, they were 69, almost 70%. So, the odds of of the Fed holding at 3.75 has increased, which is notable because, as we've said before, if you look at the the Fed funds rate, right, if we go look at the Fed funds rate, you can see it's at 3.75%. Now, if you look at the 2-year yield, it's at 3.5%. So, arguably the Fed funds rate, if you treat the 2-year yield as the neutral rate, which maybe you shouldn't, but that's what I do, then you could argue that we're still in sufficiently restrictive territory, which means that there are still headwinds for the economy in terms of monetary policy. And in order to become more expansionary, we would want to see lower interest rates, which we still have not yet seen. Um, so this is essentially going to just simply delay on when we actually get those those further rate cuts because of that. And so what we've seen is we've seen the stock market continue to do well. It's now at 6973. If you look at futures are already at 7,000. What about crypto? Crypto still stuck in traffic on Struggle Street. And one of the reasons for that, as I've explained many times, is if you look at this cycle compared to the 2019 cycle, Bitcoin is doing exactly what it did back then where it stalled out against the S&P and it dropped right when quantitative tightening ended. And as interest rates kind of came down a little bit, but not not down enough to really propel the next bull market. You can see that Bitcoin came down in 2019 against the S&P. This is Bitcoin divided by S&P while QE was going on."

This is Bitcoin divided by S&P while QE was going on. Right now, you could argue we're at the beginning stages of the end of quantitative tightening in the beginning of QE. Bitcoin has been dropping against the S&P during that time. Very similar to 2019. You can also overlay interest rates and see something extremely similar, right? You had these rate cuts. Um during those rate cuts, Bitcoin underformed the S&P. And of course, during these these rate cuts, Bitcoin's also underperforming the S&P. So, Bitcoin hasn't really liked it. It probably it's sort of further up the risk curve. It needs that liquidity and when the unemployment rate is kind of almost like there's not really a great winning scenario. Um, in order for Bitcoin to really get moving again, I think there needs to be justification for much looser monetary policy and the report today isn't really giving that justification. Metals seem to like it, right? Gold's still doing well, palladium, uranium, silver, all still doing really, really well. Um, hopefully that continues. Remember, there is always a bull market somewhere, even if it's not uh in in crypto. You don't have to just sit around pining for an alt season because some influencer told you it was going to happen. There's plenty of money to be made in other markets. As long as you're willing to to look to see where the bull market is. Don't marry an altcoin. Don't marry an asset class. Okay? If if there's a bull market somewhere, don't ignore it because you have some type of bias against that asset class. Just recognize there's cycles and sometimes metals do well, sometimes stocks do well, sometimes crypto does well, sometimes cash even does well relative to the others. It's important to recognize what phase we're in at any given time.
