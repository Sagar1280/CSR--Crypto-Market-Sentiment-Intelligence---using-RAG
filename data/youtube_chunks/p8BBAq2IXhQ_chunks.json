      "text": "What if the four-year cycle everyone's been watching isn't the cycle Bitcoin is actually moving on? People are split right now. Some think the four-ear cycle top is in and bare market has already started. Not you guys though, right? Others think the cycle doesn't matter at all anymore. But when you stop looking at the calendar and start looking into the data, you realize something wild. the cycle most people think ended. Guys, it hasn't even really begun. And before we even step into the data, let me say this clearly. This isn't the first time I've talked about the cycle shifting. I've been covering this for months, long before everyone else started coming out of their maybe the four cycle is broke in takes. And even the people who were calling for a new bare market a few weeks ago are now changing their tune. So if you've been following this channel, you're already ahead of most in the conversation of what's happening today. And again, remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. All right, guys. Let's start with what the market's head is actually right now. Because the last stretch created one of the strongest emotional whiplashes we've seen all cycle. Fear was thick in the air during the drop. Traders were jumpy. People were even calling for an early bare market before the move ever had a chance to form its real direction. Short-term holders, which basically means the newest and least committed buyers, took almost $1 billion in realized losses. Ouch. That kind of loss doesn't come from a thoughtful strategy. It comes from panic. It comes from people hitting the sell button because the price dipped and they didn't have a plan. If you zoom out to the whole network, unrealized losses hit around $ 160 billion during the worst parts of the sell-off. When the market reaches that level of stress, it tells you the crowd is underwater and reacting completely emotionally. That kind of pressure always changes the energy in the room. Bitcoin right now, uh, as time recording is around $935,000, $94,000. And many are wondering if this is just a a bear trap or if this is you know if we did have have if we have seen the top and the idea for that is kind of simple. We had we had the having we had a move up price pulled back that must be the top here everyone saying it. It's easy to believe when all you see is red on the screen. I mean today you got some green but since October 10th we've been pretty red. But while retail is throwing in the towel, the bigger players are quietly adjusting their positions. Digital asset investment products, the kind you buy in a normal brokerage account, pulled in $716 million in inflows last week. That's two strong weeks backto back.

I mean today you got some green but since October 10th we've been pretty red. But while retail is throwing in the towel, the bigger players are quietly adjusting their positions. Digital asset investment products, the kind you buy in a normal brokerage account, pulled in $716 million in inflows last week. That's two strong weeks backto back. Money came in from the United States, Germany, and Canada, where inflows come from multiple regions at the same time. When inflows come from multiple regions at the same time, it usually means this isn't just a passing mood. Someone with conviction is buying. Inside those products, Bitcoin alone saw $352 million in net new inflows. Even more interesting, the products that benefit when Bitcoin falls just saw their biggest outflows since early last year. That tells you something important about positioning. Traders who were betting on lower prices are backing out. Traders who want exposure are stepping in. If this truly were the end of a cycle, you wouldn't be seeing this aggressive buying interfere. You wouldn't see global inflows. You wouldn't see bearish products being unwound. Behavior gives you the truth long before the price does. And the behavior here points toward accumulation. And guys, of course, we're going to talk about Powell's speech today, but we'll get into that. And here's where the story gets even more interesting. Long-term holder supply is behaving in a way we haven't seen at any previous cycle top. In past cycles, the peak lined up with a single major flush of long-term holder distribution. One huge supply event that mark the end. This time, we're seeing multiple distinct supply zones forming instead of one giant release. That pattern doesn't signal a cycle ending. It signals a cycle transitioning. a market shifting hands and stages rather than blowing off all at once. And while long-term holders distribute in controlled phases, the biggest conviction buyers stepped right back in. Michael Sailor just announced another $1 billion Bitcoin purchase and Tom Lee added more than $400 million in ETH the exact same day. These are digital asset treasuries buying size into fear using the volatility to their advantage. Bad behavior does not show up at the market top. It shows up when the strongest players want more exposure while the crowd is still uncertain. Retail focuses on whatever the chart is doing at the moment. Bigger players watch this environment as a chart sits inside. Retail goes by dates and narratives. Institutions follow liquidity and the underlying mechanics of the market. When those two ways of seeing the world point in different directions, you get moments exactly like this one. I mean, the fact that we were supposed to have a top was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

When those two ways of seeing the world point in different directions, you get moments exactly like this one. I mean, the fact that we were supposed to have a top was a self-fulfilling prophecy. I mean, you had essentially a huge sell-off exactly when the prior cycles topped, which is understandable. So, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and we get a big correction like we did. Guys, in just a second, we'll talk about what exactly is happening and what is driving the actual market right now. And I would know, at least I'd like to think that I am because what I've been doing the past few months is trying to to build an irrefutable case of what's going on right now. And you know, this is one of my first research papers. And so, I kind of want to show you guys what I've been working on. It's not ready to go yet, but that I just have to fine-tune some of the charts and some of the data. But essentially, I'll share with you guys right now kind of a sneak peek into what I've been doing. So you can see this basically the executive summary of this 48page paper that we created in house. What it aims to solve guys is this, right? So Bitcoin now functions as a macrosensitive asset. Its price cycles driven primarily by global liquidity and institutional capital flows rather than its programmatic having schedule. Analysis of historical Bitcoin data shows that shift in macroeconomic conditions typically precede having events acting as a principal catalyst for major market turning points. Current onchain signals from quantitative metrics indicate a structural market transformation resulting from significant institutional adoption. This financialization alters market structure leading to fragmented narrative specific rotations in altcoins instead of broad-based rallies seen in previous cycles. So there's a little bit of a hint of what we can see for altcoins moving ahead. However, I do think with some of the recent developments we had since I'm going to I'm going to work on that section a little bit too because my gut feeling tells me that we're going to actually have a proper alt season, not just fine-tune specific ones. But uh but I'll get to that in a bit. This is the important part here, right? So, a probabilistic assessment indicates an extended super cycle. Scenario B, which you will be able to read when I release this report, is the dominant outlook with greater than 60% probability. This scenario posits a midcycle consolidation followed by significant price expansion deviating from the classic 4ear cycle timeline. This conclusion is based on the"

Scenario B, which you will be able to read when I release this report, is the dominant outlook with greater than 60% probability. This scenario posits a midcycle consolidation followed by significant price expansion deviating from the classic 4ear cycle timeline. This conclusion is based on the finding that global liquidity is a primary driver of Bitcoin's price and always has been. The diminishing correlation between cycle tops and having dates when contrasted with the strong correlation to the expansion of the G5 central bank balance sheets supports this macrodriven thesis. And you guys can see as we go through it, it's a detailed paper, right? And we go through all the things in the past. The charts are off right now. I have to fix them, ignore them right now. But essentially, you go through all the past things like real yields, risk appetite, and regulatory legacy, uh, previous cycles, what they've been driven by, and it wasn't the four-year cycle having narrative, by the way, guys. Uh, a little spoiler preview for you. But you can see that we have all of the stuff driven by macro data. And there's some TA in there as well to kind of get a holistic picture of what's going on. But at the end we come up with some probabilistic outcomes and we even show you how we built those uh assumptions and the formulas behind it. So I think this is very fascinating and this is what's been giving me the highest conviction other than what other people have been saying. But anyway, what other people say is important too because there's much bigger banks and things like that institutions that have been doing this a lot longer than I have. So uh this is my thesis. You guys have known it for months since I've been talking about it, but we'll get into some of those other positions in just a bit here. And guys, you all the way back into October, I did uh a video here where I said that this move felt a lot more like mid2020 when we had that big pullback rather than 2021. It just was a midcycle consolidation. And that's exactly what I believe is happening right now. All right, now let's switch gears because this is the part almost everybody is getting wrong. The having cycle became folklore in crypto. People treat it like it controls everything. They point to the past and say, \"Every four years, Bitcoin does this. It feels tidy. It feels predictable. It feels safe.\" But the real world rarely moves on a clean schedule. When you look closer, something much more powerful shows"

They point to the past and say, \"Every four years, Bitcoin does this. It feels tidy. It feels predictable. It feels safe.\" But the real world rarely moves on a clean schedule. When you look closer, something much more powerful shows up. Every time Bitcoin had one of those giant life-changing runs, global liquidity was expanding at the same time. And we go into that into the report. The having lined up with these periods by coincidence, not by control. Go back to 2012 and 2013. The Federal Reserve launched QE3 and added $85 billion a month into the financial system. The Fed's balance sheet climbed more than a trillion dollars throughout that period. Bitcoin went from $10 to $1,000. That move required fuel, and the fuel arrived through monetary expansion. Then look at 2016 and 2017. The European Central Bank ran one of its biggest quantitative easing programs on record, buying around 80 billion e of assets each month. The Bank of Japan was buying government bonds and ETFs aggressively during the same window. China delivered a massive credit impulse that pushed liquidity through its entire economy. Bitcoin climbed from $1,000 to $20,000. In that same period, global liquidity expanded and the asset that responds fastest to liquidity took off. We saw that. And then you get to 2020 and 2021. The world shut down and the central banks launched the largest stimulus effort in modern history. The Fed increased its balance sheet by more than $5 trillion. And what else is $5 trillion? The big beautiful bill now law. Think about that for a second. The ECB and that's just one thing, right? The ECB during that time, the Bank of Japan and the People's Bank of China also pushed liquidity into their systems at scale. Bitcoin surged from around $4,000 to 69,000. When global liquidity balloons, Bitcoin reacts with incredible speed. So liquidity creates this window, right? Liquidity creates the conditions and the having happened to overlap with these expansions which made it look like the having has drove everything. But when you look back at it, how silly is that? It made the chart line up neatly even though the driver was a printing of trillions of dollars. And this isn't just my interpretation. One of the most respected research firms on Wall Street reached the same conclusion this week. You got Bernstein, whose crypto reports are followed by hedge funds, asset managers, and major institutional allocators.

You got Bernstein, whose crypto reports are followed by hedge funds, asset managers, and major institutional allocators. They announced that Bitcoin has officially broken the traditional four-year cycle pattern. Their analysts said the correction we just lived through did not match any prior having cycle top. They see Bitcoin entering an elongated bull cycle driven by sticky institutional demand that absorbs retail panic selling. Bernstein raised their price targets to $150,000 for 2026 and $200,000 for a potential peak in 2027 while keeping their long-term 2033 estimate near $1 million. When a firm with Bernstein's influence shifts a thesis like this, large capital allocators listen. It reinforces that idea. The Bitcoin cycle has stretched beyond the old four-year rhythm and is now following deeper structural forces. To see the real pattern, look at the PMI, the purchasing managers index. The PMI is a simple scorecard for the business cycle. When PMI rises above 50, the economy is no longer contracting. When it rises above 55, activity accelerates and markets usually expand alongside it. When PMI pushes above 60, the environment tends to support the strongest bull run in risk assets. These thresholds can be tracked directly through the surveys issued monthly by the Institute for Supply Management. If you overlay PMI with Bitcoin's historical price action, the alignment becomes crystal clear. Every major Bitcoin run began when PMI was rising through those expansion levels. at every slowdown lined up with the PMI rolling over. The business cycle created the window and Bitcoin followed that rhythm almost step by step. Right now, the PMI is still sitting in contraction territory, which means the business cycle hasn't turned up yet. That lines up with the global liquidity charts showing conditions have stopped tightening but haven't begun expanding in any meaningful way yet. In simple terms, the setup is forming, but the surge that usually drives the biggest Bitcoin movements hasn't arrived yet. And guys, that kind of leads me to what I wanted to tell you about right now. Even though on days like today, we see good news coming out of the Fed. We see everything's in green. We see some altcoins reacting favorably. In my personal opinion, I don't think that we're there yet. I don't think that we can confidently say that we're in an upward trajectory. My personal thought is it wouldn't be I wouldn't be surprised at all if we continue to see mass manipulation throughout the markets. And what do I mean by that?

Well, I mean that we get good news like today, we see prices running up. People start to get bullish again. A lot of leverage comes back into the system and boom, another flush out. So again, not financial advice, nothing in this video is, but be careful playing with leverage. And I do believe that that we have still very volatile times ahead until sometime Q1 next year. I mean, I'm positioned, you know, holding spot and DCAing in anyway. I'm positioned fine for whatever happens. I'm just saying be careful with leverage. Be careful getting over excited currently. But as you all know, my long-term thesis for 2026 and into 2027 possibly is extremely bullish. And when you think about it, the fact if you look at past cycles when this shift in the regime changes from a tightening environment to a loosing environment, that usually lasts a couple of years. So, it wouldn't be surprised at all if we see this going all the way into 2027, but I'm very bullish on 26. All right, guys. Now, real quick, just a quick break. You've worked hard to protect your crypto and your data, guys. said this before, don't be a dumb dumb and let one bad click undo it. NordVPN is the first line of defense.

And now back to the show. All right, now let's move into the part that determines the entire next phase of the market. On December 1st, the Federal Reserve officially reached the end of quantitative tightening. QT ending means the Fed's balance sheet is no longer shrinking and the runoff has slowed to nearly zero. Today, the December FOMC meeting, the Fed followed through with its third rate cut of 2025, taking the policy rate from 4% down to 3.75 and announced it will start buying US Treasury bills again. They let out a plan to purchase around $40 billion of T bills over the next 30 days starting December 12th. wrapped in that careful language about the extent and timing of additional adjustments which basically tells you they want flexibility from here while hinting rate cuts might pause for a while. But guys, tone matters here. The Fed cut again while the guidance and projections pointed to a slower path from here with a median outlook showing just one additional rate cut in 2026 year, right? and clear division among officials. Pal also stressed the T bill purchases are technical reserve management, not a policy pivot designed to boost risk assets. So the message today reads like a cautious easing with flexibility and a real chance of pause. QT ending is an important milestone. And this combination of rate cuts plus fresh tea bill buying is a first real step away from outright tightening into a softer, more supportive regime. Now guys, I'm not a Fed insider or anything like that, but when you line up QT ending, rate cuts, and bill purchases, it can look like the opening of a chapter of QE under a different label, which it almost always is. Even if the Fed frames it as reserve management, the big takeaway is simple. The Fed has shifted from pressing the brakes to quietly easing onto the gas. And that kind of shift usually sets the tone for how conditions evolve into 2026. This new phase still feels messy in real time. The balance sheet tends to move sideways for a while. The Fed runs these smaller targeted purchase programs and the market has to decide whether this is just the reserve management or the start of a full easing cycle. That flat confusing zone shows up again and again right before the balance sheet starts to expand in a way everyone can see. Recently you might have seen the headlines in"

The balance sheet tends to move sideways for a while. The Fed runs these smaller targeted purchase programs and the market has to decide whether this is just the reserve management or the start of a full easing cycle. That flat confusing zone shows up again and again right before the balance sheet starts to expand in a way everyone can see. Recently you might have seen the headlines in social posts claiming the Fed has just injected more than 13 billion into the system. That number came out of a repo markets responding to a short-term cash squeeze among banks. A spike in the overnight repo facility tells you banks needed liquidity for an operational reason and tap the Fed at the end of the day where they could just borrow money. That kind of movement is a stress signal inside the plumbing and points a short-term funding strain rather than a deliberate push of fresh money into risk assets. And the next piece of the puzzle is the TGA or the Treasury general account, which is the government's checking account held at the Fed. The balance of the TGA affects how much cash actually circulates in the financial system. When the TGA rises, liquidity becomes restricted. When it falls, liquidity enters the economy. The TGA is still sitting at elevated levels, which means there is liquidity waiting to be released before the Fed considers a more aggressive easing. If you study the path into prior QE cycles, the rhythm becomes clear. QE tends to begin after three things happen. First, rates fall toward levels where monetary policy cannot rely on rate cuts alone. This was the case during prior QE episodes when the federal funds rates approached near zero. Second, the TGA moves lower and frees up liquidity that can circulate through the banks, credit markets, and eventually risk assets. Third, the economy shows enough pressure that the policy makers choose stimulus over restraint. Rising unemployment and weak ISM reading usually create that environment. The unemployment rate has been ticking higher in recent months, which starts to build the case for easing. ISM continues to signal contraction across manufacturing, which strengthens the argument for support. There is also a political dimension to all of this. Attention around the potential policy shift at the Federal Reserve is growing and discussions about changes to leadership around 2026 have circulated through major financial outlets. The timing of these decisions lines up with the period when easing tends to become more likely. When you line it all up, all those pieces together, QT ending, repost stress signals, TGA levels, economic pressure, and political timing, you can see the broader setup forming.

When you line it all up, all those pieces together, QT ending, repost stress signals, TGA levels, economic pressure, and political timing, you can see the broader setup forming. The important thing to understand is that liquidity environment is transitioning. QT is behind us. The balance sheet is flattening. Economic signals are weakening. The TGA is positioned to release liquidity. Rate cuts remain the tool that will likely come first. Quantitative easing is usually the tool that follows. All of these steps build a progression and that progression moves the market toward expansion. All right, now that we have the full picture of how policy shifts set the conditions, let's look at how the framework points directly to where Bitcoin stands in the broader cycle. So the conversation around the chart sounds shaky right now, but the structure underneath the chart, it tells a very different story. Start with the mining economics. The electrical cost of producing one Bitcoin sits near $71,000 today. This number is important because miners build their entire business around this cost base. When price trades near the electrical cost, it lets you see how much pressure miners can absorb before their operations get squeezed. If you layer in the total cost of production, which includes hardware, cooling, maintenance, and labor, Bitcoin is trading close to its fundamental cost basis. Glass node has tracked this relationship for years. And whenever Bitcoin approaches a one:1 ratio between its price and full production cost, the market eventually responds with a repricing to the upside. These levels act like a floor created by the economics of mining. You may not want to hear that a structural floor could sit down near that $70,000 area, but I feel a responsibility to prepare you for that possibility because while the market is stabilizing above that zone right now, if price ever works down into that zone, history shows those levels have often become one of the best long-term buying opportunities ever. And guys, of course, just to be clear, I'm not saying that Bitcoin is guaranteed to test those $70,000 areas. I'm just saying that it absolutely could and don't be surprised if it does. The point is being prepared. And when you understand the range of outcomes, you stop reacting with the emotion and start reacting with a plan. That mindset is what carries you through the tough moments and sets you up to win long term. All right, now that we've anchored Bitcoin inside its fundamental cost structure and the environment around these levels, let's take a step back and look at how this framework separates Bitcoin from the rest of the market.

All right, now that we've anchored Bitcoin inside its fundamental cost structure and the environment around these levels, let's take a step back and look at how this framework separates Bitcoin from the rest of the market. So, let's talk about strategy because and not just not strategy, the company strategy, but strategy because this is usually where people take the biggest hits in a cycle like this. Bitcoin and altcoins respond to different levels of liquidity environments. Bitcoin reacts early. It responds when fiscal spending grows, when deficits expand, and when the first signs of easing show up. Those forces are already present. They are the reason Bitcoin can build strength even before the business cycle fully turns. And that's important to understand when you look at the big picture. It's a miracle that we even had a bull market at all this time considering the liquidity conditions. Why wouldn't that invalidate everything you've been saying, Kyle? That uh you know, no, it was it was because we're seeing a structural regime shift in the way that Bitcoin is. I mean before it was just retail driven but since the ETFs and the anticipation of what's happening and the US policy shifts and the strategic reserve and countries buying it and pensions getting involved I mean everything has changed and that is what has driven a predominantly bitcoin driven cycle that without those things would have never existed because of the underlying liquidity policy but now the policy shifting tides. Again, people think this is a fouryear driven cycle, but no, it wasn't, right? Nothing was similar to this cycle versus the previous four cycles. And all coins sit further out on the risk curve. They need much more than early policy shifts. They move when liquidity expands in a meaningful way. When balance sheets rise and when the business cycle shows real momentum, they rely on the part of the cycle where PMI pushes out of contraction into full expansion, where confidence returns and investors feel comfortable reaching for higher risk. Those conditions have not formed yet. So, the real big moves in all coins, the 5x, the 10x, the 30x, etc., they tend to show up when the PMI breaks into the expansion zone and liquidity accelerates aggressively. We're not at that part of the cycle yet. And you know this just by looking at your friends, your family, your neighbors, your average retail right now.

They're not they don't have a lot of capital to play the casino, right? And that needs to happen before we can actually get all coin seasoned. And the reason in the beginning of the video I mentioned that I think that things might be changing is because we're going to see a lot of new money come into the markets in 2026 and in the hands of you guys. We're going to see stimulus checks. We're going to see all kinds of uh programs, you know, the the thousand per baby born. We're going to see more stimulus checks than just the 2001, the 2001, I believe, potential income tax uh cuts, all these things, the big beautiful bill and law, which is $5 trillion of spending coming and trickling back into the hands of the people, the interest rates going down to make it easier to borrow money for small business loans to to uh be taken, etc., etc. So, uh, and the ability for people to refinance from their very high rates, uh, to lower rates, which gives them, uh, less expenses every month, which gives them a bit more breathing room and, uh, and maybe a little bit of money to play in the casino. That's what you need for a real altcoin season. All right, guys. With that being said, let's zoom out and like look forward a little bit, okay? Because this is the entire picture where it starts to make sense. We've gone through the policy side. We've gone through the liquidity side, the business cycle, and the onchain structure. When you line those signals up, you can see a market that is still building the conditions that usually set the floor for the next expansion phase. Quantitative heightening has stopped. The balance sheet has moved into a holding pattern. PMI remains in a zone that signals the business cycle is still quiet, waiting for its turn. unemployment has been drifting higher, which often becomes the pressure point that leads policy makers to respond with easing and lower rates. These are early cycle ingredients. They're the kind of markers that show up before liquidity begins expanding again. The important takeaways is that these signals do not describe an ending. They describe a beginning. They describe the environment that usually appears right before the market transitions into the next phase. These pieces are setting up the stage for the next chapter. The part of the cycle we're standing in right now requires patience, preparation, and a steady mindset. This is where long-term conviction forms, and this is where"

They're the kind of markers that show up before liquidity begins expanding again. The important takeaways is that these signals do not describe an ending. They describe a beginning. They describe the environment that usually appears right before the market transitions into the next phase. These pieces are setting up the stage for the next chapter. The part of the cycle we're standing in right now requires patience, preparation, and a steady mindset. This is where long-term conviction forms, and this is where being early pays off more than being reactive. You are watching the conditions that historically lead to expansion. And that is all starting to line up again. They don't move fast, but they build quietly. And when they finally turn on fully, everything starts to happen all at once. That means your edge, you guys watching this, comes by understanding these things before the crowd does. It comes from seeing the setup instead of chasing the outcome. And it comes from preparing for a future that conditions are pulling us toward right now, even if the chart doesn't show it yet. This is part of the cycle where staying educated matters. And this is the part where positioning with intention matters because when liquidity finally turns and when the business cycle wakes up, the market rarely waits for anyone to catch up. And if you guys saw my post on on X, if you're not following me over there, Kyle Shass, uh, a couple weeks ago, I made a post that just, you know, go check it out. Repeat after me, right? And I believe that is still very true. The way to focus on this market is the institutions, the big players, they want your Bitcoin. Don't sell it to them. Don't be using leverage. Dollar cost average in is what I've been doing. None of this is financial advice, but zoom out a little bit. Take a breath. Don't need to do anything urgently right now. We're still a ways away from a real explosive move upward. And I think that even then, it'll be a it'll be a slow structured move up uh in the beginning half of 2026. But who knows? They could be much faster and much more aggressive than I thought. Especially with the new Fed chair coming in in May is expected to be super super dovish. And everything else that we've talked about on this channel before, like the midterms and just everything, guys. We're we're setting up for a major major run. And that's going to be it for today, guys. So, I hope that you enjoyed this video. If you did, make sure you give it a like. If you're new to the channel, my name is Kyle.
