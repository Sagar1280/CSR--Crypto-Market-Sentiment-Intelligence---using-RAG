      "text": "We had Bitcoin as well as some of the other trades that we had been looking at starting to pop yesterday, moving towards those price targets that we had previously outlined. So, for those who were here during the quiet times, a big congratulations cuz you probably participated um in the profits that we starting to see. Now, in today's video, we'll have a look at what to do with those trades. Is it time to start to rotate specifically out of Monero as we're about to hit that key uh take-profit target that we had the main take-profit target which was the measured move coming off of a big cup and handle formation. We'll discuss that. We'll have a look at gold silver as well. There's a lot of news coming out around gold and silver, specifically silver where they're basically saying that they maybe not going to release as much silver anymore and of course that's driving some of the demand over there. So, a lot to look at. What else have we got for today? Um, of course, we'll have a look at how high this relief rally could potentially go for Bitcoin. Is this the start of something bigger? You know, could this be the start of, call it a 2026 super cycle or is that an absolute swear word? Well, you can also vote over there. Let me know in your books what your thoughts are when you go through to the poll. Smash the like button, guys. It helps me get the show content out and then vote over there. what sounds most relevant and correct to you given the current status of the market um for Bitcoin right specifically for Bitcoin relief [clears throat] rally almost over that's 57% of you or is it a silent new bull run that's just brewing in the background is there something bigger at play are we going to reclaim key levels and melt up much much much higher playing catchup to things like gold the S&P 500 Dow Jones and NASDAQ remember NASDAQ's also one of the long trades that we recently put or do you just think it's a huge ranging market? I'd love to get your input. It always helps to see where your guys heads at and that can help me to better guide you and position the content to show you exactly, you know, how to view it from the other side because it's all about validations and invalidations. You know, we're not permabulls or bears or kangaroos for that matter in a ranging market. We're just looking to trade the market and we want to know the bias from both ends. So, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. First thing I wanted to start off with over here was this was crazy. Basically, this went out um from the US Mint suspending all sales of various different products, which basically means they're going to stop selling silver to investors. This is crazy. Silver extending the gains, right? We're going to quickly have a look at silver. Let's go to silver over here. Extending those gains. New alltime highs now trading above 90. $90. Huge, huge, huge moves over there. So, continuation. If you came to the well room live session that we did on Zoom yesterday, remember any of you can see when we go live, it is listed over here. So that was yesterday's session. You have the calendar mounted um on the website over here. We spoke about getting an entry over there as well. If you were looking for a tight entry because you absolutely absolutely wanted to get into the market, um I believe we're floating the stop losses. It was actually below this candle over here. So this was the expansion that led to the upside move, the throwback into there. Stop losses floated over here. You could now pretty much raise those over there possibly. I mean, you can probably even drop it at about 85 given this candle, but this is a parabolic move. So, you probably don't want to um be entering new positions into this in terms of buying physical silver. So, hoarding physical silver, I think it's a little bit late for that. But I think if you're looking for the leverage trades and you just want to hop onto the bandwagon and just let this thing melt up and you want to participate on that rocket ship ride, well, you need to be using the low time frames like the hourly, 4hourly, things like that and trailing a stop underneath a swing low at some point. You're going to put in a massive pullback."

You're going to put in a massive pullback. And I'll tell you when that happens and when that massive pullback takes place, whether that's going to be an opportunity to maybe get into physical silver if you want, right? if that's a a kind of a FOMO emotion that's um pulling on your strings at the moment and you want to get into that. We'll discuss that when relevant at a later date. But I wouldn't get too caught up um in the FOMO post, right? These accelerate those those periods of FOMO. The next thing to look at is gold, right? Very very very important to look at gold because we're still in this trade. We about to hit TP uh or the takerit area 1 4,686. I mean that could hit as soon as today. That for gold is only about a 1% move away. So I'm continuing to hold that position. We will be looking to take some profits over there. I think that a lot of the profits in general can probably be rotated into Tesla because Tesla is still in a really really really good spot for probable continuation higher. So I think if you do want to look for something to rotate maybe out of silver, maybe out of gold, Tesla is a great place to um you know move some of that capital. But one of the things to be aware of on gold as well, which is why we must take some of those profits is if you have a look over here, gold has now outperformed the S&P 500 um for six consecutive months, which is the longest streak since the global financial crisis. Maybe that tells us something bigger is coming. But I think what's more important about this is it's a rare occurrence, right? If you look at this red line that's running across the top of the screen, this is anomalies. This is outside of the norm. When you start to see gold do things like that, doesn't mean that you want to sell all your gold. It just means that typically you want to be cautious that at some point you're probably going to find some kind of a local top on something like gold, right? So that's one of the things to look at. And these markets are going mad, right? You have platinum over here. It's like a altcoin season for the metals, heavy metal season, right? So metals moving towards the upside. We took this trade on platinum as well. You're in the money on this trade only just it hasn't actually properly taken off yet. So we'll see if these guys play the the commodities and metals market similar to what the crypto guys do where you know rotating out of Bitcoin into ETH into Salana blah blah blah. Um you know will that rotation take place? Because silver is the one that's stolen the show. when silver pauses or pulls back, we'll see if some of that money flows into things like like platinum and gold. And then you got the copper bros out as well. You want to see the copper bros? This is crazy. Um this guy sold all of his Bitcoin over here. He's putting it all into physical nickels. And he says over here, yes, you heard that correctly. Here's the math. And nickel is worth 5 cents forever, which is legal tender. But the metal side, the copper nickel ratio between the two is worth 6.2 cents now. So, he's buying money, he says, for 20% discount. If copper crashes, you'll still have 5 cents because um of course that's that's the legal tender price. If copper moons, well, you'll have a fortune, he says over here. Um and I don't know, let me know what you guys think about that."

But um if you if you go into some of the Grock questions that people are asking, is it legal to melt down the coins? No, it's illegal. You cannot melt down the coins. So, this guy's probably going to be bag holding a bunch of coins. Um and he'll probably have to start some sort of a vending machine um business over there where he can provide floats, copper floats for the vending machine guys uh to provide change. That looks like his future. But what does the chart say? Let's go and have a look at the chart over here. So this this is copper. We spoke about this one yesterday as well in wh room. Um I also said I'd basically just be trailing a stop loss over at about 557. Copper trades absolutely wild. This thing is crazy. Look at this over here. Um, remember when this drop off occurred over here? That was a 26% dump out of absolutely nowhere. It was everything was going along swimmingly. Perfect. Throw back into the breakout level of the cup and handle formation and bang. Uh, Bob's your uncle and 26% of your money is gone. And then it started to reaccumulate. So, I told him in the Zoom yesterday, you know, I'm not I'm not a massive fan of trading copper. uh this is also a huge um you know amount of liquidity that's going to be stacked underneath this uh trend that started to form over here. So anyways, let's move on. We're sticking with the with the other things. You guys are fully aware of the positioning that we have. It's all public. It's all been on YouTube over here. Uh if you are in copper, your targets are $8.15, right? That's what I'd be looking at over there for for the CFDs on copper. Moving on to crypto now. We saw some big liquidations take place and I must say I was actually surprised that there were even this many shorts in the market. We saw very low volume, very low liquidity which is always a warning sign with low volume into pumps. So we need to still see that volume pick up. The good news is that you did see a decent volume bar for the recent move that we've had on Bitcoin. But is it going to continue? We need multiple days of that even weeks, right? Because we need to turn this daily exchange volume trend which has just been downtrending. This is your wind out of the sails of the sailboat. The sailboat might be dragged along by the currents, but you can't get any real momentum without the wind in the back of that sail. And for that wind to be in the back of the sail, this must turn back up. For now, it's still down. And then we look at those liquidations. And look at that. Huge, right? Almost $600 million worth of shorts got squeezed, liquidated yesterday. Um, and that brought our grand total to 686 million. So, a couple of late longs, but mostly just shorts that got taken out. I was very surprised. I thought this would only be about 300 million worth of shorts that could get taken out because I wouldn't have thought that that people would actually be short um you know, following such a long period of reaccumulation at those lows. Um remember what we said yesterday, short-term, the summary of the video was short-term bullish, medium to high time frame bearish, which means we're coming into those resistance zones, which we'll talk about today. long to short ratio still balanced over here. Um so no real skew over there. Nothing to write home about."

Um so no real skew over there. Nothing to write home about. There's still some shorts in the market which you can see over here based on the uncertainty that's showing you that the funding rate is still uh it's balanced to slightly negative. Right? That's the the general area. We got the CPI that came out. Everything hit exactly as expected, but I think we have a few more things coming out today. Um let's have a quick look at that and we'll see what our trading calendar says. uh January the 14th, retail sales, existing home sales, and then tomorrow we got the initial jobless claims. Um and yeah, those are the main things to look out for. So CPI came out relatively decently as expected, but we'll see if they if they're faking the numbers, right? There's always a chance of that um in the future when that comes out that will probably have an effect on the market. Anyways, moving on. Market going positive on the deltas over here on High Block Capital. That is for BTC, ETH, and Salana. So your big three over there all positive which means um you know long if you were long before this great which of course we were we have all of our trades over there were long before the move which is all good and well but if you're longing now remember you're longing a little bit late after you've had these big liquidations. um you know the the some the most of the move has probably already happened at this point and you're now building up that liquidity still below price action over here uh sitting at about $89,000 as of right now. Now I wanted to see you know is this move real. Now one of the things we can look at to see is the move real or was it just purely driven by a short squeeze is we can have a look at the bottom line over here which is going to be your aggregate CBD spot accumulative volume delta for the spot that tells us hey you know what in this price move up were the actual real spot buyers that came in well actually if you have a look over here the spot buyers only jumped in at about $93,000. So you already had that first big candle up spot started to jump into the market and it was also accelerated by um you know some of those shorts getting taken out. Open interest building shorts came down they got flushed over there um and that bounced price towards the upside. So there is a little bit of spot buying but some of the move was also generated by those short squeeze or by the short squeeze which is why you had um in an illlquid market 600 million that got liquidated. Remember, by nature, when you close a short trade, what does that mean? When a short trade gets stopped out, it immediately flips into a market buy. Because if you market executing, um so you have your your limit order set over there to execute and then it says market sell when your stop gets taken. Uh that or market exit, it means you're going to be market buying and that accelerates the price towards the upside, which is all good and well. That means if you can reclaim some key levels and you can maintain those levels after a short squeeze, you can reposition the whole market back towards the upside. At the end of the day, we have our trades on the table, right? We have those long trades over here. We got Monero 130% up since taking that trade. We got our gold trade 27% up. Micro Strategy is a short trade at 206. We should probably check on that one very quickly. Uh we haven't looked at the stock market. We only looked at the medals."

Micro Strategy is a short trade at 206. We should probably check on that one very quickly. Uh we haven't looked at the stock market. We only looked at the medals. Let's shoot through quickly to Micro Strategy. So, of course, putting in a bit of a bounce. Remember, we covered 75% of that trade. We're waiting for the final bit um to finish. And um now we can just adjust those FIPS. So, how high can Micro Strategy relief rally, right? I think this can easily make it up. Like, that wouldn't surprise me. A move all the way up to about 257 is absolutely possible. Reallocate that 75% profit back into the short trade if and when we get to that level. Otherwise, just leave the remainder. Leave the remainder to just continue to bleed out. Right? That's the plan of action for for Micro Strategy specifically. Coinbase getting a little bit of a bouncy bounce off of that. Um this was previously a gap that occurred over here. So, you filled that gap. The gap came all the way from um the 13th of May. So, futures gap over there from the 13th of May 2025. You filled that, you hit that level, you started to bounce and you do have that parallel support, lower boundary trend line. So, that's in play over there. Uh, what else do we need to look at? The Apple short trade. We spoke about taking profits on that. We expecting this to bounce to a profit taking environment. We'll have a look at the NASDAQ trade. NASDAQ hasn't yet taken off, but I wouldn't I wouldn't lose too much sleep about this trade yet, right? Continue to hold this trade. It's more about the daily candles and where they closing. So you've had one, two, three candles. Three candles have now officially closed outside of that down sloping trend line, which is confirmation of the breakout. This should follow through, right? We should see a follow through over here. Very similar to what the S&P 500 has done. It's been grinding up higher highs and higher lows. The Dow Jones higher highs and higher lows. So I'm going to maintain that longing exposure over there. And a reminder, if you do want to copy that, uh the bot is still available, which for both uh Tesla, which is still in the zone, right? I want to remind you Tesla still mostly in the zone. QQQ, NASDAQ still in the zone. If you want to, you can copy those exact trades. I've attached both of the bots over there in the show description. Right? So, if you go to the link um in the description, you'll see Tesla NASDAQ first. You would need to sign up over there to Pinex if you do want to take that trade. And then remember part of the plan is to rotate some of those profits into these two trades. Specifically Tesla because it's got a bit more volatility and it's a very close clear easy invalidation. The closer you to your invalidation the better, right? NASDAQ not so clearcut. Um it's it's more of a catch-up trade that you're hoping is going to follow suit with the S&P 500 and and the Dow Jones, right? So um I know we're jumping back and forth over here, but let's continue. Other things I wanted to look at, Monero, right? Remember Monero, we spoke about a long time ago. A big shout out to Crypto James. Crypto James came and he actually posted over here the original trade setup. Um, I'm not going to play the whole video over here, but that was the initial trade setup over here that we're looking at. We're scaling into Monero with a stop loss at about $320 over there into this triangled area. And now, of course, we're trading in that $700 region. So, um, good stuff. Good stuff over there. Monero now um 55% higher over the last 30 days. Uh social mentions at a one-year high."

Monero now um 55% higher over the last 30 days. Uh social mentions at a one-year high. Trading volume up 350%. But most importantly, it is an old coin, right? Privacy, the narrative is still there and it's at an 8-year all-time high, which is absolutely huge. Remember, if you guys want additional alpha, go follow me um on the socials, right? It's also linked in the description below. uh both on um you can follow me on both Instagram and Twitter over there or X uh and and I do drop updates there as well. So, let's have a look at it. There's Monero almost hitting that final take profit. Big congratulations to all of you that took this trade. Now, you have a decision to make. Are you going to take the profit or are you just going to hold it for higher? Right? Because there is a chance that this thing absolutely melts through and continues much much higher. This was simply just the measured move that we had based off of the cup and handle formation and the exact target. So I started to TP a little bit before the target. If I just compress this. There we go. The exact target is $740.36. So sometimes I like to exit and front run that a little bit. One of the things we need to consider is how many days up have we had? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 right. It's very rare that you extend usually bel beyond 9 days which means today's day number seven maybe tomorrow then 8 which is Thursday and then by Friday I would start to become really cautious and consider at least shaving some of these profits. So, I think that it's probably worthwhile to A either remove your initials if it was a spot trade and you've doubled your money. Why not remove your initials? You have absolutely no risk in the trade. Or B, if you're in a leverage trade, mandatory, you have to move your stops to break even. And you got to take off. You got to pay yourself, guys, at least 33% in my opinion. At least 33%. You got to shave off at least one/ird of that trade to pay yourself. Otherwise, the risk-to-reward stuff is invalid. Right? If you can't if you never take profit on these things, it's invalid because it skews how much risk you actually putting into um these trades. If you never take that, you can't like back test and actually work out your profitability over time. All righty, moving on. So, let's get into the USDT dominance, which is rejecting off of this key level. Remember, we said that in my opinion, it's just a matter of when you come up into this higher target around 8%. Which means any of the bounces that you're getting right now is a gift for those of you that have been stuck in positions. Rethink your strategy. It's 2026. It's a fresh year. This could be your year, right? Don't do the same things over again and make the same mistakes. Consolidate your portfolio. Hold the winners and keep control. What do I mean by keep control? Don't hold a thousand coins. This is the craziest thing to do. Don't hold 100 coins. In my opinion, do not even hold 20 coins, right? Keep a handful. What how many things? How many fingers do you have on a hand? Right? You have five. So, a handful is like five. Of course, you can hold, this is a rule of thumb, you can hold six, seven. Just make sure you keep control of your positions and you understand exactly where your money is at. So, the expectation is that this could pull back down into this zone over here. How deep it goes, I don't know."

So, the expectation is that this could pull back down into this zone over here. How deep it goes, I don't know. But I expect that you would probably very quickly get a reaction like that back above the purple line on the USDT dominance. That means down to 5.354%. So whatever that gives you in an opposite and equal reaction into the rest of the market. So remember opposite reaction because this goes down the rest of the market goes up that becomes your selling opportunity where you can rebalance your positions, take profits on your long trades and enter into short trades. So, we're not at that level yet, but we're close. If we follow this trajectory by the end of February, which is next week, the relief rally is probably over. You're finding support over here. The highs start to print and then we're going to expect this move towards the upside. And that's where you need to be ultra careful. So, how high can these things go? We have to look at total 1, two, three, and then at Bitcoin. So, if we look at total one, well, I think that this would struggle to get above 3.51 trillion. That is going to be your 50% level. If the move gets really extreme, you know, this can run up about as high as 3.74. But all of this is complacency bounce territory where you probably want to tighten things. And you know what? If you're wrong or if I'm wrong, let's say, because I don't know what you guys think, but if I'm wrong and price doesn't reject from here, but you take profit over here, what is it going to cost you? a very small opportunity cost because you sell over here and you say you know what if you can maintain and hold above this level I will get long again that cost you almost nothing right your opportunity is only about 6%. Is it worth losing 6% opportunity cost versus losing all of your money because you decided to rather hold on to this and before you know it it's uh September October this year and we're trading all the way back down at these lows. Um of course it's not worth it, right? It's better to take some of those positions off the table and be ultra careful. So purple line 1.45 trillion on total two and then we got the golden pocket of 1.54. These are resistance zones. Total three 980 billion psychological round number of 1.04 trillion. So call it 1 trillion is coming in at the 0.618. uh if we look at the return on investment from cycle peak so meaning the draw down periods relative to the price cycles nothing is really out of the norm there's no insane divergence over here so if we zoom in we are following the purple one right so you can see in the previous cycles green one is 2022 bare market into 2023 the orange one flashing on and off the screen that was your 2018 2019 bare market you had this period Right? You had this period over here. Most specifically, it was between about day number 100 to 115 since the peak where you started to put in a little bit of a rally, get people excited again to later only flush them down further. So, just be careful that doesn't happen to you because this is big resistance. It was one of our targets. We said as these key moving averages want to cross, this is the 21 EMA and the 50 EMA on the weekly time frame."

We said as these key moving averages want to cross, this is the 21 EMA and the 50 EMA on the weekly time frame. as those want to cross the intersection point oftent times becomes a magnet that sucks price into it and in the price cycle we actually traded above these levels right to then later fade and drop down so I am open to this even going higher right maybe even up as high as about $108,000 uh which I'll show you on some of the other charts but it can it sustain there that's the question so I wouldn't FOMO in even if it did this I would need to see those EMAs start to to reposition back up. So angled needs to be up and then I would probably wait for a throwback into there. And then I would say, okay, you know what? Maybe it's the 2026 um super cycle. We're following the 5year business cycle, which I don't think so, but maybe we are. And I'm wrong and I'll get long again, right? On on spot. I mean, uh for now, this should be treated as resistance because we still downtrending. And this is what previously happened, right? Just highlighting it on the screen for you. your super guppy indicator on the weekly time frame has turned gray and it's the first time in the entire cycle that we've seen that uh you can see red to gray to green positions all the way up and then you typically go gray to red by the time you're in red it's too late and the bare market lows are basically already almost in so are we doing something similar to this in this environment right that's a possibility be aware of that be aware of that uh we spoke about this as well price pulling into the middle bowling Ballinger band while volatility recontracts prints out blue verticals and the Ballinger bands squeeze in to reposition for the next big move. Right, that's all taking place. Uh we have come exactly into the volume points of control. We did get a beautiful volume spike but will we get follow through? If we if price repositions higher over here and starts to recapture 100K and the volume begins to pick up, we can re-evaluate. But for now, treat it as major major resistance with the potential of a bare flag. um still possibly in play over here. So, we got the big move up. We drew this out yesterday. I think we we mentioned this trade either yesterday or the day before. No, it was the day before yesterday. So, it was on Monday. We gave this trade setup over here. It has started to cloud. If you took this trade, we took another one on ETH. I'll bring that up as well in a moment. If you took this trade at this point, I would already take 25% profits. 25% profit. Stop break even. You can't lose. You've paid yourself. Um, and you know, we could see this possibly rallying up towards about 103,400. But as the the title says, how high can BTC go on this current rally? And will alts follow? I guess alts will follow because people believe it's all back. Um, some of the alts will follow and some of them are already, you know, um, extending well beyond what Bitcoin has provided in terms of gains like Monero, which we got that trade, right? We nailed that trade. We we also took the E trade which I'll go to in a moment. But what I'd be looking for is resistance over here. And whatever Bitcoin does, expect the altcoins to do the same thing. So probable resistance between 99,600 and up to about 103,400. That's like the base case area, the base case area for major resistance over there. And then also don't forget that um you know very very very soon and we said this the excitement into the bare moon."

That's like the base case area, the base case area for major resistance over there. And then also don't forget that um you know very very very soon and we said this the excitement into the bare moon. So, let's quickly measure measure that out. The bare moon and we'll we'll throw in our vertical line over there so you guys have it on your charts. Um, on the on Sunday, okay, Sunday bare moon rallies into resistance, hits the bare moon and down we go again after that. Probable, right? Very, very, very probable that that's going to happen. Uh, next. So, it looks something like this. We spoke about this yesterday as well. The rally up into this resistance area. This is your order block. This is going to be a big level that uh bulls will want to reclaim, right? That's the level that you need to see price get back above. Your momentum oscillator is still trending up, which was part of the reason why we mentioned those long trades and why you could continue to hold them. So, uh now let's go on to the Ethereum trade. So, Ethereum also playing out beautifully. What you need to do now, eliminate your risk stops to break even. You can pay yourself here as well. In my opinion, I do think that this will probably meet the final target. So, it's going to run up to about 3,600. Um, and therefore, you can take a bit of profit, maybe like 20% off the table over here. So, I have this trade as well on the table. This is a conservative target. Can things get crazier? Of course, this can rally all the way up back to 4K, but one step at a time. One step at a time over there. Um, all righty. Let's give a a big shout out over here to Melon Dial Jandro 6236. Quite a mouthful over there. They just got their first Bitfunded payout of $8,400. Well done. Congratulations. Uh remember guys, do we have our Bitfunded in the description below over here? We do. There's a Bitfunded link in the description. A lot of people are um you know opting to decrease their risk by rather taking challenges because your your downside is limited. It's capped. It's the price that you paid for the challenge. So if you blow your account, you lose the funding uh or not the funding but the the price that you paid for the funded account which is um let's click on it, right? We'll click on over here and I can show you quickly. So a lot of people are doing this. So you can sign up. You can sign up over there. There's a link in the description below. Um, oh, I'm not on the on the price page, but the the challenges are around $100. You can get a $10,000 challenge. Okay, so it's linked in the description below for those of you who want to get involved. Okay, Pippen. Let's go over Pippen because the rest of the market is moving up. Pippen is not yet moving up. This is probably a good thing for the short trade that we had set up over here. This is not the picture perfect, absolutely crystal clear, ideal entry to be precise. It's not, but it's the best that we could work with to try and get into that trade. So, the Pippen trade is still on. Um, you know, if you start to trade back above, so another 16% upside move. I'll have to close this trade over here. The real ideal stop loss is honestly over there, but that's too high, right? It's 36% away from current price. So, we'll see. Hopefully, we get a bit of a breakdown. If you can break that trend line down, um, you know, you're in the money and you can start to move stops to break even and this thing should move down. Um, okay. Any new trades? We're going to have a look. We're going to have a look."

Um, okay. Any new trades? We're going to have a look. We're going to have a look. There are already still new trades, right? The the trades that you can take is going to be uh NASDAQ as well as uh Tesla, which is also linked in the description if you want to just copy that bot. Um, what about the metals? Let me just quickly go to that based on that question. Uh, very quick look at that. How much had platinum moved? I guess you could you could move into platinum and rather just trail your stop loss under under um not Wednesday but Tuesday's low. So if you miss platinum, you could probably do that. You could probably take that trade stop loss below Tuesday's low because um you know this thing should go it should start to go now. Like we we shouldn't come back down near any of those levels. I'd want to see platinum start to accelerate over here. So yeah, there's an opportunity over there for you as well. um on platinum. Let's have a look at a couple of the others. We'll see if we can spot anything else today. Um but I'm really trying to keep like the book super tight and clean in terms of of what I'm entering into because I have to practice what I preach, which is I told you don't hold too many coins. Um yeah, one thing, let me quickly go over here. Do I have uh oil? Yes, we have to have a look at oil. What's going on on oil over here? Because I think that there has been a little bit of movement. Okay, you still got this this um falling uh parallel channel over here, but I guess you have a little bit of a trend as well that started to break over here on a low time frame. So maybe oil will start to move. No real trade over there for me. Um yeah. Okay, we we'll stick with those. Look, I don't want to bore you guys. People typically find the medals quite boring, but um we've given you enough, right? We've given you a few trades over there. So back on to crypto on the dailies. Still for me, Salon is in no man's land. It's going to be very similar to Bitcoin. You can trail that um and expect major resistance between 169 and 185. I think it will really struggle to get above 185. So, anything that occurs over here um is, you know, a relief rally bounce zone where you need to be careful that this isn't going to come all the way back down, which is what I would expect this level to get tagged at some point around 100. Um Sumi still struggling, right? This is what I mean. The the altcoins are still in struggle street. There's not much that's changed over here. Look at Sonic. It's not great. Say also not great. Cardano had a little bit of a bounce, technical bounce off of this key level, but following such a strong downtrend. These things never do this, right? It it's it's an absolute one in a million anomaly to see something come down this hard and then do this. It's just not going to happen. Like what's going to happen following a move down like that is a range probably into that underside resistance and then Cardano is probably going to do something like that. That's just to give you context for any coin, right? I'm not picking on on the Cardano hodlers. Um I'm just telling you how it is, right? That's what typically happens following those big sell-offs like this. Look at this big sell- off. Do you just go straight to the moon? Never. You range for a very very very long time. This is to give you context. How long is this?"

This is to give you context. How long is this? So that range before you put in your next move was 749 days before you put in relief, proper relief. That's a very long time. That's uh like over two years. So don't expect miracles over here. Um AVAC, same thing. It sucks. It's under um previous support now flipped into resistance. Ton, nothing going on over there. Casper, honestly, nothing going on. I expect this to actually bleed out further. Um, Tron. This is a good one to keep an eye on for a short trade. Okay, so we got to put this one on the watch list. We got to look out for a short trade on on Tron. Let's mark out some levels cuz we had the perfect setup and plan for the previous short trade and then we missed it or I missed it, I should say. Um, so we're going to keep an eye on Tron. We think Tron is going to go down. So, let's look at some of these levels. I feel like you probably have um Yeah, there is. I was looking if there's a bit of a parallel channel forming. So yeah, main area is coming up very very very soon. I would expect this to fail within the circle which is soon. It's pretty much right here. It already could be done. Percentage wise um that is one more second. Let me just get it exact. Percentage wise we're looking at about you know two to about 6% 2 to 6% higher. So, you also got this trend forming. So, monitor this trend. You can monitor those high highs and high lows. Okay, we're on the 4hourly, right? High low, high, low, high, low, high, low, and it just keeps going high, low, high, low, high, low, high, low. Basically, just wait for that to get taken out. So, for example, let's say we print a high, low here, bounces up, and then we take that out. There you go. You take that level out, bounce up because it's hit our circled area. It's hit the circled area. This opens up a short trade. Huge pent up liquidity over here and continuation with a broader higher time frame trend. That's what I'd be looking at. So Tron is on the watch list for potential short trade. Um add it on your own one as well and um execute. Okay, let me check the comments, guys. What else have we got? Uh let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Also, oh, we doing a giveaway. I forgot about it. We're doing a giveaway. So, smash the like button. I'm going to [clears throat] be giving away $1,000 on today's show and then tomorrow I'll do the same thing. But remember to be eligible, the only way that you are eligible was if you signed up to Bit Unix, right? So everything was linked in the description. Go and smash the like button over there. Um and then Bit Unix is over here. This is limited to the first 1,000 people. So you're going to see today how easy it is to win $1,000. Now, my question to you is, do you want the money divided up where it's like the people that signed up yesterday, you guaranteed to win? You're just only going to get about $100 each, unfortunately. Or do we just do do a giveaway to everyone? So, if you want equal split, put number one in the chat. If you want everyone I mean uh so if you want everyone to win, put a one in the chat. If you want one winner, put a two in the chat. Okay? So, give me a one or two. If you want one winner, put a two in the chat and then um I'm going to do the giveaway as well."

Okay, hardest, let me know what the the chat numbers come out like. You can pop them up on the screen over there. A one or a two. And while we wait for the feed to come through, um I'm just going to continue on over here. So, we'll have a look at a few more things. And we're about to do the giveaway. Right. Um I wanted to mention ZK Sync, right? ZK sync is one of the uh projects with a lot of promise that is delivering on their road maps. So I actually had a look over here at their road maps. There it is 2025 road map. They delivered on everything. Simplifying the developer experience enabling web to like user experience connecting public and private chains. Now their new um road map is big. Here's their new road map, right? They're solving privacy and control problems for institutions uh in absolutely the perfect way in my opinion with ZK proofs. So 2026, let's see if the floodgates open, they could potentially bring trillions and trillions of dollars into the market. Um and yeah, they're doing big money things, right? So if you have a look over here, if you want to look at their road map, if you want more information on exactly what they're doing, go and follow Alex ZK Sync over there. Gluck 64. Gluck 64 has dropped the full road map over here exactly what they're doing. But what's more important is um you'll remember that Polygon is one of their competitors who is valued significantly significantly higher. So if you are looking for infrastructure bets and plays based on what their fully diluted valuation is, they are grossly grossly undervalued. If you're a value investor and you believe that these things always move back to fair value, this is extremely undervalued and they're nailing all of their road maps. Okay. So, Hardis, show me in in the background. I can see your fingers. What is it? Are we doing a split giveaway? Split giveaway is what most people want. Okay. All right. So, you guys didn't want to um you know, roll the dice to potentially win everything. So, we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine people. So, what I'll do, because this guy deposited $5,685, we're going to give him $200 and the rest of you 100. Okay, there you go. You all get $100. It's like the Oprah Winfrey show. You all get $100. Just look under your seat. There we go. $100. $100. You're all over 100 bucks. And this is 200. Let's just double check that. I didn't go over a,000. That's perfect. That's a,000. These are your user ID numbers for those of you who joined yesterday. You can see the 13th of January. Congratulations. Um, it will be sent into your wallet. Just give it like 48 hours. Give it 48 hours before you start sending messages and things like that. If you want to be in tomorrow's draw, you can see that I did prep the generator tool. Let's see what would have happened. who would have won all of it if you guys opted for the spin. The spin, right? Number 23. Sell number 23. This guy would have won $1,000. So, if if you opted for that, that guy would have won $1,000. So, I'll keep this spinner over here, the generator tool for tomorrow. If you want to be in tomorrow's um you know, spin uh to win, I don't know, what are we going to call this thing? $1,000 spin to win, then just make sure that you join Bit Unix. That's all you have to do. And make a deposit. You're only eligible if you make a deposit into the account. I recommend depositing at least $400."

Yes, the wheel of fortune. Okay, so we're going to call it the wheel of fortune. If you want to be in the $1,000 giveaway for the Wheel of Fortune for tomorrow, you know what to do. Bit Unix is listed in the link in the description below. All righty. So, that is it from me, guys. I will see all of you on the next one. Um, happy hunting for today. I gave you a few more trade ideas. Let's let the market continue to do its thing and we'll just be positioned. I'll see you all tomorrow. Have a good day and cheers for now."
