      "text": "Okay, guys. What's going on? It is Lewis here. Let me know if you can uh let me know if you could see me, if you could hear me, if everything is a okay so that I can make sure that uh you know it's going good and then we will jump right into it. Good idea. Good idea. Let me check if my mouse is charged real quick. Um, yeah. All right. I'm at 50. Uh, I'm at 58%. And by the way, I use a trackpad. I use a trackpad, not even a mouse. Um, awesome. Glad to see I'm alive and well on your end. Make myself a little bit bigger. So today, um, you know, this is all about trading bare markets, you know, um, pretty much what we're in right now. So, I figured it would be probably a good idea to go over and let me do this. Let me let me save this real quick. Uh, just to make sure that it is good. I yeah, I just figured it would be a good idea to go over um you know, how to trade bare markets and how to navigate what's currently happening because uh most people just don't know, you know. Um most people just lose money, right? I mean, I I I don't think it goes too much without saying that uh most people have lost money uh over the last few months, right? I want to see if I can make my make this a little not even a little bit, make this like a lot bigger to be honest though, just because um you know I want you guys to be able to see the chart. So I'm going to make this chart a bit bigger and see if I could do that. So I'm going to throw this over here. I'm going to put my head down here in the corner and I'll and I'll lower it down a little bit and then I will click save. Okay. 222 update. Awesome. Um, okay. So, double check. I'm I want it to be, you know, I want you guys to see this. I wrote down everything that we're going to do. And I'm going to do this. And I'm going to zoom in a little bit more. All right. So, now that now that it's good, now that it's um you know, a little bit bigger. Yeah, of course we're in a bare market, man. Uh oh, Poland. Yo, Poland. I want to freaking That's where I want to go. Um actually, that's literally like my most um like the place where I want to go most is is actually Poland. So, props up to you. Lucky lucky you. Um, so yeah, let's get into this. Um, as you know what, these live streams are more so it's not that they're off the cuff, but it's more because obviously you can see I did prepare for this. Um, but it is, you know, I don't need I don't necessarily need slides for it, right? I could just I could I could just do it. I mean, I've been trading for how long now? You know, like nine years. So, this is what we're going to do. We're going to be going over identifying bull markets and bare markets. We're going to be going over identifying when bare markets, you know, when a bare market is likely to happen. We're going to be going over how to trade both the markets and what to do if you're trading. So, um well, no, I do love I do love my PowerPoint. Right. So now that we have this um you know basically plotted out, let me get rid of that and maybe make a little bigger. So there's a lot of things to know and this is going to be part of my series of like um essentially you know that I've been going over uh trading 101. If you were looking at my last live, you would have noticed that I talked a lot about market cycles. Um I talked a lot about the fear and greed chart. I talked a lot lot about like market timing and big picture stuff and then also I went really deep and not really but like pretty deep into risk management because all of those things are really really important. They're sort of like not just sort of they they're basically part of the foundation of crypto right of of trading anything."

They're sort of like not just sort of they they're basically part of the foundation of crypto right of of trading anything. So uh basically basically what we have to do in order to identify bull versus bare markets is look at these things time frame time frames higher highs and higher lows consolidation um to a breakup long time frame uptrend trend line and price break above EMA. So I'll just go through those really quickly. Let's you know understand the time frame when I talk about time frame of bare market versus bull market what I'm talking about specifically in that case is when we enter a bull market how long do you think a bull market I you know is supposed to last or could last or should last right so that's the first thing that you should be thinking of because if we're just entering a bull market and it's like three weeks into a bull market then you have a very long time you know you have a lot a lot longer of a time frame to get in you know cuz it lasts you know a few years right it'll usually last three years at least for crypto uh for the bull markets and this let's just say 20 December 2022 to let's say uh October 2025 you know 2022 to 2023 2023 to 2024 2024 to 2025 is three years, right? That's typically So, Bitcoin usually has a three-year cycle, right? Where it goes in an uptrend. So, the first thing to think about when you're thinking, okay, are we in a bull market? Are we in a bare market? Is the time frame because there are certain things that you will also look at objectively uh with data. But if the time frame isn't uh doesn't add up, then you know, you have to use your brain at that point and use judgments. I'm talking specifically right here. Specifically right here. Um, this could have potentially been, you know, a bare market based off of price action. You know, making lower lows and lower highs. And same thing with right here. Lower low, lower high, lower low, right? But we weren't close in terms of the time span the time frame of a normal bull market uh for the for me to even consider that this is you know a bearish like we're entering a bare market here right but when we when we got to be up here and especially on Ethereum uh which was right here like like this was around the time where it was close enough to getting to be the uh end of where the bull market most likely will be. You know, this is getting close enough to be like, okay, look, it was 3 years of a bull market and now we have all of these other things like uh the price action going in a down trend lining up. So now I know, okay, I want to be more bearish, right? So, uh, Dan, yeah, Dan, I mean, the monthly Ballinger band. Okay, let's if you use Here's the thing. Uh, I don't know if that's his I doubt that's his only criteria, right? But um if you use only the monthly Ballinger band as uh designated of a downtrend, you know, a bare market, then that's automatically you're automatically not going to get out, you know, anywhere close to the top. uh to be honest. Um because Ballinger bands and moving averages and a lot almost every single um indicator that you that that chartists use, they're lagging. They're lagging indicators. So, they're not going to happen until the price already goes down or goes up, whether it's bearish or bullish, right? And that's why you should always look at the price action first. Okay?"

So, they're not going to happen until the price already goes down or goes up, whether it's bearish or bullish, right? And that's why you should always look at the price action first. Okay? Always, always, always look at the price action first because to be honest, I you know, I could tell it was a bare market in like literally the week of like like the very second it happened like I knew it was a bare market um because of what I'm about to teach you and what I'm about to share. So essentially the time frames is the first thing to understand think about. Okay. The second thing is to really just use the common sense. Higher highs and higher lows make up a bull market. And so there's also consolidation and a breakup. So we'll go over those two right now. Higher highs and higher lows. Consolidation a breakup. What happened during the bull market? This entire bull market. Well, we had, let me go over here. Actually, I'll I'll draw it out. So, we had a low, higher high, or sorry, high, low, higher high, higher low, higher high. Um, higher low, higher high, equal low. Um, but still fine. Higher high, higher low, higher high, higher low. And now, here is where I was talking about where, okay, technically speaking, this made a lower low, right? This made a lower low, lower high, and eventually another lower low or equal low if you want to call it that. But regardless, it's in a downtrend that during this time, right? But you you can't say, \"Oh, hey, we're in a bare market now just based off of this because it it was only a few it was only a year um you know, a a little bit more than a year into the bull market when this happened. So to think that this is, you know, we've entered a bare market just because now we have lower lows and lower highs on the higher time frame, uh, when it's only been a year into what should be a three-year bull market. Like that is where discernment has to come in. Okay. Um, but when we're in a bull market, we're making higher highs and higher lows. And then the other thing is that when we have a consolidation, we break upward. And it was very very easy to to see that basically I mean every every time we every time we had a consolidation like look at this consolidation right and then and then a move upward consolidation right here boom ba boom move upward same thing right here uh consolidation move upward right so and you could even say you know even though this was technically a downtrend consolidation moving upward right that's a bull market right this is all bull market stuff. So, let's just go back real quickly to to over here. The last thing that I have for bull market, what makes a bull market long long time uptrend trend line and also price above EMA, right? Um, so let's see if we could actually do this. Uh, long time time frame uptrend. Okay, so essentially, yeah. Okay. So, we could do this for the long, you know, it's a it's a trend line that the price continually bounced off of all the way up until here where, you know, now we're in a bare market, right? So, this right here, the fact that it kept on bouncing off of this trend line, this upward trend line, is another signifier that we're in a bull market. Right? Now that we're below it, that's obviously really indicative that we're in a bare market now. So now that you understand how to identify a bull market, how can you identify when a bare market is likely? Well, uh first off, the lower high and lower low on the higher time frame. Okay, so that's what I talked about earlier, right?"

So now that you understand how to identify a bull market, how can you identify when a bare market is likely? Well, uh first off, the lower high and lower low on the higher time frame. Okay, so that's what I talked about earlier, right? uh in this in this section right here how we had the lower low and the lower highs except here um it didn't you know you had to use discernment in the fact that the time frame wasn't long enough. However, if you look you know obviously here we made a high we made a uh a lower high and now a lower low. Okay. And this happened in the time frame of where the bare market should technically start. That makes a lot more sense. Right? So now we're making higher highs and uh sorry lower highs and lower lows. And on the daily it's obvious it's much more it's much more obvious on the daily time frame um we're in a downtrend. Right? So that's number one. Number two is the same thing as consolidation except instead of moving up after the consolidation, we move down after the consolidation. And then and also the break below the long-term trend line which I mentioned before. And there's now a downward resistance trend line. So before you know I was saying consolidation move up, consolidation move up, consolidation move up. That's that's what happens in bull markets. In bare markets, we haven't actually seen one on the weekly time frame yet. Uh but in bare markets, like this bare market right here, you could say consolidation down. Okay. and then consolidation fake breakout down consolidation this whole thing essentially down right so and this is the higher time frame so it's um definitely I mean it's easier to see but and there's not as many but you see a lot more on the lower time frames but that's what happens consolidation down consolidation down consolidation down so just using this sorry to you know be the bearer of bad news. But just using this, if this is some form of consolidation, what's probably likely to happen is another move down because if if we, you know, are making lower lows and lower if number one, the the amount of time has passed, okay, that warrants that we're in a bare market. If number two, we're making lower lows and lower highs. If number three, we've broken below the long-term trend line. Okay, if all of those things are are are happening, then what else what else do you need, you know, to make it look like we're in a bare market or to or to or or to understand or to believe that we're in a bare market, you know? Um it doesn't make sense that why why people would think that we're in a bull market. And so there's all of these things, right? And um since we have all of that, well, how do you trade it? because everyone always everyone always makes, you know, money in the bull market, but no one makes money in the in the bare market. And so, essentially, uh, let's go over that, you know, let's go over how to actually trade this because it's it's freaking tough, right? And, uh, the first thing that I want to say is no matter whether it's a bull market or a bare market, you have to trade off of data, right? You have to use data. Um, give me one second. I'm going to read the and I'm going to read the read the comments real quick and then I'm going to do this. So, can you give your thoughts on the use of Elliot waves as part of an overall strategy of the probabilities of price action and where price will bounce and change direction? Uh, or are they less useful in crypto than traditional market? I you do use Elliot Elliot waves. Um, so I use Elliot waves to I use basically um the five waves and ABCs uh corrections."

Uh, or are they less useful in crypto than traditional market? I you do use Elliot Elliot waves. Um, so I use Elliot waves to I use basically um the five waves and ABCs uh corrections. So, for me, the way that I use it is uh when it comes to Elliot waves and and first off, always start with the price action first. Always start with the candlestick first and then build on top of that, you know. Um, but for me, what and Elliot waves are for everyone who uh doesn't, you know, know about know about Elliot waves, I'll just explain it real quickly. Typically, there is either five waves. So, actually, wait a minute. There's literally a thing. uh one, two, three, four, five. Five waves up and then there is a correction called usually an A B C. Okay. And get out of here. Uh like this. So five waves up, three waves down. That's that's you know the big picture type stuff. And then um that's in bull markets. And in bare markets, if I can move this to the right. Why does this not move over to the right? Am I too? Uh there you go. So in that's in bull markets and in bare markets uh what I've seen is that a lot of times it's you know one two three four five moves down and then the corrective moves are are are moves up like ABC and then and then back to back to five moves down after that. Um so I have noticed that they do uh you know LA waves do do work uh very very very well and I've used them multiple multiple times and a a really cool thing to do actually is uh used Elliot waves in fact in fact Elliot waves if I go back to Bitcoin I'm I'm pretty Elliot waves was one of the reasons why I was pretty sure it was a bare market um one two three, four, five. Like if you look right here, uh let's like one, two, three, four. This is like five waves up, like a clear like a clear five waves up pattern, right? Um, so you get five waves up and and and at the five waves up you get these you get this bearish super bearish you know candle the both of them these two long wick bearish candles at the top after a huge uptrend after five waves up man things alarm bells have to start going off at that point right like seriously um so yeah Elliot waves I love them I love Elliot waves and and I use it. And the other thing is that if you go down into um I'll give you a little bit of sauce here is that on the lower time frames a lot of the times I don't know I have no idea if this if this works here but if we're in a bull market uh three four five uh sometimes what you could do let's see let's see if this works um I don't know whether to use it here here I think it would be from here one two let's just let's just call it this um if you take the fib if you use Elliot waves along with fibs usually the 61.8 is where we get the bounce from. Although I mean it's always the 61.8 as like like you know um but if you could get it somewhere in this value zone uh and it lines up with the high of the two it's it honestly thinking about this this is all this is literally all the same thing as as order blocks and uh just normal Fibonacci and and everything else. Um, but typically if you get five waves up, you could take the Fibonacci from the bottom to the top from the from the very bottom to to the top uh one to five and then you could get the 61.8 of that and that's usually where it will rebound."

Um or if you're a shorter term trader, you could take the um a lot of the times you could take the the Fibonacci of the first wave and uh basically get in at the at the 38.2. Um and you could know if it's more bullish or bearish based off of if if it bounces off the 38.2 or if it goes below the 61.8. But I'm getting way too ahead of myself. We need to go back to the bare markets, trading in bare markets because that's what this is. That's what this stream is supposed to be about, right? So, I already told you how to identify bull markets. I already told you how to identify bare markets. So, uh how to actually trade bare markets or how to trade both markets. What I was talking to, uh what I was saying before we got to the data was that sorry, before I got to the Elliot waves was that you have to use data, right? It doesn't matter what you do, you have to use data. And I talked about this in my first stream. So, go back to my first stream if you if you haven't watched it and understand that that no matter what you're trading, you have to have data of what you're trading. You have to have data of your uh trade setups, of your strategy. You have to have a strategy. If you don't have a strategy, then don't trade. It's very simple, right? So, you can you can as long as you have a strategy or you're testing your strategies, then that's what you want to do. um whether you're whether you're in in a bull market or a bare market, no matter what you're trading, because if you don't, then you're essentially going in blind, you know, regardless. But let's go over some specific examples or specific things of of what to do during bare markets. Uh the first one is obvious. Don't try to time the bottom, right? Don't don't try to just say, \"Okay, like here's the bottom. Here's the bottom. Here's the bottom. I'm not going to You don't try to time the bottom.\" What to do instead is to create a plan, okay, of where you think the bottom will be. Plot things plot things out such as levels, right? And it's not just one line. A lot of people, they'll just plot one line like like let's say they plot this line out right here and they say, \"Okay, I'm going to buy it at this line no matter what.\" That's not necessarily what you want to do. What you what's a better situation, what's a better play is to draw a box. draw a box at the area where you think that it might bottom and then put some alerts in and then when the price does come down into that area, you could go into the lower time frames and you could look for trade setups and then you could actually start to, you know, buy it and trade it based off of the trade setup such as this that happens within this area, right? That's going to be a lot better than just simply blindly buying at whatever area you think. Let's say you blindly buy right here. And I'll make this white. What if this happens? What if it what if this happens? Like literally it comes down here, you bought it, it goes up, it goes up, it goes up, and then, you know, let's just say it comes back down and it crashes back through that again. You know, are you simply holding or are you going to be managing your position? or if you blindly buy and it literally just crashes right through, you know, and it just crashes right through."

You know, are you simply holding or are you going to be managing your position? or if you blindly buy and it literally just crashes right through, you know, and it just crashes right through. So, it that's why it's better um in my opinion to have a box and to go into the lower time frames after it actually hits and then you will, you know, be able to uh get enter that way. But that's about not timing bottoms. The other thing I want to say about timing uh timing bottoms or not um is that if something does come down enough and you know and you believe in the fundamentals of it then I would say okay it's fine to be a bottom buyer it's fine to buy and just throw your stack in because you know for example for Bitcoin right let's say that you thought the bottom was going to be, I don't know, right here, uh, let's say 27,000, okay? And you ended up full stacking in at 27,000. If you have a long enough time horizon, then, you know, that's going to be fine. So, for instance, some people might have the buy orders set at 60 69,000, right? Because it lines up with the previous all-time highs. And it's like, okay, they could buy it at 69,000 and then maybe the price continues to drop all the way down, but if your time horizon is long enough, then it's this is going to be most likely a amazing buying opportunity at $69,000, right? Even if it does end up going down to say like $40,000 or something like that. Um, so you have to have a game plan. That's the other thing. It's all about having a game plan because you can, you know, I say, like I say, don't buy, don't be a bottom buyer, right? But you can essentially do that as long as you're okay and you have an understanding of what might happen, right? If you don't want to take the risk of having that of having the price continue to go down, then what you could do is you could continue to wait for the price action to tell you and give you clues that it's actually, you know, bottoming out and that it's actually, you know, moving up and now we're back in a bull market and then you could get in. Okay, it's really up to you. It's everyone has different trading strategies, right? Um, but one other thing that you could do in a bare market is tax loss harvesting. Okay, so let's say you've been buying not even Salana. Let's go to like, I don't know, useless. And let's just say that you were buying this all, you know, this cycle and now it's all the way down here. Um, you could actually sell it and then buy something else. I'm not sure exactly how um, you know, when this is going to change, but and of course, none of this is financial advice. always talk to your accountant and you know your professionals uh with this but from what I've heard you can sell at a loss at a major loss and then you could buy back uh your crypto in certain jurisdictions in on in certain countries literally the same day and uh you could lock in those losses and use them as tax loss harvesting which is amazing. So that's something that you could do in a bare market. Okay. The other thing is that you don't have to actually even be trading, you know, you could just have cash. Just stay in cash, you know, because no position is a position. And then if you do that, you know, you could just go out and touch crash essentially. I mean, if you think that Bitcoin's gonna, you know, go down to $50,000 or $69,000, you could essentially sell it and then just like walk away and not do anything and save yourself a whole bunch of headaches, right? So, you could do that."

So, you could do that. You could uh sell out sell sell all of your stuff and then just like wait and walk away, set alerts at different levels or just sell all your stuff and just keep on watching it and just have the patience because the time to FOMO is during bull markets, right? That's the time to FOMO. Uh the time in bare markets, you almost want to FOMO out of bare markets, right? Uh because it's so it could go down so quickly. Obviously, it could go up so quickly in bull markets, too, which is why FOMOing in in bull markets could be okay sometimes. But like, no, if we're in a bare market, there's no need to rush. There's no need to to go in like I remember during the bull market, I would see a trade setup or no, I would like see a something fundamental. I would see a coin that I like that I was like, \"Oh, this looks good. Let me I'm going to buy it.\" But it would be like 2:00 in the morning, so I would go to sleep and I would say, \"I'm going to buy it tomorrow.\" And I would wake up and the next day it's up 200%. Right? But that doesn't happen in bare market. That very very rarely happens to anything in bare markets. Most things go down in bare markets. So why why would you try to rush? You know, you don't need to rush anything. Bare markets, you could slow down, you could touch some grass, you could uh you know, basically do whatever you want to do in a bare market. Um, but like it would be pretty stupid to to be trying to jump in, you know, and long during bare markets. And that's another actually that's uh uh another thing which is that uh I guess two other things. We'll go to the next one number five which is that you know what crypto sucks right now. It's right now it crypto is super hard. It's really difficult to trade crypto. Why is that? Well, it's because everything freaking goes down. You know, everything's been going down and uh it's been super tough to trade it. But you know what hasn't been going down? heavy metals and commodities and other metals and uh nuclear things and and energy and all of these other all of these other asset classes. So why you know you know you don't have to you don't have to trade just the one thing that you you know are accustomed to and this is what I learned last this is what I learned in I learned this in 2017 sorry 2018 because in 2018 I was all in crypto I had 100% of my net worth was in crypto and then I lost 90% of it Um, but at the same time there were weed stocks that were going absolutely crazy and there were other stocks in the stock market that were going bananas and you know that's that's what you could you could go into those things and actually I just saw today that just just literally hours ago apparently and um has put a like over 150 stocks and metals and commodities of these and other things on uh the Salana blockchain. So maybe you could actually trade all of these different assets uh potentially through a hot w potentially through like I don't know a a Phantom wallet or Jupiter maybe Jupiter something like that. Um I have I haven't checked it out entirely but yeah I mean it's they're tokenizing all of these different assets which is really really cool. So that's the thing. You don't have to stick with with crypto. I stuck with crypto all throughout 2018 and all throughout 2019 and all throughout 2020. And it was really horrible."

You don't have to stick with with crypto. I stuck with crypto all throughout 2018 and all throughout 2019 and all throughout 2020. And it was really horrible. It was a horrible experience. Obviously, I used that time to learn how to trade and to master, you know, my craft and master trading. But like but like now that I know how to trade and honestly even though I didn't know how to trade uh back then, I was learning it. Um I should I it would have been easier just going into other markets that were already doing very very well. And so that's what a lot of people are doing right now. Uh and that's that honestly that's what I'm doing also as well. If you watch the uh Monday stream a lot of times I say like look I don't have a position. I don't see any good setups. I'm waiting. I'm waiting. I'm waiting. And um I'm waiting in crypto for a lot of good things to happen. But like in in I'm I'm trying to put as much as I can into into like these energy companies and stuff like that. So yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of momentum outside, you know, in these other places. So that's one thing that you could do or if you um are wanting to stick with crypto, you you have to adjust your strategy. So right now only the very very very short term like scalping uh is is is working, right? Like of course we're consolidating and then we're having these like sharp moves up and down but like it's like tricking people and faking people out and it's really really tough. So on the longer time frames on the higher time frames, you know, it's it's sort of tough. But on the shorter time frames, there's always, you know, there's always going to be a trade set up on like, you know, the 1 hour, the 15 minute, stuff like that. So if you want to trade those time frames, that's another thing that you could do. Um, and going back to going back to the, you know, the list of how to actually, you know, how to trade in the bare markets, there's a couple things. So, first off, use data. Whether we're in an uptrending bull market or downtrending bare market, make sure you have a strategy. Make sure you make sure you back tested and forward tested and you know what you're doing and you know your win rate and you know how good the um you know the trade are that you're doing the strategy is that you're doing how understand R understand risk management understand all this stuff right then also don't try to time the bottoms because you never know if it's going to keep on going down or not um if you're wrong also cut it early just cut it if you try to time the bottom and then and you realize you're wrong okay just just like get out and then you could get back in when things look better. It's not, you know, take a small loss like literally actually actually sometimes losing, you know, like like taking the loss and losing the money is a good thing. It's a good strategy because if you don't actually materialize the losses, it's going to become even more, you know, especially in a market that's just continuing to go down, right? So, that's another thing uh when it comes to bare markets. Now, I will say this though, like I talked about long-term long-term horizon, right? Long-term time horizon of what you have. For instance, let's say that you do believe Bitcoin is going to be, you know, the world currency or you believe Bitcoin is going to be a million dollars per Bitcoin or whatever. Well, now is actually the best time to be dollar cost averaging into it."

For instance, let's say that you do believe Bitcoin is going to be, you know, the world currency or you believe Bitcoin is going to be a million dollars per Bitcoin or whatever. Well, now is actually the best time to be dollar cost averaging into it. Everyone always says like dollar cost average, dollar cost average, dollar cost average and they always talk about it during the bull market especially, but that honestly is actually legitimately technically uh I don't know what other word to say data anal analytically it's stupid to be dollar cost averaging during bull markets. You want to be dollar cost averaging during bare markets because it will lower your average buy price. And I think I I I don't think I I saw uh Larry Frink literally say this a few weeks ago saying that he had he knows sovereign wealth funds buying Bitcoin at 100,000 at 90,000 at 80,000. They're just buying and buying and buying and they're just dollar cost averaging in because they know on the long-term time horizon they're okay with putting their money in it and just waiting. And that's, you know, so if you're going to be dollar cost averaging, if you have a strategy and that involves dollar cost averaging, dollar cost averaging during during the bare markets, dollar cost average during the bare markets, imagine if you dollar cost, just look at this. Literally, this is Bitcoin. Imagine first off during the bull market if you dollar cost averaged here and you were just dollar cost averaging, dollar cost averaging. Well, your average buy price is going to get higher and higher and higher and higher and higher. But what if you dollar cost averaged during the bare market? you know, your your average buy price gets lower and lower and lower and lower and lower and lower and lower, okay? And then event your average buy price would probably been around $20,000 even if you started at the top. So, that's another great strategy to do during bare markets. of course only into the into the best things such as in crypto that's Bitcoin maybe also Ethereum uh maybe Salana but like yeah dollar cost averaging is actually a good strategy now when it it's not normally it's not a good strategy but um yeah so that's that's dollar cost averaging during bare markets and like I said before if you don't want to do that if you want to keep on trading you could try other markets as well um I I pointed out the ones that I'm looking at Um and then another thing another thing use this opportunity to instead of uh instead of trading like like with size uh first off number one lower your position size lower your actual position sizes on everything right that's number one and number two is that um use this time now that you have more free time because you're not you know rushing to find the next uh 100x gem or whatever and and and the markets aren't going crazy on you. You have the time to test. You have the time to create new strategies. You have the time to study markets. You have like if I didn't take the time during like this this time down here, I wouldn't have like I I'll show you. I'll literally show you. I knew that September September was going to be the high. September or October was going to be the high. I knew that back in like 2023. And I knew that because I created this chart back in 2023, maybe 2022 actually. Uh let me let me let me find the uh exact exact thing. Uh 2021, sorry. Oh. Oh, no. Wait a minute. Look at this. Look at this. This was in 20. It was still 2020. So I made this chart in 2020. Five six a little over five and a half years ago. I made this chart such a long time ago and this chart said that the fourth cycle high was going to be in the last week of September."

I made this chart such a long time ago and this chart said that the fourth cycle high was going to be in the last week of September. Oh [ __ ] Was it actually? It actually No, this is the fiveday. But yeah, it worked. Like this was this was it. Why did I do this? And I did this I did this during during uh like a long long long time ago when I had more time uh because I wanted to know from the fourth having from the from the Bitcoin low to the Bitcoin low from the Bitcoin uh having to the Bitcoin having from the Bitcoin having to the Bitcoin cycle uh cycle high from the cycle high to the cycle high and I analyzed all these things and I put alerts in. Right? So, it's like these are these are the things that you should be doing when you're not actively trading and when the markets aren't like easy to trade is like looking back at data and and using data to come up with thesis thesis um and then use that to, you know, help you out with your with your market analysis. like right like this chart. This chart right here says that that the low is probably going to be in August or September or October, you know, August, September, October sometime, maybe November of of 2026. So, I'm not going to be doing too much like during like trading and trying to I'm not going to be throwing large sums of money into the crypto market until either around that time occurs or I see something like just undeniable, you know, happens in the markets to make me bullish. But really, I'm going to be waiting uh, you know, at least another seven months, maybe honestly eight months before um before I'm I'm super super super bullish again. That's just me. uh you know but that that's what you can do right now is you could look and use data and then put alerts in also so you don't forget you know and and and put alerts in your charts and put alerts in your calendar otherwise you will forget um and just do that because now is the time to back test and forward test strategies and and and really learn the market read books read books on trading read books on investors uh the Market Wizards books is great. Naked candle naked trading or naked candlesticks is an amazing book. Um the new uh the new um trading for a living is a great one. Uh the the turtle traders is a fun read. I've read all these, you know, and I I read all of them during 2022 during the bare market, right? And and also 2019 uh during the bare market 2019. And then during the bull markets is when I actually traded. So, these are all things that you could be doing during the bare markets. And um yeah, the other thing the other thing is that when you do make money during bare markets, it's so easy to give it all back. So, just take some out. Take it out. Like if you win, take it out of the market, you know, and then once things get easy again, go back in with it. Okay? That way you're at least capturing some gains, right? Instead of giving it all back. Um and then finally the last thing is is is go with the momentum. Go with the you know what actually is working and like where where the probabilities lie. So in bull markets obviously you want to long you want to buy and then long and have the price go up. In bare markets in bare markets you want to like shorting is more favorable. It's more favorable to short in bare markets because the price goes down more than it goes up. Like it's very simple. It's a very simple concept that like people don't follow."

It's a very simple concept that like people don't follow. It's like during bull markets long during bare markets short. Done. Like like you'll make so much more money that way if you want to actually trade these markets, right? And um that's that's I mean we I just gave you so many different tips and and tricks and and things and and knowledge on how to actually trade you know a bare market and these are these are things that I'm doing and this is just the way that uh what I've learned over you know eight years. So, if y'all have any questions, you could ask them. And um if not, then I'm going to end it because we went over all of this stuff right here. And if you, you know, take a look at these things and and if there's something that you don't you aren't really really, you know, like good in or you don't understand, like like look into all of them and whichever ones that you need to master better or you need to like get better at or you need to um, you know, understand more because you're only as weak as you're only as strong as your weakest link, right? So that's super super important. Um I mean BTC rally shortlived I I believe. So like like I had my sell orders like I was telling everyone to sell at 97K. Why? Because well on the way down first first off I know a lot of people bought at 94 including myself. you know, everyone who actually sold, you know, up here, a lot of people ended up buying back at 94. So, it's like, okay, at 94 it's probably going to, you know, people are going to want to get out at around 94, 95, 96, 97. But then also, if you take the fib from the top to the bottom, uh the literally like the 38.2 is at is at 98K and I want to get out a little bit before that, right? So, you know, 97 that makes sense. Uh there's that giant giant trend line that we have, you know. So, if it does come back up, I I wish I really want it to come back up. Uh but like damn, like at least on the like I really want to come up and hit 10 like like 101, but this is a pretty bad looking this is this is not really looking that good. uh considering what happened because we were in this range, right? You know, we were in the range uh sorry from here to here and um yeah, we basically we basically broke out of it and had a fake breakout and then, you know, slammed back down and now we're back in the range. So, I think like 94K is going to be a pretty big res. It's going to like remember 94K was was this big resistance like continuously we got rejected from 94 95. Like I think if it does come back up there like we're pro it's probably going to be another big resistance, you know? It's like I'm not I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel or use rocket science here. It's like it it got rejected multiple times. It had a fake breakout. So, if it comes back up, like the likelihood of it getting rejected is pretty high, you know. So, that's that's what I'm thinking. Um, my favorite time trade uh time frame to trade on is um in the bull market, well, actually in both markets, probably probably 12 hour for 12 or 4 hour. 12 hour or 4 hour. Um, you could get a little bit better entries on the 4 hour sometimes, but like even like I I really like using the 12-h hour."

Um, you could get a little bit better entries on the 4 hour sometimes, but like even like I I really like using the 12-h hour. I think I think that gives you just a slight advantage over the people who only use the daily time frame because, you know, you could see it you could see it faster uh what what's happening faster using the 12-h hour. So, it's it's you get a little heads up, a little a little jump start uh compared to the people who only use the daily. And also it's not low enough to where it muddles the noise you know because on the high time frames like you know high time frame daily 12-hour you get a really good picture of the actual frame of the actual trend of the market you know on if you start at the 4 hour and then you go down to the 1 hour it's like you it could become difficult to know like like you know the actual trend of the market right like at least unless you're just unless you're literally just like trying to get those quick wins. Uh for instance, like you know this is this is like the 4 hour, right? It looks like a bull market, right? The 4 hour it looks like an uptrend. Like it's great. Uh so if you're going to do that, then I would say like, okay, cool. Use it. Use the 4 hour, but get out at a reasonable time. Like you can't you can't hold it. You have to look at the higher time frames. So, it's like if you know, let's say you put this this type of trade on, this is a good trade, right? Um, you would get out here and then you would just you would get out. It's about like getting in and getting out, right? Uh, on the lower time frames. Um, anyway, top three indicators you like to use. Uh, I love the Fibonacci. That's my favorite indicator of all time, Fibonacci. And, um, what else? What other indicators? Oh, RSI and MACD. And for the RSI and MACD, I look for bullish and bearish divergences. So, those are the ones that I that I use. I don't I don't really care, you know, if if there's not a divergence in the RSI or the MACD, I don't really care. Um, but looking for divergences in not just those two indicators, but in every indicator that you have uh that you could that that there are divergences forming in, that's a really good way to just make sure you catch them. catch the big moves and aren't on the wrong side. Um I'm I mean instead of going down 70% to 36k, we will bounce from let's say 50 to 60k. Yeah, I don't see 36k in the cards. Uh you know, I don't I don't think we're going to go down to 36k. That's to me that's to me that's sort of ridiculous. Um, and also it's like, you know, even if we do go down to 36K, I mean, I mean, you could get in like if I would be so happy to get in at say 48K, you know? I'd be so stoked to buy at 48K and then just walk away and we could go down to 20. I don't care. Like, like I'm in at 48. like like we're going to, you know, it's going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars one day. So 48's fine fine for me. Like I I don't know. 36 is just too just seems way I mean it just seems way too way too low. Um yeah, but who knows? You know, nobody really knows. Maybe maybe maybe we do. No, actually looking at the Fibonacci now, I don't see it. um because I don't think we're going to go down below the 78.6 and that is around 39,000. So yeah, I don't see us going down below 39K."

If if if we bottom out if if we if we have like worst case not worst case scenario, but like sort of sort of one of the worst cases scenario, I would say 39 $39,170 is going to be the bottom. and you could pin that. Um, otherwise, you know, probably golden ratio seems pretty good to me. But yeah, so that's it. All right, guys. Thank you so much for watching. As long as there's no more questions. I'm going to end it here. Hopefully, you learned something. You know, how to trade and what you could do in the bare market. You don't need to you don't need to be trading, but you could do all of these different things, right? All of these different things. Yeah, I'll um Okay, I'll maybe I'll I'll you I'll make a tutorial for uh the fib uh later down the road. Damn. Well, thanks Brett for uh watching even at 3:00 a.m. I really appreciate that. That's awesome. But also get some sleep because sleep is very very important. Okay, you got to rest. Got to rest, my man. Awesome. Okay. Well, thank you so much and I will see you all next week. Bye."
