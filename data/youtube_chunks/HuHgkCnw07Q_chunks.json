      "text": "Friday, guys. Let's set ourselves up for the \nweekend. I heard there's a bit of news today. Trump tariffs, illegal, non-illegal, bunch \nof things. Nonetheless, spoken to a lot of   the teams this morning. Looks like we're going \nto see probably a bunch of news volatility that   we need to pay attention to. But the good sign \nis we've spoken a lot around markets coming and   hitting these supports. And I am seeing a bounce \ncoming very soon. Now, again, we got a bit of   volatility. So again, there might be one little \nswoop and I do want to speak about if there's   a little swoop a little bit lower, there is a \nlittle bit of support sitting lower down, but   ultimately again I am still incredibly bullish \nin these areas and this is where I am building   trades. Yesterday we had the Solana trade. I did \ngo into a bit of profit on the Bitfunded. I want   to speak around the next trades I got out. I want to speak around the next trades on my   Bitfunded accounts and I want to speak about what \nopportunities we're looking for right now. I think   Zcash opportunity I want to speak a lot around \nthat too. I think the news was a little bit too   overreacted to so we need to pay attention to \nbig opportunities but ultimately let's prepare   ourselves for the weekend going into weekly \nclose. We got a volatile day today as well   as going into weekly close. So I think markets \nare going to spark up into weekly close. Look   to get a nice strong weekly close to give us a \nnice strong week next week. Remember we are now   in this disbelief phase. The next phase we are \npreparing ourselves for is the hope phase which   means we sit in this pullback for day two days, \nthree days but ultimately this is where we need   to pay attention to build positions. The hard work \ncomes into building your entries, not waiting for   the market to pump and then wanting to buy in. So \nlet's go through many altcoins today. Let's get   some trade setups going and let's get prepared \nfor the weekend. So, no wasting time. Let's go. Putting my other AirPod in. It was I was feeling \nlike I was like hearing weird things. Yo,   man. What's happening? It's been a long year. 2026 \nlike it's felt like it's been a long damn year. It's been one week back in the office. It's been \na long crazy year. I'm feeling a little bit tired   today. But ultimately happy to be back, happy \nto get things going. Remember, set yourself a   great foundation to beginning of the year, good \nroutines, good people, protect your energy, and   just keep learning and staying focused, and you \nwill be rewarded for that hard work as long as you   don't quit and keep going and keep improving. That \nis how you get to the life that all of you are   searching for. Love you guys lots. I always just \nwant to remind you that to say thank you for those   that have been watching for years that have been \nsupporting. I just want to say thank you guys. Thank you so much for believing being a part of it \nall. And I'm excited for our future and I'm very   excited for this year too. I do think it's going \nto be a reward year. You know, I was speaking to   um it's actually so weird. This last 2025, there \nwas two times I was my highest net worth and two   times I was my lowest net worth in one year. Such a weird year, right? Two times I was my   highest net worth, right? Two times my lowest net \nworth in one damn year. So, it was one of those,   right? One of those. And those are constructive \nyears. This year will be the reward year. We just   got to keep going, keep fighting, and keep pushing \nthrough. So let's get going. Yes, happy new year   to all of you. Lots of love to all of you. So \nlet's get going through a couple of things. Paying   attention to a couple of RSIs. We have the 4 hour \nthat was reset now starting to lift off. We have   the 8 hour sitting at the bottom. And we have the \n12-hour also coming into the bottom stages. And we   have the daily sitting in the middle. So, what \nwe're basically looking at this over here is a   temporary bounce is incoming, right? Specifically \non the 8 hour and 12 hour charts."

So let's get going through a couple of things. Paying attention to a couple of RSIs. We have the 4 hour that was reset now starting to lift off. We have the 8 hour sitting at the bottom. And we have the 12-hour also coming into the bottom stages. And we have the daily sitting in the middle. So, what we're basically looking at this over here is a temporary bounce is incoming, right? Specifically on the 8 hour and 12 hour charts. And what this   means is look for a temporary bounce for the next \ncouple of days very much a little bit of a reset   after that and then get ready for the next phase. Right? We're basically preparing ourselves for   this phase of us going from these areas which is \nthe disbelief pump, right? And actually getting   Bitcoin back up to the areas of close to the \n100,000. So the key is not to be chasing here. The key is to be looking at entries over here. And in order to enter the market, you got to give   yourself three or four validations, right? For me \nspecifically, if I look at high time frame views,   right, the weekly is at the bottom. So it's \na no-brainer right now. Anything to do with   investment long-term views inside a crypto, I'm \nvery much interested at buying and accumulating   at these levels, right? Because high time frame \nmarkets are oversold. Then if I look at the next   part of my strategy, which is the areas of \nand this is why yesterday I built the bots,   the long-term bots, not the midterm bots, \nlong-term bots. Anything to do longterm,   I'm interested at these levels to accumulate the \nbest in the market, right? Then on the other side,   I'm obviously looking at trading this market. Okay, there's a couple of ways. This market's been   really good at taking money over the last couple \nof months, so I'm a little bit more protective   with the amount of money. You know, again, I have \none rule. Don't go zero, right? We've all taken   losses. We've all dropped through. December was \none of my lowest, I wouldn't say net worth months,   right? Of what? Income to my portfolio, to my \ntraining, to everything. One of the lowest,   right? And the important thing is now you got \nto go into protection zone. It's like being in a   boxing fight, right? We've taken a couple punches \nnow, but it's very important now that I don't take   too many more serious punches. Take one or two \nlittle jabs, one or two little hits, but don't   get knocked out, right? You get knocked out. That's the important thing. But end of the day,   I still got to remember that me just blocking, \nright, ain't going to get me to win the fight. I   still got to knock the opponent out as well and \nwin the fight, right? So, I still have to throw   punches, okay? But it just means that I need to \ntime the punches a little bit better. I mustn't   lose my structure when I'm throwing the punches. And what that means is don't drop your guard when   you're opening your pawn shop. So don't just \nopen up all your risk when you are taking on   risk to make more money, right? Ultimately still \nkeep the guards. And that's where I was looking   at the options of okay, how can I have a lot of \nmoney if it goes in my favor, right? But how do I   lose a lot less money if this market continues \nto kind of chop around a little bit and these   type of things? And that's when funded accounts, \nall these different things came into play for me   where I can have just as much money to the upside. Okay, but ultimately my downside is a little bit   more calculated. But end of the day, I have the \nlong-term approach where the market is oversold   long-term. Anything to do longterm, I'm interested \nin these areas. The second two is the trading,   right? I've now come to an understanding. I need \nto use tools that look after risk a little bit   more, but still give me enough power to the \nupside. Okay. But now we look at the data of   what do I need to see for my trading, right?"

I've now come to an understanding. I need to use tools that look after risk a little bit more, but still give me enough power to the upside. Okay. But now we look at the data of what do I need to see for my trading, right? And ultimately if I look at the current market   right now, okay, and I look at where we are \nand again we've looked at the emotion cycles,   okay? And if this level gets broken, which I spoke \nis at 94,000, we are very much likely going into   the hope stage, right? And I got to keep that in \nmind for as long as we stay below 94,000 we are   still sitting in disbelief slash depression phase. Okay. So as a trader I got to now look at that and   say okay if we stay in depression phase what does \nthat mean? It means that pumps come small pumps at   any point come they don't last long market comes \ndown and then pumps again and ultimately pumps up   pumps down pumps up pumps down. Right? So for as \nlong as we are sitting in depression level, okay,   which is the chop, I need to be realistic that \nwhen I take a trade, I make some money, get out,   right? Be patient, wait for the next entry, get \nin. So I'm not holding positions for too long. But there needs to be a certain point where my \nsoftware or my strategy gets adjusted, right? And   that's that point for me of the break of this high \nhere, right? Because if we start going into this   territory where we start, let's say, pushing up to \nthis area over here, I don't want to be getting in   and getting out because where do I get back in, \nright? Because the market's going to basically   make a higher time frame move. Okay? So, it set \nme up with this basic play right now to say, okay,   as it stands right now, anything that I'm still \nbuying in these type of areas, I mustn't be too   afraid to take some sort of profits, but I need to \nrealize that if we do break through here, right,   I need to be ready for that and these entries \nwon't come as often. Okay, that's why yesterday   I got the Bitfunded trade. I actually got stopped \nout, which I spoke to you guys about. There we go. I entered, got stopped out. You can see the arrows \nright over here. This was me buying in and out. Stopped out and then I caught this pump. Got out a \nlittle bit early because again we're in depression   phase. So I would now make some money, get out and \nnow I'm sitting back in a little bit of profits   over here. Okay, but not in a current trade. I'm \nactually looking at this current pullback right   now to get ready for my next major entries. Okay, \nbut I need to realize these next entries can be a   big one because from here, if we start pushing \nin here, I would love to have entries down over   here too. Okay. Now, in order for me to look at \nthat now, I'm starting to build a strategy that   previously I would hold a trade for anywhere up \nto 24 hours and get out. Right? So, that meant   that when it came to time frame wise on charting \nspecifically, the one hour was very important for   me when it came to the RSI. So, when I was fishing \nfor entries, right? Because the 1 hour RSI tells   me if I get in over here, okay, this usually takes \naround 12 hours to 20 hours to get up here. This   is the perfect time frame. But now in the back of \nmy head, I'm like, okay, but what happens if we go   into this hope phase, okay, I need to be prepared \nfor that too. So what that means then is I need to   adjust to a time frame that also suits that. Okay, \nwhich is a little bit of the higher time frames,   4 hour, 8 hour, 12 hour, right?"

So what that means then is I need to adjust to a time frame that also suits that. Okay, which is a little bit of the higher time frames, 4 hour, 8 hour, 12 hour, right? Something that \ncan maybe keep me in trades for 4 days or so. Okay. But again, we are still unknown if it's \ngoing to be the hope phase or not. Okay. So,   I take both information. Entries that I'm looking \nfor right now is I'm looking for 1 hour RSIs at   the bottom and I'm looking for 8hour 12-hour RSIs \nat the bottom. Once I get the entry, both of them   are telling me there's some growth to come. We \nhave to break a certain level. We don't break   the level, I take profits. If we break the level, \nI hold the trade for a lot longer. Nonetheless,   these time frames and specifically four of the \nmidterm trading time frames right now are telling   me to look for entries on this pullback and look \nfor these areas. The next thing I look at is the   catalyst and at least three, four, five things to \ntell me where to buy. Right? So again, the first   thing is the support trend line. Are we near? Have \nwe hit support by the trend line in Bitcoin? Yes,   we have. Where's support? Anywhere here from this \n88,000 to the 90 91,000 that I've spoken about,   there's the trend. Is there support nearby in \nthese areas? Yes. All these previous highs that   were the previous highs, we've made a new high. These are all previous support levels. Our RSI   is at the bottom. Yes. Right now, what's the last \nthing confirmation that I'm looking for is have   we broken the major trend from the top? No, we \nhave not. But we are hours away from doing so. So again, I told you guys around two days back \nthat I see trade entries being ready in two days. Just remember, we are now crunching up close to \nthis trend line and we should see either one more   shake and I'll speak about that in a sec. Now, \nokay, but we should see some breakouts in the next   24 hours to the possible upside. What changes \nthat is us losing 88 $87,000 Bitcoin price,   which means that is where I put my stop losses. Nonetheless, entries are coming very near and we   need to be prepared for it. So on today, the way \nit kind of stands for me at the moment is I have   a couple of plays on Bitcoin. We are not far from \nthe trend as you can see. So the first one is we   push, bit of news comes out, we drop with this \nand we break. Okay, that's the first play. The   second one for me is we break out, we retest, and \nwe go. That tells me that news maybe says bullish,   news gets trapped, then we rock it up. Okay, so \nthese are the two major plays that I'm looking   for here on Bitcoin. Bearish is this. So stops \nover here or anywhere under low here are quite   important for me. If that happens, I'm fishing way \nlower. Again, no one is upset when the market goes   lower when we have money. We're upset when it goes \ndown and we lost a bunch of money. We don't have   money to capitalize on these lower entries, right? So, for me, having stops at protective areas,   super super super important. Okay. When \nit comes to altcoins, we're in the zone,   guys. Charts are telling me we go up. Charts are \ndefinitely telling me we're going up, right? So,   the thing when it comes to altcoins, let's zoom \nin here. Is the trend line. So, I want to show you   guys a nice strong trend to pay attention to here. It's not the major top. It's these two tops here. Why are you saying that, Sheldon? More touches is \nalways stronger, right? More touch trend lines. One, two, three touch trend line telling us hours \naway."

More touch trend lines. One, two, three touch trend line telling us hours away. You don't have to fall into this unless it's   the long-term approach. But in the next few hours, \nwhen you see whatever volatility happens and we   break, that is going to be the entry and the \ntrigger points to your trade positions, right? Trades that I'm really paying attention to. Okay, \nif we look at ETH, let's go to ETH here. ETH for   me is a very nice Bitfunded tool. I've realized \nwith Bitfunded and just a hint, right, is when I   trade more volatile coins, I get smashed pretty \nquickly because it's about risk. Okay, so I like   ETH and SOL, the more larger caps move a little \nbit slower. Way easier to pass challenges than   trading the volatile tokens. Okay, so I'm going to \nbe sitting out of the market for the next four to   eight hours and I'll be triggering when we break \nthese trend lines. Here's ETH as well. Put these   trends in, guys. When these trends break, this \nis the opportunity we are paying attention to for   entries. Right? When it comes to Solana, one token \nthat's actually stronger than most the markets. It   broke out yesterday. It broke out. I sold a bit \nearly. I sold over here. It went a lot higher. That's cool. You know why is it cool? Because it \nwill pull back into where I sold out. Right? So,   as it stands now, it has hit support, but I do \nthink there's a possibility of SOL coming back   to the areas of the 135 136. And again, I don't \nwant to predict that it's going to bounce there. It should bounce there. Okay. But ultimately, \nwhen we make this next low and push down,   there will be a trend line and an execution point. Stop below the point over here. Right? So a lot of   them if I look at this here on AVAX AVAX let's see \nthe trend there's a nice strong trend over there   also a few hours out okay so I'm calling bull \nI'm calling pump but I'm not saying that there   won't be a bit of this before so I don't want \nto be in that news day right let the volatility   happen when those trends break if you missed \nand all of a sudden there's a green candle don't   chase wait for this wait for this that is where \nyou are looking to execute and build. Remember,   a couple of nice options for you guys. We have \nbots right now. Here's some specials for you   guys. Links below in the description. If you're \nlooking for an exchange, here's Bybit. Okay,   got good signup bonuses at the moment over here. And remember, there's also Bitfunded right with   the challenges from today. Right now, if you \nbuy a one-step evaluation, any package, okay,   you get a free two-step evaluation at the \nsame value. So, if you buy $1,400 package,   you get another $1,400 package free today, right? Only today. Let's go here. In the description,   where's Bitfunded? There is Bitfunded over there \nif you guys are interested. For me, majority,   90% of my trading on Bitfunded right now for \nnow, right? I actually want to make some more   money on Bitfunded, help load the other accounts \nup a little bit more, wait for the markets, go   into that hope stage, and then I'll trade more of \nmy cash. Right now, if I can trade way more than   what I got off of least risk, that is 100% what \nI am doing. So again, it's quite simple today. Know that it's news. Know that we still have space \nbefore the trend where the manipulation is going   to happen. When the manipulation is done, that is \nwhere you want to pounce and go through for the   weekly closes. Why I think the market is going to \npush up, right? Specifically on Bitcoin as well. Okay."

I   actually think this candle is going to form nice \nand strong. Okay. But we are straight into weekly   support here. Weekly RSI is at the bottom getting \nready to exit through the top. Now remember prices   move when we start to exit. So here we sat here \nfor a while but the moment we started to exit this   oversold territory is when things started to move \nnice and strong. Right? So I think by the end of   the week we are going to push and remember once we \nget through the highs of 94 the next resistance is   at $102,000. Okay. The shorters are arrogant \nright now. The short the the bear YouTubers   are arrogant right now. At some point they are \ngoing to get smashed. So guys have a absolute   great weekend. I will see you guys on Monday. We \nwill be releasing dates on when we're doing the   Bitfunded challenge together. We're going to be \ndoing a 7-day Bitfunded pass outside of the shows   outside of everything. Pass a Bitfunded and get \na funded account passed and ready to go. We're   doing that together as well. I'll release those \ndates on Monday as well as a new challenge that   we are going to be releasing which is going to \nbe very cool. Okay. And remember to join Sniper   Club as well. Link below in the description. Guys, have a great weekend. Get lots of rest. Spend time with the fam and don't miss the damn \ntrend line break. Have a great day. Bye-bye."
