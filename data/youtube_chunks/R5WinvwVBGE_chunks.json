      "text": "There's a rotation happening right now that everyone's missing. The oldest indicator in economics just hit all-time highs. The economy itself has had 10 straight months of contraction. This shouldn't be possible unless there's two economies, one shrinking, one exploding. And if you can understand which one Bitcoin follows, you'll see why this setup looks like 2016 and 2020. Let's go. This video is for information and entertainment only. It reflects my personal opinions and is not financial advice. Check the description for more information. Always do your own research. This episode is supported by Uphold. You'll hear more from them later in the episode. Hey guys, I'm Alessandro. Welcome back to the show. To fully understand this relationship, we first need to understand what the indicator is. This indicator is copper. It's called Dr. Copper because it tends to diagnose the economy before official data sees it. Why is this? Copper goes into everything: buildings, cars, phones, wiring. When factories order copper, they're ordering months before products actually ship. So copper moves first and data confirms it later. There's a 0.91 correlation with manufacturing output when copper leads by one month. It's nigh on perfect. One would be perfectly correlated. In late 2007, copper rolled over while stocks kept running. The crash came a few months later. In 2020, copper bottomed while everything else panic sold. Recovery followed. It's not magic. It's just seeing demand before any surveys catch up. So, where are we now? Copper just hit all-time highs, had its best year since 2009, up over 42%. But the US manufacturing PMI is in contraction: 47.9. 10 straight months of contraction, including just recently in December. 85% of US manufacturing GDP was shrinking in December. Now, globally, it's been barely above the expansion line. China is a tenth of a point from contraction. This doesn't really make any sense. When copper breaks to new highs, usually the PMI should be screaming higher. Instead, we've got copper screaming growth, while the economic data says the opposite. Now, one of them is wrong. Or maybe something fundamental has changed. Copper is no longer just responding to traditional manufacturing demand. There's a new demand driver that didn't exist three years ago. Obviously, this driver is AI. Just last week, S&P Global dropped a report called Copper in the Age of AI. And the headline was demand is going from 28 million metric tons to 42 million by 2040. That's 50% more copper needed in 15 years. And the thing is that there just isn't enough. The traditional economy—construction, appliances, cars—they still take a big chunk of the copper demand. But this transition, EVs use 3x more copper than gas cars. Electric buses use 10 to 15 times more copper. AI and data centers, this one came out of nowhere really, but a single hyperscale data center uses 50,000 tons of copper. And it's not just the servers; it's the grids used to upgrade them, power them, etc. Defense as well"

Electric buses use 10 to 15 times more copper. AI and data centers, this one came out of nowhere really, but a single hyperscale data center uses 50,000 tons of copper. And it's not just the servers; it's the grids used to upgrade them, power them, etc. Defense as well is a massive consumer of copper. Global military spending could double by 2040. Trump just added $500 billion to the US military spend. So again, higher demand for copper there. It's a very copper-heavy industry and three years ago AI wasn't even on the table. It wasn't even on the radar of copper demand and now it's one of the key drivers. Obviously, this is creating a supply problem. Supply can't keep up. Copper production should peak in 2030 and then it's going to start declining. This is because ore grades are falling. So, the thing that's actually pulled out of the ground, the quality, how much copper you get out of it, is getting less over time. You need about 2.5 times more rock out of the ground to get the same copper you used to get 100 years ago. And new mines take about 17 years from being discovered to producing copper. So even if prices double tomorrow, new supply can't arrive, even with enormous investments in the infrastructure to actually mine the material. S&P Global's projection of 10 million metric tons by 2040 is a 25% deficit to demand. 25% is missing. They can't service it based upon that particular report. But what does any of this have to do with Bitcoin? There's a ratio macro traders watch and it's the copper to gold ratio. Copper divided by gold. Copper signals growth. Gold signals fear. When copper outperforms gold, it's risk on. When gold outperforms copper, it's risk off. It's a tried and tested formula that has worked for years. And here's why it matters. The last three times this ratio bottomed and turned were 2013, 2017, and 2021. All Bitcoin cycle peaks came after this point. And right now, the ratio looks like it's in a bottoming formation. And what you can see is Bitcoin in gold and then copper over gold in blue. And what you can see is that typically when you see these green arrows at the bottom, they correspond to a move in Bitcoin and a corresponding move in the ratio between copper and gold happens here. It happens on this one. It happens on this one and it happens on this one. And you can see that also lines up quite nicely with the peaks as well. Bitcoin peaked here in 2014 right around the copper-gold peak. Bitcoin peaks here in"

Bitcoin peaked here in 2014 right around the copper-gold peak. Bitcoin peaks here in 2017 right around the copper-gold peak as well. You can see here in 2021, this peak was met, you know, just a little bit after this copper-gold peak. What we've seen recently is Bitcoin has trended upwards from the low, but copper-gold has gone down. So, there's this big divergence. So, the question is, is this relationship completely broken or did Bitcoin rise because liquidity increased? And now we're starting to see this turnaround in actual manufacturing from copper to gold. And this next expansion of the true economy might pull Bitcoin along with it. No one's got a crystal ball. No one can say exactly what's going to happen, but I think this relationship is more likely to revert than continue to diverge. Now bear in mind, this is a chart that shows 18 years. These things do not happen quickly. These bottoms between gold and copper can take a very, very long time to form. Just check this chart here. And you can see that it looks like it could be putting in this bottoming formation right down here. Now, this green box, it just shows you, look, all of these bars here, they're the length of time pretty much that copper took to form a bottom against gold. You can see here it took 270 days and then 950 days and etc. And just at the bottom, I've given you the averages. So, on average, it's about 500 days to find a bottom. And the shortest time was 252 days and the longest time was 945 days. And that's all this green box over here gives you. The range from the shortest to the longest plus the dotted line in the middle being the average. And you can see right now we're just coming into what would be considered normal ranges for copper to find a bottom against gold. So it's not happening right this second, but the setup is beginning to form. But there are some things that don't really add up. Bitcoin and copper are both liquidity plays. When money's flowing, both should rise. Yet, copper has been at all-time highs and Bitcoin has been stuck down from the 126k peak in October and looks like it could be heading into a bear market. So, why the divergence? You've probably seen this chart a million times. It's Bitcoin overlaid with the Purchasing Managers Index. The"

Yet, copper has been at all-time highs and Bitcoin has been stuck down from the 126k peak in October and looks like it could be heading into a bear market. So, why the divergence? You've probably seen this chart a million times. It's Bitcoin overlaid with the Purchasing Managers Index. The index that says, is the economy growing in the US or is it shrinking in the US? And what you can see is there's a clear divergence recently. Bitcoin's been moving up and the PMI has been going nowhere. But this is a chart that's just as interesting to see. This is copper against the PMI. And you can see basically it's the same thing. When copper runs, the PMI is moving higher. The PMI is above 50. When copper is contracting, again, the PMI is under 50 or it's going back down. This isn't surprising. This is exactly what you would expect to see because copper is a heavy industry metal. Obviously, the Purchasing Managers Index is saying, are you buying more stuff than last month? Yes or no? If they're buying more copper, they're producing more stuff. The price of copper should be rising. These two things have traded very, very closely. The relationship is about 0.91. This relationship looks like it's massively diverged. Now, why the change? Why the divergence? This is what I think is happening. Copper and the PMI are measuring different portions, different parts of the economy. Buried in the ISM data was this computer and electronics products expanded in six of the last 12 months. Second half surged likely from data centers. Now the AI sectors are growing. They're just not big enough yet to offset the weakness in traditional manufacturing. You know, chemicals, machinery, transportation, etc. that takes up about 85% currently of US manufacturing GDP. So effectively there's two economies that the PMI is measuring. The old economy which is traditional manufacturing, construction, consumer goods etc. All of that is contracting. That's what the PMI is measuring. But this new economy—AI infrastructure, electric vehicles, grid upgrades, defense—is rapidly expanding as we've seen from the stock market getting pulled up largely by the Magnificent 7. And that's what copper is being priced in. Global EV sales were up 20% in 2025. Europe's EV market share is up 33% in 2025. So, as these sectors get bigger, the PMI will follow. And copper is the leading indicator for that and it has been multiple times in the past. Just check this data here. What you can see in this dashboard here is the Purchasing Managers Index. So whether the US economy is growing or shrinking against copper on a year-on-year percentage basis. So"

Just check this data here. What you can see in this dashboard here is the Purchasing Managers Index. So whether the US economy is growing or shrinking against copper on a year-on-year percentage basis. So was it going up that year on average or was it going down that year on average? You can see that basically these two symbols they kind of trade one to one, right? This white line in the middle is the zero line. When they're above zero, you know, copper price is going up or the PMI is above 50 and expanding. And when it's beneath zero, PMI is contracting or copper is going down. And you can see that basically when you run through here from 1950 onwards, the blue line goes up, gold line is also going up. The blue line goes down, the gold line is also going down. And it happens pretty much throughout all of history until now. Where we are right now, there's a big divergence. Copper has gone upwards and the PMI is still underneath 50, still contracting. So this is where this divergence is coming from. The setup remains very simple. Copper is telling us something about where the world is going and historically when the world goes in that direction, Bitcoin has tagged along for the ride. So what am I doing with all this information? To be honest, the same thing that I always do, which is I'm not really trying to time the copper Bitcoin divergence. I'm not making levered bets on when the PMI recovers. The US economy is definitely in a very odd place right now. No one really knows what's going to happen. Consumer sentiment is dying. Stocks are ripping. There's enormous spend in capital expenditure for AI heightened by this drive for copper, etc. But other industries are really struggling. Copper sees growth before the data does. The copper gold ratio is forming a bottom. It looks like historically that's preceded every major Bitcoin cycle. We've had three major copper super cycles in modern history. Electrification of the Western world in the late 1800s and you know the early 1900s. Post-World War II, the rebuild required substantial quantities of copper. And the rise of China in the 2000s. What we're looking at now could well be a fourth industrial revolution requiring enormous amounts of copper. Except this time it's not tied to one country industrializing. It's the entire world electrifying transportation, you know, building AI infrastructure, rising geopolitical tensions, and even, you know, people like Elon Musk saying that AGI is likely to be here."

We'll hit AGI next year in 26. The last two times gold and silver peaked and copper ran afterwards. Copper preceded an enormous Bitcoin rally. You can see in this chart here, gold and silver top on the left in 2017. Then copper goes on a 62% run. At the same time, Bitcoin did 30x. You know, I'm not saying that's going to happen again. In 2021, the same pattern happened. Gold and silver topped. Copper ran 74% after that point, and Bitcoin followed 5x along the way. We've been looking at the PMI a lot. But as we dug into what the PMI actually means, its economic expansion, what if the new economy relies a lot less on old businesses and a lot more on new businesses? And if those new businesses require enormous demand for copper, then actually it can help paint the picture of where the broader economy could be moving and as liquidity flows in, we know that Bitcoin acts as this liquidity sponge and can capture a decent chunk of that liquidity. But fundamentally, the vast majority of my actual holdings just DCA into the market every single month. Massive shout out to Uphold as well for bringing you this episode.
