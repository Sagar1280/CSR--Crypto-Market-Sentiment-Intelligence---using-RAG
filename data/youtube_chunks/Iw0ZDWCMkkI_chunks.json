      "text": "Morgan Stanley is the latest seeking regulatory approval to launch ETFs tied to Bitcoin and in this case Salana. >> Breaking news. Morgan Stanley becomes the first major United States banking institution to file for a Bitcoin ETF. >> I think that Morgan Stanley being the first big US bank to take this step to file uh to launch its own ETFs is a huge endorsement. >> This is the first big story out of three today that affect you if you hold crypto. to watch today's whole video. >> So, we've started to see this comeback of institutional cash just in the first few trading days of the year. >> While we've had financial institutions offer Bitcoin ETFs in the past, Black Rockck and Fidelity, the largest financial institutions, they've had inflows of billions of dollars of their clients buying Bitcoin over the last two years. >> You know, it's only been less, it's when anniversary, a couple days, two years since IBID originally launched and we've seen it raise tens of billions of dollars. But still many investors have still just been starting their educational journey around what is Bitcoin, how might it fit in a portfolio. For many financial adviserss, maybe they didn't have access to crypto before or even weren't able to buy IBID until it was approved on their platforms. We're starting to see a much uh much more broader um group of people that can and are interested in investing in this asset class. So, we see this still being very early days for Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's a lot more about education. Headlines like this with Morgan Stanley being the first, they're not the last, they're the first US bank major one to offer this means demand for these assets may be just beginning. >> Finally, the surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were net outflows for the last few months of 2025. And what this really signals is that Morgan Stanley, for one, has been the most progressive. They put out their 15,000 FAS pitching spot Bitcoin ETFs back in August 2024 and is a much less popular trade. And now you're seeing Black Rockck's IBIT accounting for the vast majority of the cash that's parked in those spot Bitcoin ETFs. And if I'm Morgan Stanley, I'm thinking why not offer it myself. And they're also through their brokerage Erade going to let customers directly trade and hold the assets themselves as well. >> So I am not a financial adviser. I cannot see the future. But to me, this says that Solana is a buy in 2026 because it has the institutional bid, meaning institutions are pushing it. Morgan Stanley has thousands, tens of thousands of active clientele. They want to make money off of their products. And this is the institutional bid for Solana, which by the way, the institutions pushing it causes the mainstream media to cover it, cover the benefits of owning it. >> And with Salana, a lot of these uh different forms of tokenization. So we talk about tokenized dollars all the time in the context of stable coins, but now we're seeing a lot of people move into tokenizing money market funds and Salana has become a blockchain use case for that and XRP made its name in terms of crossber payments. >> And that brings us to what other coins have the institutional bid in 2026. We see that the mainstream media CNBC is pushing XRP like crazy. They're calling it the hottest crypto trade of 2026. And 2026 has just begun. The hottest crypto trade of the year is not Bitcoin. It is not Ether. It is XRP. And as we continue learning about crypto, it's important to me to understand what is signal and what is noise. To me, saying the hottest crypto trade trade of 2026 when we're 5 days in. That's noise. That elicits excitement. That elicits FOMO. But what's the signal? Click subscribe to Altcoin Daily. We will bring you a video every single day giving you signal, giving you an edge investing in crypto by staying informed and the signal today with XRP peering through piercing through the noise onto the signal. Ripple president Ripple's banned XRP Monica Long just dropped key updates on their mergers and acquisitions and growth strategy. This is what's next for XRP and parent company Ripple in terms of adoption. >> So you mentioned some of those acquisitions. the company has been quite inquisitive. Where do you see M&A opportunities in 2026 and even beyond? What's exciting to you right now? >> Yeah, so um I I mean our the thrust of our M&A strategy has one been to accelerate the uh technology development of our digital asset infrastructure."

Where do you see M&A opportunities in 2026 and even beyond? What's exciting to you right now? >> Yeah, so um I I mean our the thrust of our M&A strategy has one been to accelerate the uh technology development of our digital asset infrastructure. So adding components like um MPC custody through Palisade um as well as you know uh strengthening our stable coin offering with rail um that's kind of part one of our strategy. Part two has been um acquiring complimentary businesses that could be uh users of this infrastructure. So in the case of G treasury, they serve a thousand corporates. Um using stable coins as a new payment mechanism to make crossber money transfer a lot more efficient has been on the minds of corporates. And so you know we now are going to be plugging in those G treasury customers to our infrastructure. And in the case of Ripple Prime, um they you know they serve hundreds of hedge funds and uh we are kind of pushing further into that space of applying blockchain and stable coins um to make collateral mobility a lot more efficient. >> And breaking news, the trend continues. spot XRP ETFs now have 54 consecutive days of inflows as the price continues to rally showing that in 2026 and coming from 2025 XRP has the institutional bid. It's a buy for institutions. We also see the SEC just approved Bitwise's spot chain link ETF showing there is institutional demand for chain link. The US SEC has approved Bitwise's spot chain link ETF for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, marking Chainlink's first direct entry into the US equity markets, meaning any institutional player, just Wall Street investor that now wants exposure to Chainlink. Do they have to download the wallet? Do they have to learn how to custody it? Custody it? No. They just go into their brokerage account and buy the spot chain link ETF. The ETF is expected to launch this week, offering a 0% management fee for the first three months. We also have institutional player Grayscale highlighting what Jensen, CEO of Nvidia, just stated, describing what Bitcoin mining did for Bitensor and AI altcoin, which doesn't specifically name Tao, but he's basically states the value prop of tow is next for AI. Essentially, what Bitcoin is doing is taking excess energy, storing it into a new form. >> It's called currency. >> And you take that currency and you take it wherever you like. And so, you took energy from one place and now you've transported it everywhere. Now, of course, that's just Bitcoin. Imagine a much more universal currency called intelligence. Using exactly all the same concept that you described, you you find places with excess energy. Go put a data center there, trans transfer that energy, compress it into an artificial intelligence model, take that model all over the place to use it. >> And what the NVIDIA CEO is saying is not is pretty right. And we're seeing the institutional bid for something like that. What he was describing like Tao Grayscale's Bit Tensor Trust GTOW is now up over 270% since Christmas. So pay attention to the altcoins with the institutional bid. Of course, if slash when cryptote does well over the next year, few years, Bitcoin and Ethereum will do well, I believe. But now that Bitcoin may only have a 0.5x in it, maybe it's a maybe not a 0.5, maybe it's just a 2x or a little less than a 2x. I mean, can can Bitcoin get to 200K? Maybe just 150k if it does well."

Maybe just 150k if it does well. if it does well, institutional investors and Wall Street investors are starting to think, well, I definitely want some exposure to Bitcoin, but a lot of the gains, not that there won't be gains for a long time, and I'm in it for the long term, but what other exposure to altcoins can get me maybe even a a bigger gain, can be the beta play if slash when Bitcoin does well, even if it's not this year, even it's over the next five years, the longer the time frame is the mindset you want to have. So they've clearly picked XRP, they've clearly picked Solana, and this is a US ccentric focused um play right now. They've clearly picked Chain Link with the approval also Bit Tensor Tow and others. I will keep you updated on any coin mentioned in today's video. Let's keep updated on them. Every week we'll check in every whenever they make news, we'll check in. So, like always, see you"
