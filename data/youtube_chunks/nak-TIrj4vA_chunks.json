      "text": "On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment. >> Nobody saw this coming. Fed Chair Jerome Pal just shook up markets, making an announcement that is the most unprecedented. I mean, we've literally never seen something like this before. This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation. So the Fed is supposed to act independently of the executive branch. Yet we know that Donald Trump has been putting a lot of pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates. We didn't know until this video the severity of the action that Trump is what he's doing to Jerome Powell and the Fed. Again, unprecedented. And then Jerome Powell is not taking it anymore. Here he's pushing back. Guys, smash the like button. More people need to see this video. The Fed posted this statement late Sunday night. Let's finish the clip and then we'll discuss. On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings. I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role. The Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president. This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation. I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people. Thank you. So the Fed is supposed to act independently of the executive branch. That's one of the reasons why the US dollar is the reserve currency of the world. There's always been a question of course, how independent is the Fed really. But there's always been a veil and that veil has just been lifted. And to be honest with you, I don't think it's good the Fed listening to the executive branch. The Fed needs to stay independent in my opinion. So how will this affect the markets? What comes next? Let's talk about it. So, this was actually reported by the New York Times first and then the Fed itself put out the video of Jerome Powell. And there's a strong argument that Jerome Powell intentionally waited until Sunday night to leak the news of the investigation to the New York Times. He likely did this to manipulate the stock market lower, which he knows is a sensitive point for Trump. We are watching a 3D chess get played here by both sides. None of this is good for the country. Now, who agrees with this? This environment is literally what Bitcoin was created for. The president is coming after the Fed chair. Metals are ripping as sovereigns diversify reserves. Stocks and risk assets are at record highs. Geopolitical risk is rising. If Bitcoin doesn't catch a bid soon, then I don't know. I mean, is it weird to you the lack of a pump that we're seeing? Bitcoin should have printed a god candle on the Fed attack. Let me give you my thoughts on what's happening and my outlook for 2026 real quick. I actually think Bitcoin makes a new all-time high in 2026 and the four-year cycle will be officially invalidated. However, before we get to the new all-time high, I think we have a lot of headwinds here in January and February and we need to get past three things before we can move forward."

Let me give you my thoughts on what's happening and my outlook for 2026 real quick. I actually think Bitcoin makes a new all-time high in 2026 and the four-year cycle will be officially invalidated. However, before we get to the new all-time high, I think we have a lot of headwinds here in January and February and we need to get past three things before we can move forward. These three things could cause Bitcoin to make a lower low in January or early February. that is possible. However, I think there's a lot of tailwinds into end of year and I am bullish. So, the three things that we need to watch out for in January and beginning of February are as follows. Number one, Fed shakeup. Trump is going to replace Jerome Powell this year and it might happen sooner rather than later. And that creates a lot of uncertainty, although the person they put in afterwards will be bullish for an easing cycle for the markets. Number two, government shutdown. You remember how detrimental the government shutdown was when it happened for a record amount of time last year? Well, unfortunately, the government's only open again until I think January 31st in which they will have to basically talk about reopening the government again. So, that's happening at the end of this month, a potential new government shutdown. Also, Supreme Court tariff decision comes this quarter. The Supreme Court will decide if Trump's tariffs are constitutional. I personally think if they say they're unconstitutional, that's going to be bullish for markets. But still leading into that, there's a lot of uncertainty. However, on the back half, the mid and back half of 2026, we have three big catalysts which are bullish. Going into the midterms, I think is bullish. The easing cycle, the business cycle, the Fed is lowering interest rates. I think is bullish. And then number three, the Clarity Act must get passed in these first two quarters. And that would be extremely bullish. If all of those things line up, if the bulls are right, I think Bitcoin could go for 180K sometime this year. My base case is just Bitcoin hitting 150K this year, still an all-time high. And my bare case, if we don't get an easing cycle, if the Clarity Act doesn't pass, I think Bitcoin could still kind of grind to an all-time high of about 130, but I don't think we're going to be seeing astronomical numbers in 2026 if we don't get the easing cycle and don't get the market structure bill. And reminder, the Bitcoin crypto market structure bill markup is this Thursday, January 15th. It's bullish that this markup is happening. It's part of the process. This has to happen for this eventually to get passed into law. So, the fact it's happening this Thursday is bullish. But will the Clarity Act pass before the midterms? It's big question right now. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson says if the Clarity Act doesn't pass this quarter, then I think David Sachs should resign. He's utterly failed us as an industry. So, I happen to agree that the Clarity Act needs to get passed before midterms because we just don't know if it we'll be able to get them passed after midterms because that will be a shakeup of representatives. Now, it's interesting how hard Charles Hoskinson is going on the Trump administration for crypto because I think the Trump administration has been a net positive for crypto clearly, but not perfect. There's a lot to critique and they do need to pass the Clarity Act for the administration to be seen as a success. But it's interesting how hard Charles goes. In this interview on the Wolf of Wall Street's podcast, Charles blames Trumpcoin for the ADA price being down. says David Saxs should be fired and that the Clarity Act probably won't happen. Is Charles right or is he underestimating the progress that has been made. Really interesting back and forth. Take a listen. But here's the reality of the situation. I don't think the Clarity Act is going to pass in this quarter."

I don't think the Clarity Act is going to pass in this quarter. And because it's an election year, we only have one left window and if the Democrats retake the House, we will not have another opportunity till 2029. If it doesn't pass this quarter, I think um Sachs should resign. He's utterly failed us as an industry. We we look at three lenses. The price going up, no. Adoption going up, no. You know, do we have clarity and certainty? And do we have a strong foundation to build on? No. So, if you're the ZAR and you're in charge of this whole thing, I got to judge you by your track record. Most cryptos are down 40 to 50% since Trump took office. So, I mean, the industry is unhealthy. >> Yeah. I guess the question is, how could he control what Trump did before he was even in office? The Trump token launched three days before, you know, Trump He was selected before uh Trump launched Trumpcoin. >> And what what he should have done is say, \"If you do this, I'm going to resign and publicly protest it and say, \"There's no path forward for us as an industry if you do this.\" Because here's the irony of it, man. Trump could have made two to three times as much money launching Trumpcoin under the new regulatory structure that just launching Trumpcoin. That's the up part of all this is he's so poorly advised by the people around him. if his goal is just extractive there, he could have made so much more money doing it after the framework because the new framework would have supercharged the markets and brought a lot of money into the markets and you're launching a coin into a bull market and also the Democrats can't complain because it's in full compliance with the framework they just voted for. So, we're going to keep you informed on what's most likely to come from the Fed this year. We're going to keep you informed on if the crypto market structure bill will pass. Now, good news here. It's breaking news. the SEC chair, Paul Atkins, very pro crypto. First of all, he says it remains to be seen if the US takes Venezuela's reported 60 million in Bitcoin. That's really what they want to hear from him. Will you take Venezuela's Bitcoin? He pivots the conversation and says what he's focused on is the crypto market structure bill. And I think this is a good thing. Venezuela has a Bitcoin stash worth about $60 billion. The chair of the SEC, Paul Atkins, joins me now. Mr. chairman, what's going to happen to those bitcoins? >> Oh, well, that remains to be seen. I think uh you know, this whole operation has been amazing. Uh the president and uh Secretary Rubio and then the brave uh service uh people in our armed forces have done a really spectacular job to try to help uh bring uh peace and liberty uh and and prosperity to the people of Venezuela and then obviously safety to the American people. So, you trying to take those Bitcoin off them? >> Well, I mean that I I leave that to uh others in the administration to deal with. That's I'm not involved with that. I'm focused really this week is an important week because the Senate's going to be taking up a bill. Um it's a bipartisan bill, but which will bring clarity and certainty to uh the crypto world and as to the division of uh responsibility between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. So important week and it'll it'll set the tone for the the rest of the year I think. >> Can you can you tell me about stable coin? >> It's really interesting that the professionals 5 trillion Fidelity Investments says Bitcoin may be entering a super cycle. I love that they bring charts."

I love that they bring charts. They're very bullish on Bitcoin and crypto. Let me play you just 60 seconds of this. >> Traditionally, what we have seen is Bitcoin has has had this fouryear cycle. >> Mhm. And that fouryear cycle has been highly correlated to Bitcoin's having events. So in 2016, if you go 10 years ago, in 2016 you had a having 17 months after you had peak price of Bitcoin in December 2017 when it hit around 20,000. Similarly, in 2020, you had another having event and then 18 months after in, you know, in 2021, you had another peak price for Bitcoin, >> right? So some might say that you had the last having in April 2024. So maybe we are past that peak price. But again on the other side you're also seeing a lot of arguments around how we might have entered into a super cycle as opposed to what we have seen in the past of four years. >> And what a super cycle really means is you might have more prolonged highs, longer highs and shallower dips. And I want to give a shout out to Fidelity digital assets research team which talks about the super cycle mechanism and and we might see something similar that we have seen in the commodities market in the 2000s and that's dictated by three big factors. one is you're seeing this steady buy in by institutions focused on ETPs in the domestic market especially in the US you're seeing proc crypto policies and then the third which I'm really excited to talk about is we also seeing how the crypto market as a whole is maturing and deviating from the S&P 500 and precious metals so that's >> again my friends we have never seen something like this before I think if Bitcoin can make it through January and first half of February, it's possible we make a lower low. If we hit 75K, that would be a 40% correction from the uh top last year. That's on the table right now. But if we can get past January, February, the Fed shakeup, the tariff decision, the government shutdown, if we can get past all of that, I do think there are a lot of bullish catalysts this year for crypto. Guys, make sure you subscribe to Altcoin Daily. And more than that, guys, make sure you follow us on Twitter. We're literally like 1,000 followers away from hitting two million followers on Twitter. I want you to be a part of this with us. And I will leave you with this clip. Bullish, water is wet. I mean, Michael Sailor says, \"I think 2026 will be a great year for Bitcoin.\" You know what's crazy? I tend to agree with him. You're like, \"Well, the four-ear cycle is dead.\" Well, the irony is the people that are saying that haven't waited four years. like we've only been 95 days since the peak of the cycle. >> Okay. So, how about I think that if you actually assess Bitcoin's performance on a rolling four-year uh moving average, you see a a progression that looks pretty bullish. I think I think 2026 is going to be a great year for Bitcoin."
