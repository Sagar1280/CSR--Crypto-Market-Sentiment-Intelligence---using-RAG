      "text": "A line has been crossed that has never been crossed before. The Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. Now, at the core of the investigation is a multi-billion dollar renovation project at the Federal Reserve. According to them, apparently there are some inconsistencies with what Powell has said and some of the earlier internal planning documents. Now, Jerome Powell has retorted on Sunday night and said this is actually about interest rates. Now, it is no surprise that the current administration would like interest rates to be lower than they currently are. In fact, essentially all administrations would like interest rates to be lowered as it generally does help out with growth. But what I want to do is talk about this, which is very unlike what we normally do on this channel. On this channel, we normally do not cover the news cycle, but something like this does warrant, in my opinion, some discussion. So, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to listen to what Jerome Powell had to say. So, go ahead and listen in. >> Good evening. On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings. I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role. The Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president. This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation. I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. >> So, I think you generally get the idea, right? He speaks a little bit longer, but you see what he's he's trying to say. What's essentially happening is are we at the point where there's no longer even the veil of independence by the Federal Reserve?

What's essentially happening is are we at the point where there's no longer even the veil of independence by the Federal Reserve? Has it always just been influenced by political pressures and now we're bringing that veil down? Now, I think what's interesting though is we have seen this coming from a mile away. It's not like this is completely out of the blue. Donald Trump has said that this was likely going to happen. and I think he's mentioned it a few times, but the pressure started building many many months ago. So, if you guys remember, there was also this other video and I'm going to show it to you as well right here where I'll let you listen in. You're including the market renovation. You just add >> you just you just added in a third building is what that is. It's a third building. >> No, it's it's a building that's being built. >> No, it's been it was built 5 years ago. We finished more than 5 years ago. It's >> part of the overall. >> So, uh so we're going to take a look. >> So, you guys can see the tension has been building, right? The tension has been building between them and now it has led to a criminal investigation. Now, I want to be clear. This is not yet criminal charges. There is not an indictment, but an indictment has been threatened. So, we will see how this ultimately plays out. Now, I want to show you guys a chart, right? This is the chart of interest rates. So, we're going to take a look at this chart. You can see this chart shows us interest rates and essentially where they've been for the last several years. You can see that for the last few years, interest rates went up in 2022 and 2023. They held steady and they've been coming back down. Now, the president wants rates to come down quicker, a lot quicker. Jerome Powell is saying, \"Hold on a second. We cannot continue to bring them down as quickly as you may want.\" In fact, if you were to go look at CME Group and look at the probability of a rate cut at the January meeting, which is only a couple of weeks away, there's a 95% chance the Fed does not cut rates. In fact, there is a higher probability that rates stay constant until June getting another rate cut. The reason why this is important is because Jerome Pal's tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve actually will come"

In fact, there is a higher probability that rates stay constant until June getting another rate cut. The reason why this is important is because Jerome Pal's tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve actually will come to an end in May. So the reason why this is important is because Powell is likely on the way out relatively soon as chair of the Federal Reserve. Now that doesn't mean he won't be able to stay on in some fashion. I think he has the ability to stay on until 2028. if he so chooses. But this is the issue. The administration wants rates to come down. The Federal Reserve says, \"Hold on. We can't do that.\" Now, you should we should be clear. Powell does not control rates by himself. There are 12 voting members of the Federal Reserve. So, we cannot pretend like Powell is the one who gets to dictate where interest rates are. It is true that he likely does have a lot of influence. I think that would be fair to say. So when you look at it, I think you can actually see why both sides are frustrated, right? I mean, it it it kind of makes sense. I think Powell is frustrated because they want to be seen as separate from the administration, as having autonomy and not bowing down to political pressures. that is what ultimately they would like. I think Pal is worried that there's going to be some type of residual spike with inflation, but that worry has been stated for about a year now and we haven't really seen that spike happen. Now, on the other side of things, if you look at what's going on over in the macro, the unemployment rate has been trending up, right? Like we know the unemployment rate has been trending up. If you go look at it here, it's been moving higher. And if you're the current administration, you're probably looking at this and thinking like, we really need to lower rates because the unemployment rate has risen from about 3.4%. To now 4.4%. The reason why this is interesting is because the unemployment rate is going up and layoffs haven't even really started yet. If you look at layoffs, they're still relatively low. They're still relatively low. Job openings are relatively low, right? There's not a lot of activity in the labor market for people to find jobs. It's just that the people that already have jobs aren't really getting laid off in mass at this point. So, of course, the current administration is saying, \"Look, we want"

It's just that the people that already have jobs aren't really getting laid off in mass at this point. So, of course, the current administration is saying, \"Look, we want to get ahead of this thing and we need to get interest rates down, right? We need to get them lower.\" Jerome Powell is saying, \"Look, we've already lowered interest rates. We need to give it time and and see kind of how that propagates through to the economy.\" Now, it is true the Federal Reserve is a reactionary body. Often times what happens, we get hard landings and the reason for that typically is because the Federal Reserve has to act on data that came in a long time ago, right? But it takes a long time to get that data. So they'll be reacting on data, but it takes months and months and months to get data. So by the time they react, you could already argue it's too late. Now, it's not as simple as that. If you remember in 2022 when the Federal Reserve was raising rates and the stock market was in a bare market and crypto was dropping, a lot of people thought the Federal Reserve was killing the economy back then when they raised rates to 5 a.5%. But guess what? It did not kill the economy. In fact, the recent estimate of GDP in the United States was over 5% according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve. So, it's a tough place to be in. Do you continue to aggressively lower rates and risk inflation coming back? I don't think Pal wants to do that. He doesn't want inflation to spike just before he leaves as chair of the Federal Reserve. Trump wants him out as soon as possible so that he can get someone in there to try to lower rates. But again, even if Trump puts someone in there that's more dovish than than Powell, they still have to get the other voting members on board. So what's interesting is despite the fact that Powell is going to be replaced in May, more than likely, the market still only thinks we're going to get a rate cut by June, right? the market still thinks there's a higher chance the Fed keeps rates where they are than lowering them until Jerome Powell is out as chair of the Federal Reserve. So, this has set up somewhat of an interesting dynamic where I imagine this is going to make Pal less likely to cut rates now because of course everything's been made more"

So, this has set up somewhat of an interesting dynamic where I imagine this is going to make Pal less likely to cut rates now because of course everything's been made more personal. So, now we have a situation where Pal doesn't want to cut rates. He already didn't want to cut them. He was somewhat worried about cutting them too much. He already said in December, in November, he told people that we shouldn't be assuming that we were going to have a rate cut in December. And we still got one. Now that this has happened, I doubt they're going to be cutting anytime soon. Only if something really, really bad happens. So, this is a tough spot to be in because it starts to call into question the independence of the Federal Reserve. Should they bow down to political pressure or should they make their own choices? Furthermore, does the administration have a point that the unemployment rate is trending up? Job openings are trending down. The number of unemployed workers per available job is actually below one now, which is a metric that General Pal has frequently cited. It's easy for us to all want to be an armchair economist and tell the Fed how they need to do their job. Please remember in 2023, 2022, 2023, and 2024, people were screaming to lower rates throughout that entire time and the US economy continued to expand. So, it's always easier said than done. The other difficult part of all this is that the yield curve was uninverted for a while. It uninverted a while back. And usually what happens after uninverted yield curves are recessions. So, it's true that the current administration might be somewhat justified in worrying about continued economic weakness. Now, I don't think they're going to come out and say that they're worried about that as much because they want to show that it's a strong economy, but deep down when you when we have inverted yield curves, it has always led to a recession. Always. It's just a matter of time. You can even look here at Treasury yield spreads and see historically whenever the yield curve becomes uninverted when it goes from less than zero to above zero that is when recessions occur. So right now it has uninverted we have kind of entered that window where it might happen. Now it doesn't have to happen immediately. Sometimes it takes 6 months. There have been times where it took 2 years before the recession happened. Right? 1967 is a great example. So it"

There have been times where it took 2 years before the recession happened. Right? 1967 is a great example. So it doesn't always happen immediately, but there is some justification for worrying about it. And when you look at interest rates, they are still elevated relative to something like the 2-year yield, which maybe we could approximate as the neutral rate. So the stakes have gone up. A line has been crossed that has never been crossed before. I think the tensions are only going to go up. Unfortunately, it will likely eventually lead to a larger drop in the stock market, but I would not recommend trying to be a hero and predicting exactly when that's going to happen because markets love climbing the wall of worry. Just know markets though do not like uncertainty. And if anything, this does start to increase the amount of uncertainty in the markets. So, be on the watch for this narrative that has recently started and let's see how it starts to affect markets over the coming months. Thank you guys for tuning in. Make sure you subscribe and I'll see you next time. Bye."
