      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coin Bureau Trading. Today, we're going to talk about why ETH is about to explode and why altcoins are next. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different. And if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, I want to start off guys with this path to altcoin season chart, which some of you may have seen, maybe some of you haven't seen it, but it's a chart that was circulating quite a bit, let's say, a couple of years ago. It's one that a lot of people have forgotten. And I want you guys just to forget for two seconds. Just forget about the four-year cycle for two seconds and just look at this path to altcoin season chart and ask yourself, where are we in this chart? Uh, I would argue that we're somewhere around phase two, maybe in this phase overlap between phase one uh and phase 2, which is where you see capital rotating from Bitcoin into Ethereum. And if you need proof of that, guys, look at the ETHB BTC chart, which of course measures Ethereum strength against Bitcoin. You can see that the ETHBTC chart has been in a long-term uptrend since April of last year. So, it's been about, I guess, whatever it is, 8 months, 7 months here of ETHBTC gradually rising higher. Of course, there was a draw down in ETHBTC uh going from August uh into late last year. But you can see over the last couple of weeks actually since November we've started to see ETHB BTC pick up again which is really interesting uh because that suggests again that we are kind of in somewhere in this uh you know in this transition either transitional phase or entering phase two here with Ethereum and of course that begs the question of you know what what would the catalyst for that be? Of course there are many but I would say that the main one here guys is the Clarity Act which is going to be voted on by the Senate next week. Uh, and if you guys remember, I've been mentioning this in a lot of videos, is that leading up to the passing of the Genius Act over last summer. Uh, that was basically what caused Ethereum to rally. That was what caused ETHBTC to rally here. This huge rally you see here in June going into August of ETHBTC and also ETH's price. This whole rally here was driven by the um by the Genius Act being passed and even leading up to the Genius Act being passed and afterwards. Uh and of course uh because uh Ethereum is the cho top chain here for tokenized RWAS and of course tokenized RWAS. That's kind of like the main uh focus here for the Clarity Act. The whole reason why they're doing the Clarity Act is to kind of open the door to tokenized assets, especially tokenized real world assets. And again, Ethereum is the largest chain here for tokenized RWAS by a large margin, which is also the case when it comes to stable coins. Ethereum is the largest uh chain for stable coins, which is why it's no surprise that Ethereum uh versus Bitcoin started rallying a lot around that time. And I suspect we're going to see a similar breakout here in ETH BTC. And you can see what that looked like for ETH's price last summer. ETH went up by around 50% over the course of a month. Some of you guys might remember that. It was a pretty crazy rally. And as crazy as it sounds, I think we could see a repeat of that because again, the Clarity Act is very similar to the Genius Act. The Genius Act was for stable coins. The Clarity Act is for the crypto market as a whole. again with a focus on tokenized RWAS. That's kind of like the underlying motivation behind the Clarity Act. And again, Ethereum is the top chain for tokenized RWAS by value here by quite a quite a big margin. Ethereum in first at 13 billion and then we have BNB at second in second place at just 2 billion. Uh so, you know, quite a big margin there."

Uh so, you know, quite a big margin there. And what a lot of people forget guys is when you're looking at a chart like like ETHBTC, what you're looking at is two assets. In this case, Ethereum and Bitcoin. So, if you want to figure out the direction of where ETHBTC is going to go, it's not enough to say that, oh, there's going to be this Clarity Act that's going to push up ETH relative to Bitcoin. We also have to ask what are the factors that are going to be driving Bitcoin here in the coming weeks. One that a lot of people have been overlooking is the fact that a lot of Bitcoin miners have been starting to sell Bitcoin either because they're, you know, getting squeezed by rising energy costs or because they're looking to pivot into AI. And this is something I think is overlooked. Everyone has been focused, you know, panicking over like Bitcoin treasury companies, panicking over like MSEI exclusion and all this type of stuff and like, you know, whether Micro Strategy would be forced to dump Bitcoin. But meanwhile, uh, Bitcoin miners have started selling Bitcoin quite aggressively here, selling hundreds of millions of dollars over the last couple of months. This is just from Riot platforms. There's others that have been selling as well. And then at the same time, of course, we've seen Bitine uh, and some, I guess, a little bit of a backstory here. Of course, Bitmine is the largest uh, Ethereum treasury company. they've been accumulating, you know, massive amounts of Ethereum over the last 30 days. But not only that, but a lot of these other Ethereum treasury companies, they have yet to basically raise, I guess, or in the rather they're still in the process of raising capital to buy more ETH. So, you can think of like, you know, these Ethereum treasury companies kind of being like in the let's say early stages relative uh to what we saw with the Bitcoin treasury companies. And you could make the argument that, you know, some like a company like Micro Strategy, yes, they've accumulated, you know, tens of billions of dollars with Bitcoin, but that accumulation is done. But when it comes to these Ethereum treasury companies, that accumulation is just getting started because again, a lot of these companies are still raising ETH. They're still doing stuff with that ETH. Uh, and so that suggests, you know, assuming history kind of repeats, or rather, if we see Ethereum kind of following Bitcoin in the sense, then these Ethereum treasury companies will be a huge tailwind. uh you know beyond the Clarity Act you'll see basically this constant bid from these Ethereum treasury companies of course you have the staked Ethereum ETFs which I believe are still coming or some of them have already been launched you guys might have heard I I think it's the Black Bronck one that's still coming you guys might have heard that I think the Grayscale spot uh Ethereum ETF sorry staked Ethereum ETF paid out its first yield a few days ago. So, there's going to be a basically more uh you could say you could say institutional demand when the Clarity Act is passed because not only are there all these uh Ethereum treasury companies that are buying, but you're also going to have a lot of institutions buying through these ETFs, which again now offer staking, which is an added bonus that the that the Bitcoin ETFs do not have. Uh so, that's going to be really interesting there. And, you know, combine all these things together. Clarity Act basically pushing up Ethereum uh Bitcoin minor selling, which is kind of putting a sell pressure on Bitcoin. You have Ethereum treasury companies that are accumulating plus uh institutions being able to b to buy and stake Ethereum through the staked Ethereum ETFs."

Uh I think that there's going to be a lot of uh of basically buying pressure for Ethereum here in the coming weeks. And I do think that we could see a massive rally similar to what we saw in the summer of 2025. And again, assuming history repeats that once Ethereum gets this massive rally, then we would start to get more basically money flow into other altcoins. But of course, we'll have to take things one step at a time in that sense. And to wrap things up guys, I want to kind of show you this really interesting chart because of course that begs a question of like how high would ETHBTC go. We can kind of use this as a means of calculating, you know, how high Ethereum could go here in the next couple of weeks, next couple of months. Um, so this is a really long-term chart of ETHBTC on the monthly. It actually comes from Kraken and you can see it goes all the way back to 2015. If you look on like ETBTC charts, whether it's on Bit or Binance or all these other exchanges, they don't go back that far. they typically just go back, you know, whatever it is to 2016 or 2017. Most charts do not show that full history. And it's really interesting because I actually think, and you know, feel free to roast me in the comments or, you know, um, you know, give your own opinion here. I think that what we're seeing here, uh, you know, this kind of like it looks like we're about to see a huge breakout on the monthly. You can see that here if we zoom in, ETHBTC is about to break above this key resistance level on the monthly. Looks like it's about to go vertical. And yes, the target, I guess, at TLDDR, the target would be around 0.055, 055 which is roughly 50% higher uh from where Ethereum is today. What that means in in practical terms is that if Bitcoin's price was to stay exactly where it is right now than Ethereum's price would increase by roughly 50% so somewhere to around I think it's like 5,200 or something like that off the top of my head. Um but of course it's pro it's probable that Bitcoin's price will also rise in the coming weeks. How high is is Bitcoin going to go? I don't know. But you could say that, you know, as a as an ultra-conservative estimate, if Bitcoin stays roughly where it is and we get all these tailwinds for Ethereum, that Ethereum's price would rise somewhere to around $5,000 in the coming weeks as a result of the Clarity Act, as a result of accumulation by Ethereum Treasury companies and so on. But with that being said, I guess to go back to the original thing I was saying here is that this pattern that we're seeing here, uh, in my mind looks really similar. It's almost like the inverse of what we saw in 2016. So, I would say that we're, you know, if you're kind of looking at looking at this, like if you were looking at a kind of mirror, uh, you would say that the pattern that we're seeing right now is similar to the one that we saw, uh, basically in August and September of of 2016, but kind of like in reverse. And that means that we're going to see a nice kind of like a shoot up here in the next couple of months in ETHBTC heading somewhere to around the 0.05, maybe 0.055 range, right? Uh and then after that we would actually see a collapse lower uh in u in ETHBTC uh heading into lows not seen basically for for over a decade uh you know not since 2015."

And again this is just speculation on my part. Just like a little fun thing to add in close to the end of the video. But again the TLDDR is that if we just look at what's going on in the crypto market through the lens of this you know path to altcoin season rotation it's quite clear that we're enter we're somewhere either in phase two or entering phase two. This is clear because you can see that ETHBTC has been having a higher high or higher lows um ever since uh the spring of 2025 or since April. And you can see that ETH BTC looks like it's about to break out here on the weekly. We can also see that on the monthly here on the monthly chart which is pretty crazy. We have the Clarity Act which is coming up here soon which is likely to be a catalyst similarly to how the Genius Act was which caused Ethereum's price to explode higher by 50% in one month and ETHBTC also exploded higher here. uh it nearly doubled over the course of a month, which is pretty crazy. At the same time, we have Bitcoin miners that are probably going to be selling BTC, which is also going to kind of boost the ETHBTC pair. It's like selling pressure on Bitcoin while there's buying pressure on Ethereum. Uh not just because of the Clarity Act, but also because of these Ethereum Treasury companies. Um yeah, guys, apologies for the repetition. I'm still kind of getting uh back into it. But with that being said, if you are looking to trade Ethereum here in the next couple of days, uh then do check out the links in the description, especially this first link here. Bit up to 50,000 USDT deposit bonus, when you click on that link, it'll take you to a page that looks like this. You guys will notice that the Coin Bureau does have a partnership with BitGet. But on a personal note, I think BitGet is an awesome exchange. It's one that I use personally. It's one I would definitely recommend. That does not mean that you should be keeping your crypto on Bit. Always keep your crypto on your personal self-custodial wallet. Uh with that being said, BitGet doesn't just offer futures. You know, everyone just assumes that these exchanges offer futures. No, they offer spot trading. They offer tokenized stocks. They offer um uh what is onchain trading. They offer like AI trading. A whole bunch of different features. And it's completely free to make an account. So, just make an account, try out these features, see if you like them. And if you do, then with some luck, you'll get enough trading volume to get these bonuses, which again are up to 50,000 USDT. Uh, and if you guys did make it this far and you did find that information helpful, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, ding that notification bell, and I'll see you in the next"
