      "text": "It's official. The biggest piece of crypto legislation in history progresses this week. It's the Clarity Act, the Market Structure Bill, and as of yesterday, the full 278 page bipartisan text that has been the product of months of fraught negotiations between Senate Republicans, Democrats, and the industry has landed. This bill is going to cement the US as the center of innovation in the digital asset space for the next generation of the internet. The web 3 revolution is truly here. And the language in this bill today affects you if you hold crypto, especially if you hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, of course, but also XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and more. This is everything you need to know as a crypto holder. Click subscribe to Altcoin Daily for an edge investing in crypto with one video per day keeping you informed. Here's White House official Patrick Wit, who is the person in the know, the executive director on the President's Council of Adviserss for Crypto, explaining that the crypto market structure bill for this Thursday is a go. >> As we were talking about a moment ago, you know, we have good momentum. There were a number there were, you know, call it 10 issues that were open issues and people were dug in and it didn't feel like we were going to be able to arrive at a compromise on any of them. And we've narrowed that down to, you know, call it two or three open issues. So, you know, the the success of closing out some of those seemingly impossible, you know, intractable uh differences of opinion, I think, you know, gives me more optimism that we're going to be able to close out the last few. So, we're moving in the right direction. and the trend is in a good uh good direction and uh I'm very optimistic for Thursday getting a successful vote and then we'll head to the floor and uh you know we'll we'll have more discussion and debates around some of these same issues as other voices you know start to uh interject and uh people that were off committee are now you know being asked to vote on something. So um a lot more to come but I am very encouraged by the work that's been done and the progress that we've made. So, it's important to understand that this vote on Thursday is not the final vote. It's a debate for a markup on the current Clarity Act bill for where it stands. And there's a few key issues that have been put into place that have been added in to the Clarity Act, which now some good, some bad, which now is what the debate is about. So, here's what's changed. The current crypto bill has elevated certain altcoins. So, not counting Bitcoin and ETH, but has elevated certain altcoins to Bitcoin and ETH status. Let me explain. Here's an interesting section giving some tokens classification as nonancilary assets based on their inclusion in exchange products as of January 1st, 2026. meaning any altcoin that was already in an ETF wrapper is getting a better status as I guess it's seen as compliant already. It says that if a token is the main asset of an ETF listed on a national securities exchange and is registered under section six of the securities exchange act as of January 1st. So only altcoins that have doesn't count if it just happened in the last two days. It has to have already had an ETF on the national exchange as of January 1st. As of January 1st, it will not be required to file disclosures that other tokens are required to file. And what does that mean for you if you hold the CERN altcoins? Well, in other words, under this bill, XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Hideera, HBar, Doge, and Chain Link are treated the same as Bitcoin and Ethereum from day one. So, if you hold those altcoins, that's bullish because the United States legislators are saying they have an elevated status versus the other altcoins which may have that status but have to file disclosures and have to apply for it. Basically, let me know what you think down below in the comments. But to me, this does make sense. If it's already offered on a n at a national level, regulated by the SEC section 6 in an ETF, then I understand why the Senate is saying you don't have to file disclosures. You already meet these the you've already met the requirements. I get that. Now, is this fair to the altcoins which do not have regulated ETPs or ETFs in the United States yet? like Cardano. Cardano does not meet the requirements yet because it doesn't have an ETF."

Cardano does not meet the requirements yet because it doesn't have an ETF. They'll just have to apply under these current legislative rule legislative rules if it gets passed. That's all being debated on Thursday. This current Clarity Act draft also curbs stable coin yield, giving banks a potential edge, meaning the banks, the big banks are still fighting the people on stable coin yield. Because the beauty of what cryptocurrency allows, it allows people to eliminate the middleman. So for example, in the current traditional finance system, if I want to earn yield, I have to deposit my money in a bank, put it into treasuries or bonds or something. It has to be done through the broker, through the bank, and then they will give the yield to me. Now, the beauty with stable coins is we can potentially eliminate those middlemen and just if I'm holding stable coins in my certain stable coins regulated in my wallet, why do I need the banks? I should just get that yield directly to me and I won't have to pay the banks, which again is why the banks don't like it. And the banks are fighting the people on this. So, this is currently in the bill now. Yield update. The banks may have won this round on stable coin yield. The draft page 189 says companies cannot pay interest just for holding balances. You can earn rewards but only if they're tied to opening an account or activity like making transactions, staking, providing liquidity, putting up collateral or participating in network governance. Essentially saying this little loophole saying you can earn rewards for doing things. We have rewards for credit cards today. So that's not new, but that's the only way you can earn. You can earn rewards, but you can't earn direct yield as it states today. Senators now have 48 hours to make amendments to this text. So unclear if the provision will stay the same for Thursday. So it's being debated on Thursday and senators can get in last week's for Thursday. It's a fight to the very bitter end. And I agree with this. The Clarity Act is the punksatonyy fill of this crypto winter. If it sticks his head out but fails in Congress, meaning we try to pass it but the banks still fight it, we can't reach an agreement and it fails in Congress, the crypto winter could continue. If instead it passes and is signed into law, we're headed to new all-time highs. Now, Altcoin Daily will continue to keep you updated step by step where we stand on the Clarity Act today. This is the timeline. It has been introduced. It has been passed by the House. Now, we're waiting on the Senate. We're the the markup is being debated this Thursday in the Senate. If the Senate passes, well, probably they'll change a few things. It gets pass back to the House. They have to approve. Senate has to approve. And then the president signs into law. This will essentially for the first time ever define clear rules in our industry. What's a security? What's a commodity? Is an altcoin sufficiently decentralized to be considered a commodity or is it controlled by a company? Is it meaning is it centralized? Should it be a security? We'll finally have answers. We'll also get specific regulatory oversight. What the SEC is in charge of, what the CFTC is in charge of. all to reduce uncertainty, protect investors, and keep crypto development on shore. This is crypto's 1996 moment. Just like in 1996 for the internet, the Telecommunications Act passed in Congress that ushered in the next many many years of the internet age finally able to flourish in America. There was before 1996 internet nothing memorable after 1996. the internet companies flourished. Millionaires, billionaires were made in that timeline. This is what's happening for crypto."

If you're wondering which altcoins this may affect most, what altcoins should I be looking at, I made my list of top six crypto altcoins. And not that there won't be dips, right? We could have a 20% dip tomorrow. That's normal in crypto. That's normal in crypto, especially if traditional markets stumble a little bit. But long term, think long term on what this is about to mean for our industry a decade from now, let alone a few years from now. My name's Austin. I will keep you updated. If you got value in today's video, I would really appreciate sharing this with a friend, right? Was their altcoin affected? H bar, XRP, what that means for those altcoins? Share it with a friend. Like the video. Like all see you tomorrow."
