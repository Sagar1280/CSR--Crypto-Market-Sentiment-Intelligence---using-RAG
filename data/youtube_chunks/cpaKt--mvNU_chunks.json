      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coinbau Trading. Today, we're going to talk about the collapse of the Japanese yen and what impact this could have on the crypto market. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different. And if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, as you guys might have heard or might have seen, the Japanese yen hasn't been doing so good in the last few years here. And what we're looking at here is the Japanese yen versus the US dollar going all the way back to the 1980s. And you can see that it's basically about to break below this key support level. Uh, and if it does, then the Japanese yen could, you know, not go to zero, but it could lose significantly more value than it already has. I'll actually do a quick measure here just off the top of my head. Uh, so the Japanese yen, guys, is down 35% since 2020. uh probably even a little bit more than that especially when you factor in that other currencies have lost their value as well. Uh, of course that begs the question, you know, what impact does this have on the crypto market, if at all? Well, it's a little bit complicated, guys, because I was trying to go back and like look at some correlations. Of course, you guys will know that I'm a huge fan of looking at the crypto market through the lens of the US dollar. And if you look historically speaking, basically the crypto bull market would happen during a period when the US dollar was falling. The bull market would kind of end around the time that the US dollar started strengthening. But again, in every single cycle, we would kind of see this, as I've mentioned many times before. We would see like a first leg lower in the US dollar, then we would have a couple months of chop, and then we have a second leg lower in the US dollar. And that second leg lower historically corresponded to an altcoin season, whereas that initial rally was kind of more focused on Bitcoin. That first leg lower in the DXY would uh translate to a rally in Bitcoin. And as you guys will know, the Japanese yen is a big component of the US dollar. I mean not not the biggest one but it's one of the main components because the US dollar index measures the strength of the US dollar against a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen. So it should come as no"

I mean not not the biggest one but it's one of the main components because the US dollar index measures the strength of the US dollar against a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen. So it should come as no surprise then that historically speaking when the Japanese yen would kind of see a gradual rise uh then this would actually translate to a rally in the crypto market uh because it would actually result in the US dollar going down which kind of makes debts around the world more affordable. Things get a little bit complicated here, guys, because as you know, uh, a rising Japanese yen is not necessarily good, especially when it's a sharp rise like we saw, for example, in the summer of 2024. And that's because of the yen carry trade. Uh, to quickly bring you up to speed, the yen carry trade is basically where institutions and investors around the world. They go to Japan, they borrow a bunch of Japanese yen because interest rates in Japan are low. Then they swap that Japanese yen into a foreign currency or into a foreign asset. uh to basically you typically done like the the traditional carry trade is that they borrow yen and then they swap to US dollars and then they buy US bonds and then US bonds are earning whatever it is 4% and then uh let's say the debt that they have to pay on the uh Japanese yen that they borrowed is maybe like 1 or 2% right so then that allows them to earn in theory like a spread of like 2% quote unquote risk-free but of course that assumes that that the value of the Japanese yen stays the same and that interest rates in Japan stay the same if interest rates in Japan rise or the Japanese yen rises then all of a sudden all those debts that they borrowed in Japanese yen, they have to start paying those back. And that basically results in foreign assets being sold, which is exactly why in the summer of 2024, we saw this kind of like yen carry trade unwind where the yen started spiking a lot. Uh and then all these investors who had done this carry trade. A lot of them basically had to sell assets all around the world to buy back yen kind of creates like this positive feedback loop or rather negative feedback loop for foreign assets. Um, contrary to popular belief, just before you freak out, the yen carry trade un like once it unwwind like over the summer of last uh well of"

Um, contrary to popular belief, just before you freak out, the yen carry trade un like once it unwwind like over the summer of last uh well of last year that carry trade is basically done. Uh not that it's done of course it's still going on but the risk of a of um of a of another unwind of that magnitude is basically gone. This is according to multiple like currency experts uh you know whether it's um I think it's Brent Donnelly off the top of my head. There's a couple other guys as well who worked with hedge funds and they've all been saying look like once that yen carry trade online happened over last summer. We're not at risk of seeing that again. But with that being said, of course, it isn't necessarily good that the Japanese yen, let's say if the Japanese yen was to spike or to double, then of course that would potentially at some point it would put pressure again on this yen carry trade. But it's not like, you know, another rally like we saw for example earlier this year in the Japanese yen. That's not really going to cause a yen carry trade. We would really have to see a big move higher. Um, so basically it's a long-winded way of saying guys that uh the Japanese yen is in this kind of tricky position where if it goes any lower then that's going to cause the US dollar to rise which would probably be bearish for the crypto market and the broader market. But at the same time if the Japanese yen was to spike higher then that would also potentially be bearish for the markets right because it could potentially again depending on the magnitude of that move uh the uh the Japanese yen could could in fact rise high enough to start triggering some more of these liquidations from the yen carry trade. So again, we're kind of in this interesting situation where if the Japanese yen if it goes up too quickly in the short term, uh then then basically the the global economy is in trouble and also potentially if it falls too much in the short term, then the global economy could also be in trouble again because that would cause the US dollar to rise. Um so again, it's like what what exactly is going to happen here? Well, in the short term, this is where things get even more complicated. Uh which is why I'm making this video. I think"

Um so again, it's like what what exactly is going to happen here? Well, in the short term, this is where things get even more complicated. Uh which is why I'm making this video. I think this is very fascinating stuff. uh basically of course the way that the bank of Japan that Japanese authorities can support the value of the Japanese yen uh is to basically intervene which basically involves let's say for example selling uh US dollar assets like US bonds and then uh swapping those US dollars for yen to basically prop up the yen's value and as you guys some of you guys might know uh the Japanese government and central bank actually have a lot of foreign currency reserves they have over well close to 1.4 trillion here apparently according to trading economics they have 1.4 4 trillion of foreign currencies reserves that they could use to defend the value of the Japanese yen if it was to start dropping too much. But the problem is there guys, of course, similarly to the yen carry trade. Again, it's like this again like it's you're almost like damned if you do, damned if you don't because whereas the yen carry trade can potentially unwind if the Japanese yen experiences a huge spike. If the Japanese yen does start falling aggressively here, then that forces the Japanese authorities to basically start selling US assets. Um and and that could also again crash the markets, right? Um, so it's this very interesting kind of dynamic where it's again, damned if you, damned if you don't. So what exactly is going on here? Um, and this is where things get, I guess, a little bit interesting. So at the surface level, this is actually a really interesting take from Michael How, if you guys follow, of course he's an expert in global liquidity. One thing that Michael has been pointing out a lot is that it's kind of strange that the Federal Reserve and that central banks around the world, they haven't really commented about the collapse of the Japanese yen. And this is really abnormal, guys, because when you see a currency drop by, it's a major currency, by the way. you know, when you see a major currency drop by 35%. That typically results in some kind of warning signals or even, for example, the United States, they don't like quote unquote currency manipulators. Um, they would basically allege that countries are weakening their currency such as China, right? They say China's artificially weakening their currency so they can be more competitive. But"

Um, they would basically allege that countries are weakening their currency such as China, right? They say China's artificially weakening their currency so they can be more competitive. But then when Japan values their currency by 35%, you don't hear any complaints from the United States. And you might say, \"Oh, it's just because they're a US ally.\" Well, Michael has a little bit of a different theory here. And his theory is basically that the uh the uh I guess the powers that be you could say the central banks of the United States and Japan are allowing the Japanese yen to weaken because this also puts pressure on the Chinese currency because again when the Japanese yen is going down it's kind of putting pressure on that on all those Asian currencies especially uh in China which is an interesting theory but I kind of have a let's say a little bit of a deeper one and you could say potentially a little bit more conspiratorial as you guys know Japan has the most debt of any country in the world. Uh they have 1.4 4 I think it's quadrillion yen or sorry 1.6 quadrillion or no sorry 1.4 1.4 quadrillion yen of debt roughly 1.4 4, 1.5, whatever, who's counting, right? Quadrillions. Um, and of course, when it comes to debt to GDP, this is where things get really interesting, guys. You guys might have heard, oh, Japan has the highest debt to GDP and whatever, which is true. And I I believe that's still the case. But what's interesting is that Japan's debt to GDP has actually been falling quite quickly here over the last 5 or 6 years. And that's not that surprising, guys, because when you consider when the Japanese yen basically collapses, that doesn't change necessarily the uh the size and strength of Japan's economy. All it means is that for example uh you know everything just kind of becomes well cheaper I guess you could say well not for the locals everything becomes more expensive um but relative to the economic production uh the basically the value of the yen has fallen and this in basically causes uh the debt to GDP to fall and so what you're basically seeing here guys is kind of like a you could say some would argue and I would definitely argue uh is that you're seeing kind of like a managed decline of the Japanese yen uh so that you can actually delever uh the Japanese not only that these yen carry trade Guys,"

But not only that guys, but again the Japanese government has quadrillions uh you know in yen debts and they need to find some way to devalue that. And of course one way to devalue is by basically devaluing the currency. So then these obligations become cheaper to pay off relative to the economic growth of the country. Um I hope that kind of makes sense. I know it's a little bit complicated, but the key takeaway is that I'm pretty sure for whatever reason this decline in the Japanese yen over the last couple of years has been managed. And it does look like potentially guys like that they're going to allow the Japanese yen to fall even further. Uh and if that was to happen, of course, that would create lots of problems for the uh for the Japanese people in terms of, you know, them losing some of their purchasing power. But at the same time, uh it would save the Japanese government and it would save, of course, all these um people who are doing the yen carry trade. They would basically not have to pay those debt backs. Uh and you could think of it, you know, if you really want to be conspiratorial, you could say the yen carry trade has become so big that there's no way for those debts to ever be paid back. So the only way to kind of fix it is to allow the yen to effectively go to zero. So then that way uh neither uh these foreign investors nor the Japanese government needs to worry about paying down their debts. Basically the value of the debt becomes worthless because the currency has has gone close to zero. I know it's a little bit speculative but it is super fascinating to consider and again what would that mean for for crypto for the crypto market. I think it would potentially be bad in the short term again because it would if the Japanese yen is to continue weakening if I'm correct that this is kind of like a managed decline of the Japanese yen then that could potentially put pressure on the crypto market and you could make the argument that that could be why the crypto market"

That's something I've been waiting for now uh since the uh basically since the spring of this year. As you guys can see, it hasn't happened yet. And who knows, maybe this whole pattern here is actually a bottoming pattern and we're going to see the US dollar start to turn higher potentially as a result of the Japanese yen collapsing. If that happens and the crypto cycle is probably over. Um but I'm hoping here in the short term that, you know, the Japanese can kind of keep their their stuff together. Um but again, we're going to have to wait and see. TLDDR there is that it looks like the Japanese yen is going to continue falling because the the Japanese need to devalue their debt and possibly foreign investors who have trillions in these um Japanese yen carry trade loans. They also want their debts kind of like to be devalued so it's easier to pay back. But that's going to push the dollar higher and that's potentially going to put pressure on the markets including the crypto market as the dollar already has over the last couple of months here. Um so yeah, it's going to be really interesting to watch. Um, but hopefully this doesn't happen anytime soon and we still have enough just for clarity before anyone asks. I still do think that Q1 is going to be bullish for the crypto market. Uh, you know, this collapse in the Japanese yen we're looking at here on the weekly. It's not going to happen overnight. If it does begin here, it would take at least a few months. So maybe going into the spring or the summer, that could be one of the catalysts that causes the crypto market to fall, which is actually what I'm expecting to happen uh in the spring and summer of this year.
