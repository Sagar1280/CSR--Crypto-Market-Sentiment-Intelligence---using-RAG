      "text": "Here's something that shouldn't really happen. A public AI agent appears online and starts talking about ideas that later show up in a confidential investor letter. And instead of being shut down, it's quietly tolerated. In this video, we're going to walk through documents, on-chain data, and observable behavior, separating what we can verify from what we can't. And by the end, you can decide whether this is just a coincidence or did the best fintech firm of the last 15 years stealth launch a little frog meme. This video is for information and entertainment only. It reflects my personal opinions and is not financial advice. Check the description for more information. Always do your own research. To fully understand why this is even worth looking at, we first have to understand who this VC firm is. Ribbit Capital. Ribbit is not a crypto fund. They're one of the most important fintech venture firms in the last 15 years. They were early in Stripe, Coinbase, Nubank, Revolut. The list is stacked. Just check it out. Their focus has always been financial infrastructure. Stuff like payments, identity, compliance, rails, trust. And importantly, Ribbit has a long history of building very quietly. They don't announce ideas early. They don't hype experiments. They let things exist before they explain them. Ribbit's co-founder Micky Malka has been consistent about one thing for decades. He tends to focus less on products and more on systems. He bought Bitcoin early but not as a trade. He bought it because he was interested in what programmable money could become. He backed Robinhood before it worked and saved them when they almost died, and he focused on access to finance long before it became fashionable to do so. It helps to understand the kind of long-term thinking this firm, and especially Micky, are known for. Micky has been consistent on one idea for years: Money on its own is not enough. But for the next decade, money without knowledge is not money. It's not valuable anymore. What do you mean by that? If money has no knowledge of what it's doing, it has no smart contract. It has no rules. It has no decision tree that was made to move it from one place to another. It doesn't hold that information. It's not valuable. What matters is money plus decision-making. And that framing shows up again and again in Ribbit's investments. And if you follow the logic all the way through, the natural endpoint isn't apps, it's agents. And that's the direction of travel Micky has been openly talking about for years. One of the first questions people always ask when they see this story: If it's real, why wouldn't Ribbit just say it? And the answer is simple. Stealth is normal for Ribbit. They've repeatedly backed companies that stayed private early, avoided hype, and only surfaced once the infrastructure was ready. It isn't secrecy for fun. It's protection. Protection from being copied, premature regulation, and the story"

And the answer is simple. Stealth is normal for Ribbit. They've repeatedly backed companies that stayed private early, avoided hype, and only surfaced once the infrastructure was ready. It isn't secrecy for fun. It's protection. Protection from being copied, premature regulation, and the story outrunning the product. Underpinning everything that follows is a document that Ribbit circulated in 2024, and it's known as the Identity Letter. The letter isn't the story in and of itself. It's the foundation for understanding Ribbit's worldview. Without it, nothing else in this investigation makes sense. At the time, it was confidential, shared privately with partners and LPs. And three ideas run through the entire document. First, identity comes before access. Today, you log in with your usernames and your passwords. Ribbit's view is that this breaks down at scale. Instead, systems ask, \"Who are you? What can you prove? And what are you authorized to do?\" Access becomes automatic based on credentials, not login. Second, software begins to act on your behalf. Right now, you manually click buttons. Ribbit's view is that this changes. You set rules once and software executes decisions for you. Paying bills, booking flights, moving money, running checks. You're not involved every time. The system acts with permissions you've already approved. Third, infrastructure matters more than interfaces. Most people focus on apps, what things look like. Ribbit focuses on what sits underneath: permissions, enforcements, settlement. Those invisible systems matter more than the screen you tap. And that's where Ribbit invests. This letter is Ribbit explaining how the world has to work before any products can exist. And crucially, it exists before anything else in the story. There is one more factual detail that sits alongside the Identity Letter. In US SEC filings, an entity named Tibbir Trust appears as a reporting holder. Now, these filings are not commentary or marketing material. They're formal disclosures required under US securities laws. In those disclosures, Tibbir Trust is listed as holding equity in Robinhood alongside other Ribbit-related entities. So, these filings specify (a) the existence of the trust, (b) its status as a reporting entity, and (c) its ownership of publicly listed shares. It's the fact that Tibbir is the name of a real pre-existing legal entity used in regulated disclosures connected to Ribbit's ecosystem. After the Identity Letter had been circulating, an AI agent appears publicly launched on a platform called Virtuals. Virtuals is a platform where agents are deployed as an entire system. So an agent is launched with a token and it's launched with a Twitter account that the agent controls. In this case, the agent is called Tibbir, and it posts publicly on"

So an agent is launched with a token and it's launched with a Twitter account that the agent controls. In this case, the agent is called Tibbir, and it posts publicly on Twitter under the Twitter handle Ribbit A20. From the outside, the agent is not presented as being part of Ribbit. There's no branding, no claim of affiliation. There's no hype. There's no token promotion. And at this stage, there's nothing really to suggest that Ribbit is behind this. All we can say factually is that the agent appears after the Identity Letter. It posts publicly to Twitter and its language closely mirrors the kind of systems thinking Ribbit had already laid out internally. That alignment on its own doesn't prove anything. Maybe it got hold of the confidential Identity Letter and started circulating the information. But looking deeper, there seems to be an on-chain footprint that connects Micky and the agent. Everything we've looked at could be coincidence. But the beauty of blockchain is that everything is verifiable. When you look at the wallet associated with a Tibbir agent deployment, one thing clearly stands out. This wallet was directly funded by Micky Malka. Now, that fact alone doesn't prove who controls Micky Malka. ENS names are not legal entities, and we should be careful with assumptions. So, instead of guessing, we can just follow where that wallet actually goes. The ENS name for Micky Malka is part of the same on-chain cluster as Canvas. And Canvas controls a vault called Canvas Vault. And vault ENSs are typically used to hold high-value assets, right? And if we look inside this vault, we can see the CryptoPunk that Micky Malka uses as his PFP is inside this vault. The vault's also got an additional 25 other CryptoPunks. Just as an aside, Micky Malka actually owns the CryptoPunk IP via a nonprofit organization called Node. They acquired them off Yuga Labs. Just know that Micky Malka really likes Punks. He really likes art. He really likes Punks. Just quickly guys, I want to tell you about Easy Bitcoin. This segment is sponsored by Easy Bitcoin.

In 2025, Ribbit circulated another document. This one called the Token Letter. Like the Identity Letter, this document was confidential at the time, shared privately with LPs before any public release. Unlike the Identity Letter, this one wasn't abstract. It describes specific mechanics: how agents are instantiated, how tokens attach to agents, how identity, memory, and expertise are represented, and how trust and permissions are enforced programmatically. Before the Token Letter was distributed to the LPs, the Tibbir agent was already posting ideas that closely tracked the same mechanisms. It even told us Coinbase would be listing tokenized stocks back in February. I mean, how did it know that? It spoke about the one key theme in Ribbit's Token Letter well before it was public knowledge: Token Factories. A key theme that underpins all Ribbit's plans with tokenization. After the timing anomaly, the agent moves from language to action. The Tibbir agent used its funds that it made from people trading the token. It had about a million dollars sitting in one account, the LP account. It used a portion of those funds to buy a CryptoPunk. CryptoPunks are one of the earliest and most recognizable forms of on-chain identity. Obviously, it's well known Micky Malka values Punks. He literally owns the IP. And after the Punk purchase, the agent issued a soulbound NFT to all Tibbir holders. This NFT can't be transferred. It's not tradable. And it existed to commemorate the agent's identity selection. The mint used infrastructure provided by Crossmint, a Ribbit Capital portfolio company. And this matters, right? Because if the agent had been fake, misleading, or problematic, you would reasonably expect some distance. Instead, the infrastructure was used and the mint proceeded. The mint also drew a bunch of public reaction. Ever Alonzo from Ribbit Capital reacted to it publicly. Now, this agent is actually followed by basically everybody inside Ribbit Capital.

The mint also drew a bunch of public reaction. Ever Alonzo from Ribbit Capital reacted to it publicly. Now, this agent is actually followed by basically everybody inside Ribbit Capital. A few months ago, Ribbit wiped their public presence clean. They overhauled their entire website and deleted every single old tweet. And the new site introduced two symbols that immediately stood out. The first was a silver coin. If we inspect the webpage, we can see that this is called Ribbitcoin. And visually, it looks almost identical to the NFT that had already been issued to Tibbir holders by the agent. It's the same form, same color, same structure. It just looks like the other face of the coin. Now, it's not identical. It can easily be a mistake. It almost looks like two sides of the same object. The NFT came first. The website imagery came later. The second change was a little more subtle. Ribbit introduced a backwards \"R\" into its visual language. No claim being made again, but people notice that Tibbir is simply Ribbit spelled backwards. And the reversed \"R\" suddenly feels like, oh, you can literally read \"Tibbir\" inside their website in the top right-hand corner. So, just this week, Ribbit released a brand new four-part promo video. And in this video, it looks like there's a bunch of Easter eggs that have been left. Again, I'm going to show you what they are. Make up your own mind as to whether or not they are actual Easter eggs or just random coincidences. The story follows a girl traveling on a train from destination to destination. Now, quite clearly, this train is representing rails, but you've got a girl carrying credentials, moving on this train from destination to destination with credentials. Each destination is a Ribbit Capital portfolio company and the rails are linking all of these companies together. In the middle of this infrastructure, the rails that connect it all is a frog. Who knows what that means? But you've got a girl carrying credentials, probably mimicking the fact that agents are going to be traveling across these rails with the credentials of the client that they are acting on behalf of. It's just a clear example of Ribbit saying, \"We are building infrastructure that underpins our major portfolio companies and we see the future of finance.\" This isn't saying Tibbir is that infrastructure. It's saying Ribbit is building it. Now in this video as well, as I said, there are a few Easter eggs. The original frog that was used as the agent's PFP, and is still actually in the banner, is right here."

Now, this is the coin on their website. Unfortunately, this isn't actually the NFT coin. And obviously, there's this frog that sits in the middle of the infrastructure rails. Again, none of this proves or confirms intent. It doesn't prove ownership. But these signals aren't coming from an agent. They're not coming from potentially ambiguous on-chain data. It's coming from Ribbit's own creative output months after everything else. And so, after all this, there's really two questions. Is Tibbir a stealth launch by Ribbit Capital? Only you can decide that. And if it is, what is it? Is it core infrastructure? Is it just a meme? We can only take past experiences and see what Ribbit Capital are truly like, what they're trying to build, what they have been building in fintech for the last 15 years to get an idea of what it could be if it is tied to them because, you know, it might not be tied to them. Finally, guys, just a massive shout-out to the channel's sponsor, Uphold. Uphold is a wicked exchange with deep liquidity. They actually made the Forbes best list in 2024. And the main reason I like them is because you can get this card, and if you're in crypto, you'll know how painful it can be turning assets on-chain into money in your bank. Being able to spend it directly has been incredibly convenient for me. This is not intended for a UK audience. Crypto is a high-risk investment. You could lose all your money, and you shouldn't expect protection if something goes wrong. Thank you very much to Uphold for sponsoring this portion of the video. But guys, thank you so much for watching. 2025 has been an incredible year and it's thanks to you guys sitting here listening to me blabber on that I've been able to do this. So honestly from the bottom of my heart, thank you very, very much. I really, really wish you the best festive period if you celebrate. Otherwise, hopefully you have some time off. Thank you ever so much. I shall see you in the next one. I think right now it's trading like a meme instead of a foundational tech because honestly you can't access much of the tech."
