      "text": "Here's something that shouldn't really happen. A \npublic AI agent appears online and starts talking   about ideas that later show up in a confidential \ninvestor letter. And instead of being shut down,   it's quietly tolerated. In this video, we're \ngoing to walk through documents, on-chain data,   and observable behavior, separating what we \ncan verify from what we can't. And by the end,   you can decide whether this is just a \ncoincidence or did the best fintech firm   of the last 15 years stealth launch a little \nfrog meme. This video is for information   and entertainment only. It reflects my \npersonal opinions and is not financial   advice. Check the description for more \ninformation. Always do your own research. To fully understand why this is even worth \nlooking at, we first have to understand who   this VC firm is. Ribbit Capital. Ribbit is not \na crypto fund. They're one of the most important   fintech venture firms in the last 15 years. They were early in Stripe, Coinbase, Nubank,   Revolut. The list is stacked. Just check it \nout. Their focus has always been financial   infrastructure. Stuff like payments, identity, \ncompliance, rails, trust. And importantly,   Ribbit has a long history of building very \nquietly. They don't announce ideas early. They don't hype experiments. They let \nthings exist before they explain them. Ribbit's co-founder Micky Malka has been \nconsistent about one thing for decades. He tends to focus less on products and more \non systems. He bought Bitcoin early but not   as a trade. He bought it because he was \ninterested in what programmable money   could become. He backed Robinhood before it \nworked and saved them when they almost died,   and he focused on access to finance long \nbefore it became fashionable to do so. It helps to understand the kind of long-term \nthinking this firm, and especially Micky,   are known for. Micky has been consistent on \none idea for years: Money on its own is not   enough. But for the next decade, money without \nknowledge is not money. It's not valuable anymore. What do you mean by that? If money \nhas no knowledge of what it's doing,   it has no smart contract. It has no rules. It has no decision tree that was made to   move it from one place to another. It doesn't \nhold that information. It's not valuable. What matters is money plus decision-making. And \nthat framing shows up again and again in Ribbit's   investments. And if you follow the logic all the \nway through, the natural endpoint isn't apps,   it's agents. And that's the direction of travel \nMicky has been openly talking about for years. One of the first questions people always \nask when they see this story: If it's real,   why wouldn't Ribbit just say it? And the \nanswer is simple. Stealth is normal for   Ribbit. They've repeatedly backed companies \nthat stayed private early, avoided hype,   and only surfaced once the infrastructure was \nready. It isn't secrecy for fun. It's protection. Protection from being copied, premature \nregulation, and the story outrunning the product. Underpinning everything that follows is a \ndocument that Ribbit circulated in 2024,   and it's known as the Identity Letter. The \nletter isn't the story in and of itself. It's   the foundation for understanding \nRibbit's worldview. Without it,   nothing else in this investigation makes \nsense. At the time, it was confidential,   shared privately with partners and LPs. And three \nideas run through the entire document. First,   identity comes before access. Today, you log \nin with your usernames and your passwords. Ribbit's view is that this breaks down at scale. Instead, systems ask, \"Who are you? What can you   prove? And what are you authorized to do?\" Access \nbecomes automatic based on credentials, not login. Second, software begins to act on your behalf. Right now, you manually click buttons. Ribbit's   view is that this changes. You set rules once and \nsoftware executes decisions for you. Paying bills,   booking flights, moving money, running checks. You're not involved every time. The system acts   with permissions you've already approved. Third, \ninfrastructure matters more than interfaces. Most people focus on apps, what things look \nlike. Ribbit focuses on what sits underneath:   permissions, enforcements, settlement. Those \ninvisible systems matter more than the screen   you tap. And that's where Ribbit invests. This \nletter is Ribbit explaining how the world has to   work before any products can exist. And crucially, \nit exists before anything else in the story. There is one more factual detail that \nsits alongside the Identity Letter. In US SEC filings, an entity named Tibbir \nTrust appears as a reporting holder. Now,   these filings are not commentary or \nmarketing material. They're formal   disclosures required under US securities \nlaws. In those disclosures, Tibbir Trust   is listed as holding equity in Robinhood \nalongside other Ribbit-related entities."

Now, these filings are not commentary or marketing material. They're formal disclosures required under US securities laws. In those disclosures, Tibbir Trust is listed as holding equity in Robinhood alongside other Ribbit-related entities. So,   these filings specify (a) the existence of the \ntrust, (b) its status as a reporting entity,   and (c) its ownership of publicly listed shares. It's the fact that Tibbir is the name of a real   pre-existing legal entity used in regulated \ndisclosures connected to Ribbit's ecosystem. After the Identity Letter had been circulating, \nan AI agent appears publicly launched on a   platform called Virtuals. Virtuals is a \nplatform where agents are deployed as an   entire system. So an agent is launched \nwith a token and it's launched with a   Twitter account that the agent controls. In this case, the agent is called Tibbir,   and it posts publicly on Twitter under the Twitter \nhandle Ribbit A20. From the outside, the agent is   not presented as being part of Ribbit. There's \nno branding, no claim of affiliation. There's   no hype. There's no token promotion. And at \nthis stage, there's nothing really to suggest   that Ribbit is behind this. All we can say \nfactually is that the agent appears after the   Identity Letter. It posts publicly to Twitter and \nits language closely mirrors the kind of systems   thinking Ribbit had already laid out internally. That alignment on its own doesn't prove anything. Maybe it got hold of the confidential Identity \nLetter and started circulating the information. But looking deeper, there seems to be an on-chain \nfootprint that connects Micky and the agent. Everything we've looked at could be coincidence. But the beauty of blockchain is that everything is   verifiable. When you look at the wallet associated \nwith a Tibbir agent deployment, one thing clearly   stands out. This wallet was directly funded by \nMicky Malka. Now, that fact alone doesn't prove   who controls Micky Malka. ENS names are not \nlegal entities, and we should be careful with   assumptions. So, instead of guessing, we can just \nfollow where that wallet actually goes. The ENS   name for Micky Malka is part of the same on-chain \ncluster as Canvas. And Canvas controls a vault   called Canvas Vault. And vault ENSs are typically \nused to hold high-value assets, right? And if we   look inside this vault, we can see the CryptoPunk \nthat Micky Malka uses as his PFP is inside this   vault. The vault's also got an additional 25 \nother CryptoPunks. Just as an aside, Micky Malka   actually owns the CryptoPunk IP via a nonprofit \norganization called Node. They acquired them off   Yuga Labs. Just know that Micky Malka really likes \nPunks. He really likes art. He really likes Punks. Just quickly guys, I want to tell you about \nEasy Bitcoin. This segment is sponsored by Easy   Bitcoin. They're part of the EasyGroup family \nand Easy Bitcoin operates a recurring purchase   service for Bitcoin. The service functions through \nscheduled card payments at user-defined intervals. Upon processing payment, the company purchases \nBitcoin and transfers it to a user-specified   address. The service operates in a non-custodial \nbasis, meaning purchased Bitcoin is sent directly   to the user's controlled wallet without being held \non the platform. This means users can choose how   much they want to DCA, how frequently they want \nto DCA, and it's never held by Easy Bitcoin. It's   always held in the user's own wallet. Easy Bitcoin \nis not available in the UK. And this information   is provided for educational purposes only and does \nnot constitute financial advice or a promotion. Cryptocurrency investments carry significant \nrisks, including total loss of capital. Always   do your own research. Thank you so much to Easy \nBitcoin for sponsoring this portion of the video. In 2025, Ribbit circulated another \ndocument. This one called the Token   Letter. Like the Identity Letter, this document \nwas confidential at the time, shared privately   with LPs before any public release. Unlike \nthe Identity Letter, this one wasn't abstract. It describes specific mechanics: how agents \nare instantiated, how tokens attach to agents,   how identity, memory, and expertise are \nrepresented, and how trust and permissions   are enforced programmatically."

It describes specific mechanics: how agents are instantiated, how tokens attach to agents, how identity, memory, and expertise are represented, and how trust and permissions are enforced programmatically. Before the \nToken Letter was distributed to the LPs,   the Tibbir agent was already posting ideas \nthat closely tracked the same mechanisms. It   even told us Coinbase would be listing tokenized \nstocks back in February. I mean, how did it know   that? It spoke about the one key theme in Ribbit's \nToken Letter well before it was public knowledge:   Token Factories. A key theme that underpins \nall Ribbit's plans with tokenization. After the timing anomaly, the agent moves from \nlanguage to action. The Tibbir agent used its   funds that it made from people trading the \ntoken. It had about a million dollars sitting   in one account, the LP account. It used a portion \nof those funds to buy a CryptoPunk. CryptoPunks   are one of the earliest and most recognizable \nforms of on-chain identity. Obviously, it's well   known Micky Malka values Punks. He literally \nowns the IP. And after the Punk purchase,   the agent issued a soulbound NFT to all Tibbir \nholders. This NFT can't be transferred. It's   not tradable. And it existed to commemorate \nthe agent's identity selection. The mint used   infrastructure provided by Crossmint, a Ribbit \nCapital portfolio company. And this matters,   right? Because if the agent had been fake, \nmisleading, or problematic, you would reasonably   expect some distance. Instead, the infrastructure \nwas used and the mint proceeded. The mint also   drew a bunch of public reaction. Ever Alonzo \nfrom Ribbit Capital reacted to it publicly. Now, this agent is actually followed by basically \neverybody inside Ribbit Capital. A few months ago,   Ribbit wiped their public presence clean. They \noverhauled their entire website and deleted every   single old tweet. And the new site introduced two \nsymbols that immediately stood out. The first was   a silver coin. If we inspect the webpage, we can \nsee that this is called Ribbitcoin. And visually,   it looks almost identical to the NFT that \nhad already been issued to Tibbir holders   by the agent. It's the same form, same color, \nsame structure. It just looks like the other   face of the coin. Now, it's not identical. It can easily be a mistake. It almost looks   like two sides of the same object. The NFT \ncame first. The website imagery came later. The second change was a little more subtle. Ribbit introduced a backwards \"R\" into its   visual language. No claim being made again, but \npeople notice that Tibbir is simply Ribbit spelled   backwards. And the reversed \"R\" suddenly feels \nlike, oh, you can literally read \"Tibbir\" inside   their website in the top right-hand corner. So, just this week, Ribbit released a brand   new four-part promo video. And in this video, it \nlooks like there's a bunch of Easter eggs that   have been left. Again, I'm going to show you what \nthey are. Make up your own mind as to whether or   not they are actual Easter eggs or just random \ncoincidences. The story follows a girl traveling   on a train from destination to destination. Now, \nquite clearly, this train is representing rails,   but you've got a girl carrying credentials, moving \non this train from destination to destination with   credentials. Each destination is a Ribbit Capital \nportfolio company and the rails are linking all   of these companies together. In the middle of this \ninfrastructure, the rails that connect it all is a   frog. Who knows what that means? But you've got \na girl carrying credentials, probably mimicking   the fact that agents are going to be traveling \nacross these rails with the credentials of the   client that they are acting on behalf of. It's just a clear example of Ribbit saying,   \"We are building infrastructure that underpins our \nmajor portfolio companies and we see the future   of finance.\" This isn't saying Tibbir is that \ninfrastructure. It's saying Ribbit is building it. Now in this video as well, as I said, there are \na few Easter eggs."

It's just a clear example of Ribbit saying, \"We are building infrastructure that underpins our major portfolio companies and we see the future of finance.\" This isn't saying Tibbir is that infrastructure. It's saying Ribbit is building it. Now in this video as well, as I said, there are a few Easter eggs. The original frog that was   used as the agent's PFP, and is still actually \nin the banner, is right here. The coin that's on   their website is on the front of this tray. Now, \nthis is the coin on their website. Unfortunately,   this isn't actually the NFT coin. And obviously, \nthere's this frog that sits in the middle of the   infrastructure rails. Again, none of this proves \nor confirms intent. It doesn't prove ownership. But these signals aren't coming from an agent. They're not coming from potentially ambiguous   on-chain data. It's coming from Ribbit's \nown creative output months after everything   else. And so, after all this, there's really two \nquestions. Is Tibbir a stealth launch by Ribbit   Capital? Only you can decide that. And if it is, \nwhat is it? Is it core infrastructure? Is it just   a meme? We can only take past experiences \nand see what Ribbit Capital are truly like,   what they're trying to build, what they have been \nbuilding in fintech for the last 15 years to get   an idea of what it could be if it is tied to them \nbecause, you know, it might not be tied to them. Finally, guys, just a massive shout-out \nto the channel's sponsor, Uphold. Uphold   is a wicked exchange with deep liquidity. They \nactually made the Forbes best list in 2024. And   the main reason I like them is because you \ncan get this card, and if you're in crypto,   you'll know how painful it can be turning assets \non-chain into money in your bank. Being able to   spend it directly has been incredibly \nconvenient for me. This is not intended   for a UK audience. Crypto is a high-risk \ninvestment. You could lose all your money,   and you shouldn't expect protection if something \ngoes wrong. Thank you very much to Uphold for   sponsoring this portion of the video. But \nguys, thank you so much for watching. 2025   has been an incredible year and it's thanks to \nyou guys sitting here listening to me blabber   on that I've been able to do this. So honestly \nfrom the bottom of my heart, thank you very,   very much. I really, really wish you the best \nfestive period if you celebrate. Otherwise,   hopefully you have some time off. Thank you \never so much. I shall see you in the next one. I think right now it's trading like \na meme instead of a foundational tech   because honestly you can't \naccess much of the tech."
