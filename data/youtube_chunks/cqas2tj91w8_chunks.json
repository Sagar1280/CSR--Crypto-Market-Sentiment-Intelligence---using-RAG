      "text": "Okay, our pump slightly stalled. And the reason \nwhy our pump slightly stalled—because we're still   at 96,755—the pump slightly stalled because the \ndiscussions around the Clarity Act stalled. I   think we need to talk about the Clarity Act and \nwhat the stall actually means because it is the   single most important piece of legislation for \ncrypto globally, not only in the US. I know it's   a US piece of legislation, but it is the single \nmost important piece of legislation for crypto   globally. Yesterday, the discussions in the Senate \naround the Clarity Act stalled. So, we need to   discuss exactly what happened, why it happened, \nwhat it means, which tokens it's going to effect,   and whether your bags are actually safe. That's \nwhat I'm going to break down for you today. I'm also going to show you why I think the pump \nis going to continue. Another big show today,   I've really got a lot of stuff going \non. It's a big, big, big show. Let's go. All right, let's get going. Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine, guys. I see you all in the   chat. Everybody's here again. Glenn Goldberg is \nhere as usual. Wife Changing Money is here as   usual. Davis Jansen's here. Everybody's here. We're going to talk about a lot of things,   including the pump. You know my feeling around \nthis pump is very simple, right? You mustn't cry   because it's over; you must smile because it \nhappened, guys. Don't cry because the pump's   over. Smile because the pump happened. That's \nDr. Seuss, in case you don't know that. We're   going to talk about the pump and exactly why \nit stalled. It stalled because the discussions   in the Senate Banking Committee regarding the \nClarity Act stalled. They were stalled primarily   by Coinbase. I'm going to show you why. It seems \nlike it's a Coinbase thing and not an industry   thing. I'm going to show you exactly why I think \nit's happening. Who's being protected? Who's not   being protected? Hint, hint: the big banks are \nthere. Hint, hint: Elizabeth Warren's there. Big show. Listen guys, I see everybody here. I \nsee a lot of people are starting to come back. Thank you to all of you for helping us by \nhitting the like button because you guys are   bringing back all our old friends and they're \nall coming to hang with us again. Please help,   just smash the like button. If you're \nnot subscribed, subscribe to the channel. Though most people are already subscribed. You \nguys are already part of the fam. As I said,   I think we need to talk about this pump. As I said in the beginning of the show,   don't cry because it's over; smile because it \nhappened. Right now, if I look at this pump,   we are above that key area. We're at 96,000 \nand 97,000. Remember, we had such a bad year   last year. It was an embarrassing year for crypto \nbecause we ended in the midst of a correction. But   because we started off on such a low level—we \nstarted the year off in the 90,000s—so far,   we are actually the number four best-performing \nmajor asset this year. It's a small victory   because we came from a very low base, but there \nis a lesson there. The lesson is that if you   come from a low base, you're due a catch-up \ntrade. It makes for a very, very good year. That's one of my theses around what's going \nto happen this year. I think Bitcoin is going   to be touted as one of the best-performing \nassets this year. Not only because it's a very   good performing asset, but more importantly \nbecause it came off a low base and because   fund managers artificially measure returns from \none period to another. That's what I made a video   on Crypto Insider about. I spoke about this and \nsaid we're going to have a big catch-up trade,   maybe not because of the performance of the \nasset, but because we're going to start off a   low base. When you start off a low base, people \nstart to look at you and say, \"Well, what's the   best-performing asset this year?\" They're going \nto see things like the fact that right now Bitcoin   is the best-performing asset. Then they're \ngoing to say, \"Wow, can you afford to not be   invested in the fourth best-performing asset? I mean, you're invested in silver, platinum,   palladium. How can you afford not to be invested \nin Bitcoin?\" That's exactly what's happening. In fact, if you look at what Eric Balchunas \nsaid—I really love this tweet—he said,   \"Bitcoin ETFs had their biggest day yesterday, \n$843 million of inflow. The one week now is at   a billion and the year to date is at 1.5 billion."

The one week now is at a billion and the year to date is at 1.5 billion. Bitcoin sitting at a price of 97,000 after being   at like 88 for what seemed to be like half a year. It feels like maybe the buyers have exhausted the   sellers. We'll see though. I do know that if we \nhit 100K, some people are going to gnash their   teeth so bad that they should probably go ahead \nand buy a free mouth guard. Peace and love.\" It's   a tweet which sounds kind of weird, but that's \nhow investment psychology works. If something is   moving up from a calendar date, then people say, \n\"Wow, we should be invested in it.\" Right now,   Bitcoin is the fourth best-performing asset. The \nbest-performing major asset this year is silver. The good news is that we opened up a silver \nbot on Pionex. For those who don't know,   Pionex is a place where you can trade with \nbots. This wallet has been going with $50,000   since before October 10th and it's at \n$133,000, which just shows you how well   the bots can trade without the humans. You \ncan also open bots on silver, copper, gold,   and all the commodities. I'm not going to spend \ntoo much time on the bot on this show, but if   you want to join a free Discord group, it's free. It's where we post all the bots because we just   wanted to separate the bot traders from the main \nshow. There's a link in the description below. Just go to the description below and you'll \nsee a link to the free Discord where you can   basically just sign up. It's over here. Just \nsign up to the free Discord and you guys can   get all of it, including the silver bot, \nthe gold bot, the Apple bot, stocks, etc. So, the pump basically continues. We've \nbroken a whole lot of crucial levels;   a lot of crucial levels left to go. I think the \nmost important thing here is the following: Number   one, the ETF buyers are back. You can see over a \nbillion this week. Number two, the yield is coming   back. The yield is very important because the \nyield on an annualized basis shows us the demand   for Bitcoin perpetuals, which is an important \nmeasure. It shows you the risk appetite in the   market. The main thing that I'm seeing here is \nthat the takers are the dominant buyers. There's   a taker seller and a taker buyer here. Right now, \nthe buyers are ruling the market. We are being   set up for another short squeeze. You have an \ninteresting funding setup. The price is going up,   but the funding is going deeply negative. This \nmeans that as we go up here, people are going   short. That could cause a short squeeze. I \nsuspect that as we get to $100,000, we're   going to see the mother of all short squeezes. That's going to take us all the way up above. But anyway, for now, our pump is slightly \nstalled. Not a lot. It's 96,400. Much honor. Oh,   who blessed that? As I mentioned to you, the \nreason why the pump stalled is because of   the Clarity Act and the fact that the discussions \nin the Senate Banking Committee failed. Now,   for those who are not American or for those of \nyou trying to understand why this Clarity Act   is so important, let me give you the rundown. It \nis the single most important piece of legislation   of all time. Why? Because a lot of countries \nare waiting to see how America regulates crypto   before they regulate crypto. Also, America is \none of the big countries where crypto has to   be accepted because the US dollar is the reserve \ncurrency in the world and the US is probably the   biggest country in the world. In order for this \npiece of legislation, which is the second piece   of legislation to go through... The first piece \nof legislation was the Genius Act."

In order for this piece of legislation, which is the second piece of legislation to go through... The first piece of legislation was the Genius Act. Someone said,   \"Much honor.\" You guys remember much honor? These \nare for the real old people that have been here. So, the Clarity Act is the second piece of \nlegislation. The Genius Act really spoke about   stablecoins. The Clarity Act is literally designed \nto give people clarity about crypto. It's to give   people clarity about DeFi, clarity about what \nyou can and can't build as a developer. It's   around investor protections. It's pretty much the \none act that is going to make crypto mainstream. The reason why that's so important is because \nthere are a lot of corporations and a lot of   real money, sovereign money, and state money that \ncan't invest in crypto or can't invest in certain   sectors of crypto until there is certainty about \nwhat crypto actually is. And when I say crypto,   I'm talking about crypto, not Bitcoin. Because \nfor all intents and purposes, people know how   to deal with Bitcoin. So, the Clarity Act is \nactually much, much more. It is for Bitcoin   because Bitcoin is obviously the bedrock of the \nindustry, but it's much more for altcoins. The   problem with altcoins is that we don't really \nknow what's legal in the US and what's not. We   don't know how to deal with DeFi. We don't \nknow what we can pass interest rates on. We   don't know what we can develop. That's not really \na Bitcoin thing; it's much more an altcoin thing. It is the single most important \npiece of legislation. The process   for it to get passed as law: it has to go \nthrough the Senate Agriculture Committee,   the Senate Banking Committee, and then it has to \ngo for the final vote in the House. Now where are   we? The Senate Banking Committee decided to pull \ntomorrow's scheduled market structure following   drama with Coinbase. It seems that Coinbase \nhas a problem with this bill. Brian Armstrong   tweeted, \"After reviewing the Senate Banking \nCommittee draft text over the last 48 hours,   Coinbase unfortunately can't support the \nbill as written. There are too many issues,   including a de facto ban on tokenized equities, \nDeFi prohibitions, giving government unlimited   access to your financial records, and \nremoving your right to privacy.\" Read   that word \"privacy\" because we're going to talk \nabout it later. \"Erosion of the CFTC's authority,   stifling innovation and making it subservient \nto the SEC. Draft amendments would kill rewards   on stablecoins, allowing banks to \nban their competition.\" He says,   \"We appreciate all the hard work by the members to \nreach a bipartisan outcome, but we'd rather have   no bill than a bad bill. Hopefully, we can get \na better draft and we'll keep fighting for it.\" Important for you to notice that the one party \nthat's very much against this is Coinbase. There   are many other parties that are actually very \nmuch for this, including Andreessen Horowitz,   Kraken, Ripple, Paradigm, and Circle. Not only \nthat, other people that are for it: XRP, Ripple,   Chris Dixon from Andreessen, Arjun from Kraken, \nbut also Vlad from Robinhood. They're all looking   specifically at what they want. So Vlad's looking \nat staking, saying, \"Look, staking is one of the   most requested features on the Robinhood app, \nbut it's still unavailable to customers in the   US due to the current gridlock. Stock tokens \nare available for our customers in the EU,   but not in our home market. It's time for \nthe US to lead on crypto.\" He's saying,   \"Let's pass legislation, protect consumers, \nand let's get the show on the road.\" Chris Dixon is basically saying, \"Crypto builders \nneed clear rules for the road. Over the past 5   years, Republicans, Democrats, and the Trump \nadministration have worked closely with members   across the board to protect the industry. At \nits core, this bill does that. It's not perfect,   and changes are needed before it becomes \nlaw. But now is the time to move with the   Clarity Act.\""

It's not perfect, and changes are needed before it becomes law. But now is the time to move with the Clarity Act.\" They all want the Clarity \nAct to move. Everyone wants it to move,   but Brian Armstrong is the biggest opponent saying \nwe cannot sign this act into law. Remember that   everyone here is protecting their interest. I don't think this is a perfect bill by any   stretch of the imagination. From what I've read, \nit's not good for tokenization. It doesn't protect   developers against developing things, which \nis quite a problem. But the main problem here,   and the reason why Coinbase is pushing back, \nis about this issue on stablecoins. If it   wasn't for this issue on stablecoins, \nthings would be completely different. Now, why is Coinbase fighting so hard on this \nstablecoin thing? And if you want to read between   the lines, why is Circle actually agreeing with \nthis bill? Circle is actually in support. What's   going on here? Well, what I think a lot of you \ndon't know is that Coinbase makes a lot of money   from a distribution agreement with Circle. They \nare a distribution platform for USDC. That's where   most trading pairs are done, USDC trading pairs. Coinbase is a massive distributor for Circle and   Coinbase makes money from Circle through this \nthing called a USDC economics agreement. In 2024,   Circle paid Coinbase almost a billion \ndollars tied to USDC distribution economics. Analysts also noted that Coinbase earned \nroughly 300 million in just Q1 of 2025 from   these distribution payments. How the split \nworks: Coinbase receives 100% of the reserve   interest income from the USDC held on Coinbase \nand a 50/50 split of the reserve income off the   platform. In other words, if there are USDC coins \nsitting on Coinbase, which are your USDC coins,   Coinbase is earning 100% of the interest income, \nwhich is at government yields of 4% and 5%. In the new proposed bill, the problem is that \none of the things around stablecoins is that   you may not share the revenue on stablecoin \ninterest. That is the biggest thing that I   think Brian Armstrong is fighting against. The real fight here isn't between Circle   and Facebook. The real fight here is the banks. The banks want to make sure that the stablecoin   business doesn't replace them. Listen to what \nBrian Armstrong said here: \"Well, in that case,   I think that's just the banks trying to \nprotect their profit margin. They should   have to pay rewards and higher rates to their \nown customers. I think they're trying to put   their thumb on the scale of regulatory capture \nessentially to prevent crypto from doing that. But my prediction is actually the banks are going \nto start... we're already seeing this actually,   they're going to be increasingly embracing \nstablecoins. My guess is that in a year or   two they'll come back and say actually we want to \nbe able to pay interest and yield on stablecoins   in our own companies. It goes back to that \ninnovator's dilemma situation. The best banks are   leaning into this as an opportunity and the ones \nwho are fighting it are going to get left behind.\" The whole argument is about the fact that \nCoinbase pays 400% more interest than a typical   bank on a bank account. Let's look at what that \nactually means. When the bank takes your money,   the bank invests that money into treasury \nyields and they earn about 4%. So, you put   $100 into the bank deposit. The bank invests that \nmoney in treasury yields or lends that money out   and they pay you 0.39%, which is less than 10% \nof the profit that they earn. With stablecoins,   you don't need a bank. You can put your money into \nUSDC and earn 4% just by holding the stablecoin. The bank doesn't like this because effectively \nwhat it's doing is cutting out the entire   banking system model. That is what the \nbanks are trying to protect against here."

That is what the banks are trying to protect against here. Here is a letter urging the senators to close \nthe stablecoin loop, written by the Bankers   Association of America. It says, \"The Genius \ntax, while not perfect from a community bank   perspective, was a reasonable attempt to bring \nstablecoin into market regulation. Among the   most important provisions is a ban on interest \npayments that was put in place to ensure that this   new payments market can develop maturely without \nbecoming a competitor to bank deposits. Under   the law, stablecoin issuers cannot pay interest \nbecause allowing inducements like interest, yield,   or reward could incentivize customers to park \ntheir savings not in a bank, but in a stablecoin. Congress recognized that this could significantly \ndisrupt community lending because banks could   use those deposits to provide individuals and \nbusinesses with loans that they need to expand.\" The banks are basically saying, \"Look, if \nyou allow this, then people won't put their   money into the bank and therefore we won't have \nbanks to help the businesses of America.\" Well,   innovate your business model! Because here you \ncan put your money into a stablecoin and get 4-9%. The banks want to say, \"No, we want to take your \nmoney, deposit it at 4%, and fund our expenses.\" This big stall is about the interest rates. Rest \nassured, everything else can be negotiated. Circle   doesn't mind. I believe Circle has an agreement \nwith Coinbase, but if the legislation says Circle   can't pay Coinbase a distribution fee, Circle \nwill go, \"Damn, Coinbase, we can't pay you. But that means we just make another billion \ndollars because we're not allowed to pay you.\" The real fight here is actually against the \ntraditional banking system. We should be   fighting the traditional banking system here. It's no surprise that the person most lobbied   by the banks is Elizabeth Warren. She's filed \n38 amendments to the bill, including removing   developer protections, more sanctions, compliance \nobligations, more illicit activity checks, etc. She's fighting this bill because we know she's \nalways the one fighting for the traditional banks. Where are we at now? The discussions have stalled, \nbut it's not unusual for discussions to stall   while people take a breath, regroup, renegotiate, \nand come back with slightly different drafts. Polymarket is still predicting a 60% chance that \nthis bill is going to be passed by the end of   the year. Which is good. It's the highest it's \nbeen in a long time. It dropped as low as 41%,   and now it's on the way back up. Most opinions \nI've seen are saying they're all negotiating in   good faith and think it will happen. Mike \nNovogratz said, \"While the bill might be   delayed to keep working, I'm confident we'll \nget the bill passed. I've spoken to over 10   senators on both sides of the aisle and I believe \nthey're all working together in good faith.\" Senator Cynthia Lummis didn't want to comment \non Coinbase's opposition, but when asked if it   would impact the process, she said, \"I think \nit'll have a profound impact on the process.\" I asked ChatGPT, \"Why is Coinbase so important \nto this process?\" ChatGPT said Coinbase is the   proof that crypto can be regulated. They're the \nmost regulated player in crypto. If they say   the legislation doesn't work, then the legislation \ndoesn't actually work. Also, they are probably the   biggest political donor to this movement. We need \nthem to pass. It's very important we get this act   passed very soon. Number one, we may be going into \nanother government shutdown. Number two, we need   to get this piece of legislation passed before the \nmidterm elections. Right now, the Republicans are   in the House and they own the Senate. There is \na 78% probability that the Democrats will win   the House in 2026. If the Democrats win the House \nin the midterms, this legislation ain't passing. Who is the person most incentivized in the \nentire world to get this passed?"

If the Democrats win the House in the midterms, this legislation ain't passing. Who is the person most incentivized in the entire world to get this passed? David Sacks,   the Crypto Czar. His reputation is on the \nline. He's saying, \"The passage of the   market structure legislation remains as close as \never. The crypto industry should use this pause   to resolve any remaining differences. Now is the \ntime to set the rules of the road and secure the   future of this industry.\" I believe this thing \nshould get passed. 61% chance it'll come into   law in 2026. If we want a free and smooth ride in \ncrypto, we need the US to regulate substantially. That is why the pump stalled. Now the \nquestion becomes, which tokens will be   affected by the legislation actually going in \nor not? If it doesn't happen, certain tokens   benefit. One token that would really benefit \nfrom the Clarity Act not passing is Monero,   because the Clarity Act basically hates \nMonero. The Clarity Act is not going to allow   illicit privacy like Monero. That's why when \nthe talks failed, Monero started to absolutely   explode. Hitesh, can you do me a favor? Can you \nput the video live for me? I've made a video   which I'm going to post on the other channel, \nCrypto Insider, straight after the show. I've   actually compared Zcash to Monero because if \nthe Clarity Act passes, it's really good for   Zcash. If it doesn't pass, it's really good for \nMonero. I made the \"Ultimate Showdown\" video. Other tokens which suffer are any tokens that \nhave 20% controlled by one wallet or by one   group of people. They deem those tokens to be \nsecurities. So, Arbitrum, Uniswap, Optimism, Lido,   BNB—they are all deemed to be securities. Why? Because they all have that 20% impact   rule. You got to keep watching this because \nif the Clarity Act passes, it's not good for   these tokens. Monero: not good if the Clarity Act \npasses, which is why as soon as it wasn't passed,   Monero took a big jump. Otherwise, let's look \nat how the other altcoins actually responded. You can see quite a red day in general. The one \naltcoin that really went up yesterday was ICP,   Internet Computer. Remember why we like Internet \nComputer? It has this AI tool called Caffeine   which allows you to create a decentralized app \nusing AI. Anyone can vibe code a decentralized   app within 20 seconds. Yesterday they published \na new white paper which deals with emissions. It reduces ICP inflation by 70% by the end \nof 2026. That is why the ICP price pumped. You know I'm not such a genius; there's no way \nI was going to read this long white paper. I   can't even read a bedtime story, that's how bad \nmy ADD is. So I gave it to ChatGPT and said,   \"Just summarize it for me.\" Now I sound \nreally smart. That's the thing with AI. I read and read with 10 researchers every day, \nprocess information, and make portfolio moves. That's what you call alpha. But AI can do \nthat much better because I'm emotional. I   take trades too early. I took the Lido trade \nslightly too early. I should have gone long   today instead of yesterday. AI doesn't have \nemotions. One day I'm going to get replaced by AI. The problem is that AI is not likable. It's \ntoo perfect, like plastic. So we at Banter   wanted to change that. For the last couple of \nmonths, we've been working on creating an AI   host that is actually likable. He has a history, \na dog, a girlfriend, a story. His name is Jax. I want you guys to meet Jax and see his new \nvideo. This video is absolutely spotted. Jax said:   \"You know that just seven stocks are responsible \nfor 42% of the S&P gains. They're called the   Magnificent 7 and include giants like Google, \nNvidia, and Tesla. These are the most important   stocks in the world."

I \ndid mention to you we'd be taking some trades. The Lido trade we got into a bit early and \nthe pump stalled. I'm not worried about it;   I'm still holding it. ENA and Zcash, very \nconfident in my positions. Our trading   portfolio is a $50,000 portfolio. It's \nabout $600 down. Still holding exactly   the same trade. No changes as yet. I will \nupdate you guys if we ever have changes. I   think that's it for today. See you guys again \ntomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends."
