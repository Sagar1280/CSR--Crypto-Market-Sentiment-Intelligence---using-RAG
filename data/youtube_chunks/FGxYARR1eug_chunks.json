      "text": "And you still got people like Brad saying, \"Well, it's not perfect, but we just got to get something. You know, it's better than no clarity.\" [laughter] Hand it to the same people who sued us. Hand it to the same people who put us out of business, who subpoenaed us, who put us in jail. That's better. >> Cardano's Charles Hoskinson [music] blasts Ripple CEO over sabotaged Clarity Act. >> That's what we fought for. That's what we voted for. And tell me, how do we change it? Like we changed the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 93 years later, have we been able to change it? No. >> Now, the CEO of Ripple is on record that a bad bill is better than no bill. >> Clarity is always better than chaos, [music] and the industry needs clarity. Perfection I think in my experience [music] like is the market structure bill that's pending in the banking committee is it perfect? No. Certainly not. But is it better than nothing? Absolutely. You pass it. You own it forever. Sorry Brad. It's not better than chaos. Take the chaos and fight for what's right. Fight for integrity. I didn't sign up to hand the revolution to 15 banks. [music] to live in a world where everything is a custodial wallet. Every transaction is KYC. Everything is a is mutable and reversible can be frozen at a whim when that number comes stamped on my forehead. I signed up for freedom. >> And here's where we stand with the Clarity Act today, which as we know is the biggest piece of crypto legislation in history. It will define clear rules for crypto to thrive in America for the first time ever. The Clarity Act passing would be like a starter gun for ETH and Soul to run into trillions of dollars of value >> is now in complete disarray as the stable coin yield fight threatens to sink the Clarity Act as Coinbase and the White House clash, as you know, Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has pulled his support for the current draft. >> I think the really pivotal moment was when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, as you know, pulled his support very publicly from the bill. and that sort of it still took a little bit more time for the committee to make it official, but they have said they're going to postpone it. They have not said when they might try to reschedule this markup. Um, we've seen tweets from Senator Lumis, one of the principal negotiators on the bill and others this morning, uh, also Senate Senator Hagerty and some Democrats saying, you know, they remain at the table. They still want to find a solution that can sort of appease the crypto crowd, appease banks. Um, but the timing for that is TBD and also how they're going to get there is still very much in the air. These are big industries that are both very entrenched on what their asks are. Right now, the main fight is over the digital asset industry's ability to offer something like rewards or interest to users. Banks do not like that and they're looking to get some even more restrictive language in uh future bill text. And of course, as Brian Armstrong and many others have said, that's that's just a non-starter for them, and they would rather deal with the status quo and have what they're saying is better to have no bill than a bad bill. >> Brian Armstrong says that no bill is better than a bad bill. And the problems in the current draft of this bill are untenable. >> I'd rather have no bill than a bad bill. >> They say tokenized stocks are banned, meaning no blockchain stocks in the US. DeFi is regulated like banks, killing privacy and decentralization. The SEC takes more power, meaning more control, less innovation. And of course, banks retain a monopoly on yield, while stable coin yield for individuals like you, like me, are banned. Now, what comes next? What needs to happen now for this to pass? TBD. All the world juggernauts in finance, the banks, crypto tech are in Davos this weekend at the World Economic Forum. And in Brian Armstrong's latest update, they'll keep talking about it. >> Number two, we're going to continue to work on the market structure legislation and meet with some of the bank CEOs to figure out how we can make this a win-win. This stable coin should be an opportunity for both banks and crypto companies as long as we're all treated on a level playing field. and of course defer to the Senate and the administration about how to take those discussions forward."

As of today, the New York Stock Exchange is proud to announce the development of a platform for trading onchain settlement of tokenized securities. Literally, the New York Stock Exchange is tokenizing themselves. Here's what they're building. It's a complete new trading venue with 247 operation, meaning no market hours. You can just trade stocks 24/7. Instant settlement. It's not T+1. You don't have to wait a day. Stable coinbased funding, not bank wires, and tokens natively issues, issued as digital securities. This is not retrofitting the existing exchange. This is not adding blockchain to the back office. This is an entirely new venue. So, you have a choice. And what blockchain did they choose to launch this on? We don't know. The New York Stock Exchange has not announced this yet. Although, we do know the White House has selected key [snorts] blockchains that they're using. So, it's very likely that the New York Stock Exchange will use the blockchains that the White House is using as their proof of concept. when the US government started pushing economic data onto the blockchain. This was back in August of 2025 when Howard Lutnik announced this. >> Two more things. The Department of Commerce is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain because you are the crypto president and we are going to put out GDP on the blockchain so people can use the blockchain for data distribution and then we're going to make that available to the entire government so all of you can do it. We're just ironing out all the details so we can do it. And in a deliberate effort not to pick blockchain favorites, the department put out Thursday's data via Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tron, Stellar, Avalanche, and Ethereum L2s, Arbitum, Polygon, and Optimism. The agency also sent the data through Chainlink and Pith. So, as the New York Stock Exchange rolls out their tokenization platform, this should drive trillions and trillions of dollars through those blockchains as all those tokenized stocks are settled on chain. We also know that exchange partner Binance has dropped their 2025 report, meaning their year in review, and it's amazing to see crypto and everyday life accelerating. So, I'll link this full article down below for you to check out, but by the numbers, they now have over 300 million plus registered users. Their average daily trading volume across all products went up 18% in 2025. Their users on Binance Pay went up 30% in 2025. So, the growth is clear, yet at the same time, participation is becoming more diverse. So, Binance expanded their spot markets to 490 coins and 1,889 spot trading pairs and futures coverage to 584 coins. We see this in the numbers here. Growth by 54% and growth by 14 and 18%. As well as $1.2 billion in rewards distributed to Binance earn users. Very cool to see the chains or in this case the exchanges growing. And just in the country of Bermuda is building the world's first fully onchain national economy with help by Coinbase and Circle. So what this partnership means for crypto? Bermuda's government is partnering with Coinbase and Circle to pilot stable coin payments, expand USDC merchant use, and push tokenization across the economy. This is good for Ethereum. This is good for Ethereum L2 base as that's probably where they'll be pushing the infrastructure on where Bermuda will be tokenized. And as more announcements come out of Davos this week, very important, stay subscribed, tune into Altcoin Daily every day, and I will keep you updated."
