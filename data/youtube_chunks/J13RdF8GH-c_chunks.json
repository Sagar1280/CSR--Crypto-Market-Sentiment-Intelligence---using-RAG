      "text": "Fantam guys, a little bit of liftoff. Starting to see a couple of tokens really start to pop off nicely. Um, and this is just coming back to the thesis of us getting ready for a short squeeze, right? Ultimately markets been drained for months and months and months. Um, shorters have been getting highly arrogant and it's time for a pump and we've been preparing for the pump. Um, and now we are starting to get it. Now the exciting thing is on the weekly time frame we are only just starting to break trends, right? But the cool thing is that I'm seeing a lot of specifically today is a lot of different tokens pumping. Obviously, we've seen Dash start to wake up. Um, a couple of little hints when I get into the show now. I just went long on Filecoin. Filecoin is breaking a very big structure. ZK Sync is breaking a very key structure and a lot of these different tokens are breaking key trends now and we're starting to get some bigger moves in the market, right? We're starting to get a couple of the 60 80 100% moves yet again. So the aim of today is we had PPI coming up, CPI came out yesterday. Um not much happened. A little drop off and then market took off, right? Very much what we spoke. I expect I did expect a little bit more of a pullback, but markets took off. And ultimately, we got to understand that this market's been red, red, red, red, red. We can't complain if there's no more pullbacks, right? Make up your mind. Build your long-term bags, build your long-term trades, build your bots, and then get ready to trade the market, right? But it is time for this market to start returning some money to people's hands. Specifically those who have been building in these hard times. So I want to spend today very much around a lot of altcoins going through 20 30 40 50 altcoins looking at which ones are breaking out because right now all different alcoins are pumping and the key here is to follow the same recipe and catch them breaking the major trends. When they break the major trends tokens are taking off fast. Right now I even see that block stacks is getting ready to pop off. I see NEO protocol is looking strong as well, right? So there is a lot to speak about. So guys, let's have some fun together. I really, really, really want us to make money. That is the number one goal of today's show and to be honest the whole damn year. So let's go. >> I get [music] inside. Yes, squad. Brand to the family. Hit the subscribe button and like it up. Like, like, like. Markets are moving up. Let's get the likes going through the roof. And let's spend time going through everything. So, there's just so much the actual structure of the show is going to be all over the place because we're just going to look at whatever is breaking out, okay? Look at what opportunities are. Are they breaking on short time frame, high time frame, midtime frame? So the first one I just want to open up to you guys is I've just recently taken a Falcoin long, right? Falcoin long. My stop loss is around 1.56. So give you guys a little bit of idea of risk right now. It's around 2% risk, right? So it comes down to risk appetite of which one. But for me now that all altcoins are waking up, right? And it's crazy that the ones that have obviously been smashed over the last couple of weeks and months are going to start putting in some really big moves to the upside. Okay, but when it comes to me choosing, let's say Falcoin as an example, right? I'm looking for break speed up and I'm getting out, right? But I'm looking at a 10 20 30% move very quickly. So just want to quickly update you guys that I've taken bfunded longs on Falcoin, right? Again, my stop loss 1.56. So 2% risk. I will not be buying this above $1.6, right? So this I've entered on this account of Bitfunded and this account of Bitfunded over here too, right? All of them in Falcoin as we speak. However, I see that I still have a bunch of cash available. Okay. And I'm seeing a bunch of new tokens break out every couple of every half an hour hour. We're seeing new tokens just starting to break these trends. The key here, right, for me is anything to do with spots, long-term bots, blue chips, right?"

The key here, right, for me is anything to do with spots, long-term bots, blue chips, right? Anything to do with trading, move where the money is going. The market is starting to expand. The market is starting to look for a quick fast recovery push to the upside. Will it last? Who cares? I'm there to make the money and I'm there to get out and I'm trading where we are showing strength. So, the one that I am seeing strength is Falcoin. The moment we break this high, there is a very strong push up to 1.7, right? But look at this. Now, I'm one person that caught this pump last year, right? I ended up turning $5,000 into like something like $95,000 in a day, right? It was quite crazy, okay? But that was a fast rally. And you get whenever we get these sparks again, we get these rallies that come, they always come after big drops, big sidewards, they come, they don't last, then they go down again, right? Don't last and they come again. So again, I'm looking at a nice little pulse within a lot of these these tokens. Okay? And this is one that I'm paying attention to. So the trade that I'm looking at here is the first trade is obviously to 1.7. That's the key break. I do think we are going to break this because Bitcoin has started to break out of long-term trends. So has example couple of blue chips. Look at Salana. Look at the six-mon trend to the downside. Starting to break through. So this is not small time frame breakouts. These are high time frame breakouts which means we should start seeing some really fast acceleration incoming. We've seen a lot of downtime, lot of chopping. We should really start moving. So another hint here of what's another good trade right now is Salana, right? getting some soul. This can mean something a little bit more conservative, more spot, more bots or any of these type of things. Even leverage trading too, right? For me, I'm kind of moving to the shinier, smaller ones. I'm only trading 10 20% of my money and I'm making just as much money versus risking 50 or 100% of my capital in the sole position. I go for a little bit of the smaller tokens now. But nonetheless, where there's strength, you go to where the the risk makes sense, right? So again, these high time frame moves for me are quite important. And if I look at this over here on file, what ultimately I am looking to to to get here is a pop off to around $2, right? We'll see if it gets to 1.7, starts to slow down, I'll TPI, move to the next, especially with Bitfunded accounts. Take your money when it's on the damn table, right? Very, very, very important. But letting you guys know, this is one of the tokens. The other token that I'm paying attention to right now is ZK Sync, right? Another token for me that's looking for a nice little pop to mid-range of where we've dropped off. Something like ZK Sync. We look at where we were last week, right? And we look at where we pumped to 4.5, which is 25% of where we are now. Very likely we fill that this week, right? So that's the first area. But the next key areas I'm looking at is around this area of around the 5-cent mark. This could be a very nice 40 60% move. Paying attention to short time frame. Zooming in. And I've zoomed out now and and had an understanding of does this look good? Okay. And I look at the pop. I look at the bull flag. I look at the breakout we just had. Okay. And it gives me full structure. It tells me that ultimately the buy is in this area over here."

And it gives me full structure. It tells me that ultimately the buy is in this area over here. Right between this 3.6 and the 3.67 3.68. We're basically at the top of the range right now. Okay. It is then telling me that a stop loss over there. Amazing. Okay. And it's then telling me obviously TP areas higher in these zones over here. So risk-to-reward is good percentage- wise, what does this look like? It looks up to 22% for the shorter term targets. It does look up to 50% for the mid-term targets. And when it comes to stop-loss, right, again, you're looking at around two to 3% in stop-loss. When we break through, if we break through, right, the tops over here. Okay, the key is to move stop loss to entry. move remove the risk right as we go through look at Dash right Dash all started from a breakup trend a key break of a high right as we pop through we broke another trend yesterday and that's what started to send it I will not touch this but I am going to look at the recipe to show that even these type of coins are waking up ICP right ICP boom that was the entry boom that was the entry their stop-loss their stop loss right Money is moving, fast moves are happening. A breakout like that can show you up to 20% move in a short time frame. Now, the crazy thing is we look at ICP and we're like, okay, looking pretty good the last two days. You zoom out and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. [laughter] Where are we here? We are fishing at the bottom of the damn ocean here, right? It's quite crazy. Now, again, one thing that's very important is to know that I don't think this is all season run yet. I think this is just something that goes full parabolic yet. But there is hundreds of percents to be made. All right, just to show you guys here, you put in this major trend here. Boom. Okay, something like this makes sense. And what's crazy is a move like that is big, big, big percentages, right? The key here is not to chase though. So ICP, am I entering today? No. Right. I'm looking at what's just broken out. And Falcoin for me was quite exciting as well as ZK sync. But money is starting to move, right? It's exciting. Something we haven't seen in a long time. So if we look at the next one that we want to pay attention to is AA, right? A for me is getting ready for a nice push, right? If I look at a couple of key trends over here, there's the breakout. Okay. And for me, easily a push to the mid-range. Percentage wise, we look at where we are now. Where is buy zone? buy zone is to not chase when it's already pumped is okay. It's breaking out coming in for the retest. Your buys are between the 73 74 cents to the 77 cents, right? That's more or less the buy zone. Stop losses are anywhere in these areas of around 71 cents. Okay, so this one little bit more higher percentage on the risk. Let's have a look at what the risk looks like if it's buy right now around 5%. So this one a little bit more conservative, lower leverage or spot only, right? Then if we look at the percentage to the upside, a nice 30 to 40% move to the upside. Here's an opportunity. Here's an entry today, right? Which is looking really good. So again, we start to look and see that many of these tokens. Here's another one which was that where is it? Here we go. That light lighter which I was showing you guys and and explaining to you guys. Keep eyes on this one for a breakout. These are Dexes, right?"

That light lighter which I was showing you guys and and explaining to you guys. Keep eyes on this one for a breakout. These are Dexes, right? This one's still got a little bit of time. Hasn't broken out fully yet. Keep our eye out on the breakout, though. Another token. That's to say that is this today's token? Maybe. Maybe it breaks the trends today, but this thing might break in two days, right? So, if I ride the the file coin, get out, catch the lighter one next. You kind of want to keep moving, right? You kind of want to be a little bit of a player, right? When it comes to trading, move from coin to coin to coin. Have a couple one night stands, one day stands, two day stands, whatever it may be, and move on. Right, that's the important thing is to move on. Okay, let's go through more over here. There is just tons and tons and tons of alts just waking up everywhere. Uh, let's go through. Okay, so let's quickly start off with market. We got PPI coming out. Really good result yesterday of a pump, right? We spoke about this Bitcoin from 90,000 to 96,000, right? And we actually got a higher high on the daily. This is a very very very good sign. This is what I spoke about yesterday to say we're sitting in the middle. Okay, we were closer here down here yesterday. So guys, the next area we're going is here. And if we break through that area, the next area we're going is to the 100 and I have $108,000 as a target. Right? That's going to be crunch zone or if we are going to have a mega cycle this year. I'm hoping we break 108,000. If not, we got to prepare for uh more downside. Right? For now, we focus on buys, opportunities, and then we focus on taking money off the table and looking what's next. But what's quite clear here on Bitcoin is this. We have broken the high. So, I won't be surprised today if we decide to come and test and I won't be surprised in the next couple of days we start making our way to the $100,000 zone. Right? Very cool. Then when we look at obviously trends as we start to speed up the key iss to track that going up right and there is the key area. So right now our big supports or areas we don't want to lose $91,000 by putting in a trend we have these early signs here if there's any weakness in the markets. The market is looking strong as much as we have the past right the market is looking strong. We need to accept it. We need to use it and we need to manage our risk. That is the number one rule rule right now when it comes to altcoins. It has not even begun. Right? So there's alt has alt made a higher high. No, it has not. Right? So altcoins have not even started their short squeeze. The short squeeze happens once we break through these previous highs. Right? We broke the trend. Check. We retested the trend. Check. Third thing we need now is a new higher high. From that we're looking at a short squeeze. And you can see there is a big zone of where we go to next from here. And the crazy thing is if we do get up to this big area up here, that might be the dump basically back right as recovered. Okay. So, it's very interesting to see what's going to happen over these next uh um few uh weeks. One resistance that's holding us right now as we're making some sort of cup and handle is this one. Okay, that's why we are currently pausing. Okay, through here is a big one. So again, the key not to chase. The key is to buy support."

Okay, that's why we are currently pausing. Okay, through here is a big one. So again, the key not to chase. The key is to buy support. Buy good things with good risk areas. But pay attention for when this breaks out. There is a short squeeze coiling up, right? And it's going to be nice and aggressive. Bitcoin dominance, right? Had a little push up yesterday. It needed to get Bitcoin to go up first. Just remember where we are when it comes to the dominance. Remember where we are. We broke, we tested here. Very much likely I'll start to wake and that's because of obviously a couple of important tokens. The first one is ETH, right? We were in this flag. This flag we have now broken out of the flag, right? Which means that any pullbacks into these zones are hot zones for ETH. And it's very likely that we are going to go up first rather than any lower targets. And if we look at downside, there we go. big areas is now $3,100 is areas not to lose. Okay, it gives me a good idea of where to protect myself, but ultimately if I look at where ETH getting ready to possibly go is close to the $4,000 mark. Now again, this for me is a conservative strategy and just to show you guys here or conservative token, you know, these are tokens that I built for the long term now, right? We got ETH. ETH, we're up nearly 10% on the investment, right? Plus 0.3% on the grid profit, right? So for a little bit more of my longerterm conservative strategies, I am choosing the likies of ETH. But the good sign of ETH getting bullish is obviously that um alcoins right join the party too. So bullish ETH helps us keep the dominance down, helps us with diversification of money moving outside of Bitcoin into alcoins. If we look at a couple of the bot performers, Pump Fund, I spoke about Pump. I did a show on the weekend. Um, this is up 26% plus 4% on the grid profits, right? Oh, sorry, never mind. 26 is total 22% of P&L, 4% on the grid profits. So, you can see by having the bots, you're getting two two things that are building your positions, right? If we look at the next year, there's Salano is up 12%, right? ETH is up 9%, Avac is up 9%, Cardano is up 11%. So the bot portfolio starting to recover, starting to look good, um, nice and strong, which is amazing. Okay, let's now jump back into charts. So again, what am I expecting today? Small pullback and a continue of the pump. Right, I'm expecting markets to pull down a little bit, not much. And I am expecting us to start making our way up to higher areas over the next couple of days. Right, here's pump fund. No entries, gone for now. Unless you like the investment side of it. For me, I'm already invested. I'm in. Right? We gone. So, you got to understand something. When markets reset, restart, start moving up again, right? You start losing entries one by one. Pump fund for me now is uh is gone, right? Dash is gone. Is definitely gone. Right? But you see that these things start crossing and it's just not worth entering them anymore. But it's a good example of why we wait for the break, the retest, and what we're looking at buying. Let me know if you guys Oh, you like the haircut. I went a little bit uh young school here. I was starting to look uh uh little bit older, so I needed to to freshen it up a little bit. Got the curls going. Uh natural curls, I think. Um I think I'm a mixed breed. I really do. I think I have like I had such a ginger beard as well. U so I literally think I'm from all parts of the world."

U so I literally think I'm from all parts of the world. I don't even know where I'm from. Um, very much a mixed breed. Okay, let's now go through the next big opportunities. I spoke about AVAC. Great pump from Avac, right? Avac has not even started it short squeeze yet. This is still a token I'm very interesting specifically for high time frame. Right, Avac after this, we are looking for pushes up into the mid20s. So I do think there's up to a 50 60% strong move incoming um for AAX right let's see how chain link's doing same thing with chain link right chain link breakout broke out of this trend retested and now are looking for a break so again I think the important thing here is blue chips blue chip blue chips and conservative strategies get those entries first before you just care about leverage positions and all these different things get the blue chip positions right for me chain link is still a big on okay that I've always been accumulating okay and again I'm not too focused trading this on the short time frame I think there's a lot of other opportunities short time time frame but I don't want to lose this position right once we start breaking through here we start to get ready to go back into the 20s right there's big opportunity there and I don't have to risk too much of my cash right and all that I'm doing is all these previous lows here that we made is very much like in my stop-loss areas so I am putting stop losses on 95% of my entire portfolio, right? I'm just getting to the habit of stop losses. Give them space, but have them in. I never want a 10th of October situation ever again. Ever to wipe 30% to 50% of my portfolio in minutes. I am never doing that again. It was terrible. All right. Was not fun. Okay, let's go through the next opportunities. One for me that has still not taken off properly, but he's on the other side of the trend. He's still fetch. Keep eyes on this. The move will come right. Good opportunity. Nice stop loss area is around 24 cents. 23 24 cents. I see Renda is getting ready for another push. I do think high time frame render is a big opportunity. This has been coming down for a long time. Although since 2024, right, late 2024, we are retesting a strength coming back to render. keep eyes on this and I am seeing a push of $5 at any point. Yes, 10th of October was not the greatest day of our lives but experience right it will make sense one day. Okay, next one that has broken out um is Algarand. So, ALGO's broken out. Pay attention now. We don't chase pumps. We buy support. We're coming into support. Keep that in mind. If you want to trade that leverage trade it as an example, put the trend in, track it down, buy the breaker trend, put a stop loss below the low once it breaks the trend, right? Keep that in mind. Okay. How are my positions? We're back at entries here. Okay. Back at entries on file. File. For me, it's important to just get through these stop losses. Get through the stops. Get through the stops. I got it. 5 point 1.56. Let's actually quickly just go through it so you guys are not left with a full understanding here. If this does not hold this area here, it means and I'm still very much interested. It does mean we're coming down to the low 1.5s and that will be something that I'm interested in. Okay. But we just broke out, retested. This would be an entry. Stop loss 1.5 1.56. Right. I'm in that one."

But we just broke out, retested. This would be an entry. Stop loss 1.5 1.56. Right. I'm in that one. That is the one position I want to pass these bfunded accounts and there's multiple accounts that I want to pass. Okay, now let's go through more of tokens. Let's go through Zcash. Zcash, I do think Zcash created a bit of damage for itself longer term. Um, I would not very much enter this. Okay, let's see. Maybe there is an entry. Okay, there could be a soft entry here. We just broke out here. There's the entry. stop loss here tight. I'm seeing a push to around the 47480 and then I do see a bit of a drop. So, this could be a nice trade if the risk makes sense. Okay, but and those are kind of holding. If you're a bit worried, this could be a nice little offload zone. High time frame, I just think it's going to take a little bit of time, but I do think it's still very bullish. I'm not I'm not bearish on this. I think there's a very big bull flag in play. Okay. And I think what first has to happen is a push up, push down, and then a push up again. Right. So, keep eyes. I do think ZK is good and I do think it's good area to accumulate um anywhere between the 300 400. Um but pay attention to obviously the big breaks to the upside. Okay. The next one I want to pay attention to is Aweave. There's a Rweave breakout that is happening right. We are breaking out nice and strong and you can see we're starting to pop our head through over there. Right. I would like to see a closer side this trend. This is a token that's showing strength and for me there is a push getting ready up to the six to $6.2 mark on the midtime frame obviously high time frame looking at a lot more opportunity. Uh let's go over here and go see what this market is bringing. I see memecoins are waking up. Um I see a which I spoke about earlier in the beginning of the show is waking up nicely. Um, what else is new over here? See, H bar has got some strength. I see a couple of um Salana ecosystem tokens. Um, there's Polka Dots. I want to bring up Polka Dot as well. Let's see what DOT is doing right now. Okay, nice little break on DOT. Let's just see key break. Okay, so again, every big area we've broken are areas of supports if you wanted to look for trades for these tokens. Doesn't look like the pullback will be that aggressive on this. And it does look like opportunity after these areas over here. This could easily be a 50% move after this to the upside. All right. Okay. Let's go. Next one. I want to see hyperlquid because definitely the dexus for me is quite quite important. So we we'll look at hyperlquid now. Let's look at har give me in the chats guys what tokens you want me to chart for you let me know. Okay so arbitrum let's have a look. Let's pop a couple of these on. So har. Okay, let's put OB. Okay, let's go. Next one. XLM. I do want to see XLM as well. XLM and XRP like to run together. Looks like XLM sometimes leads the pump. Let's look at XRP. The army will always be there. Stop. Okay, H bar. Let's have a look at H bar. So, where are we with key trends? We have that trend over there. We have that one that we broke through and retested and we have this one over here. It's probably why we are pausing right now. Yeah, just keep eye for this breakout breakout around 134 cents. I think there'll be some good opportunities on H bar."

Okay, let's put OB. Okay, let's go. Next one. XLM. I do want to see XLM as well. XLM and XRP like to run together. Looks like XLM sometimes leads the pump. Let's look at XRP. The army will always be there. Stop. Okay, H bar. Let's have a look at H bar. So, where are we with key trends? We have that trend over there. We have that one that we broke through and retested and we have this one over here. It's probably why we are pausing right now. Yeah, just keep eye for this breakout breakout around 134 cents. I think there'll be some good opportunities on H bar. Arbitum is breaking out. Everything is getting ready for the short squeeze. Okay. So, we want to get on this side. So, if you like, let's say, this token, let it pop. Buy it there. Right. That's it. But make sure you don't miss them. If they break those trends, that's when things start to move very quick. Um, when it comes to XLM, same thing. Not looking too bad. There's the resistance. Let's get it through. Go. It's exciting to see altcoin start to get on that side though. XRP looking okay right now. Not the the craziest and uh the greatest guys. Remember BDCC, right? Remember that we can trade uh stock tokens as well. So, I'm very much getting to stocks at this point. Um crypto's obviously waking up. So, my love comes back at the moment. I want to cheat on her. Not cheat on her, but kind of move on. Uh yes, I was like a first time ever I'm gonna trade stocks, right? 24 hours later, we have a 20% pump in all coins. Love it. Um but I'm not going to lose the fact of that. So remember when you go here to markets, there is links below. Let me just show you guys here. We have the BDC link. Okay, we have um the sniper club link. Join sniper club. Right, we got a couple of the guys that are killing it in club. Here's Israel as example. sculpers dream right now this market he's been ripping ripping he actually gave a couple of trades this morning and he's got a car short in play so we see the markets pull back on the short time frames he was calling all the shorts hours ago right but he's been absolutely crushing it this is in club we have Craig's trades in here's trades Matt's trades OG Bruce's trades right this club is pumping right it's doing incredibly well so make sure you do join it click on the link below click here it is free for you to join. Don't lose those opportunities. There is the BDCC link over here. And here's all the bots as well for Pionex. And here is Bitfunded. I luckily for 24 more hours, I still got you guys the deal. You buy one get one free. Luckily 24 hours. You want to buy any accounts, any packages, that is where you get it with the link below in the description. Okay, let's see. Where else are we seeing strength? What are we seeing, Maddie? What do people want to see, brother V? >> We got some of the guys asking for ICP. >> Yeah, beginning of the show, guys. I did speak about I'll speak about again quickly. Uh, what did I speak about? Let's go through it. So, there's ICP just breaking out, which is good. Um, so again, if you kind of look at risk, your buyers are looking here between this 3.6 and 3.8, right? So, it's a little bit higher time frame or more conservative buys. Not too much crazy leverage buys on this at the moment for me. Um, but I am seeing a pump up easily to $7. So, I do think there is big opportunity um on ICP. What else we seeing there, Maddie? >> They want to know ENA. >> ENA. Okay. Yes. Let's go through ENA. Same thing, guys. This market is literally one 10% move away from going crazy and giving 50 100% gains. They're all sitting right there at resistance. Right from there, big opportunity. So, keep that in mind. Um, put all these key trends in. Yes. And then I'm expecting half range pumps. So, something like this up to the 55 to the 60 cent mark. Okay guys, I need to jump. Why? I am shooting passing Bitfunner challenges for my other channel."
