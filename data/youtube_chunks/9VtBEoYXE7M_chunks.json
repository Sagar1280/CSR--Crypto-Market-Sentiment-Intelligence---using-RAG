      "text": "This crypto cycle should have been the biggest \none ever. Large cap cryptos like BTC, ETH,   and XRP hit new all-time highs, and narratives \nlike tokenization took off. Regulation was better   than ever, and investors now have easy access to \ncrypto through spot ETFs. But despite everything   seemingly going right for the industry, it looks \nlike the buyers never showed up in size. So today,   we're holding up a mirror to crypto, asking why \nthe hypes felt so muted and tackling the question   on everyone's mind. Where are all the investors? My name is Lewis and let's dive in. Before we   begin though, I'm not a financial adviser and \nnothing in this video is financial or investment   advice. It's educational content intended to \nexplore the surprising absence of crypto inflows. If that sounds good, then punch that like button \nand let's get into it. Now, back in 2021, everyone   was buzzing about crypto's cuttingedge tech and \nthe possibilities that came with it. Memecoin   moonshots were everywhere. NFTts had taken over \nprofile pictures, and even your technophobic uncle   was buying VR headsets to explore the metaverse. Like all good things, though, the 2021 bull market   came to an end. Some people walked away from \ncrypto for good, while others stuck it out through   one of the most brutal bare markets ever. And \nthat was fine because they knew that the next bull   market would be even bigger. and better than the \nlast. Or so they thought. Despite all the progress   made around crypto market structure, regulation, \neducation, and marketing, retail excitement just   hasn't shown up, especially compared to previous \ncycles. This is evident across several metrics. For starters, exchange trading volumes haven't \nexperienced the same parabolic surge seen in 2021. Even when volumes spiked this cycle as BTC \nreached new all-time highs in 2025, they remained   well below 2021 levels, signaling low retail \ninvestment. Google search trends confirmed this   with search terms like crypto, cryptocurrency, and \neven Bitcoin being at multi-year lows. Although,   intriguingly, search trends for things \nlike stable coins, tokenization, and RWA   are actually at multi-year highs, which indicates \nmore institutional interest. More on that later. Anyway, another indicator of low investor interest \ncan be found onchain. As you might have heard,   the number of active Bitcoin addresses has been \ngradually declining over time. As I record this,   the active Bitcoin address count sits at roughly \n650,000, about 50% down from its peak of around   1.3 million back in April of 2021. For what \nit's worth, the number of Bitcoin shrimps,   while it's holding less than one BTC, has been \nsteadily rising, which could be a sign that   existing investors in the crypto market have been \nturning their focus towards Bitcoin. Evidence for   this can be found in Ethereum's onchain data. If we track wallets with small ETH holdings,   you'll notice a sharp drop off after July 2022 \nwith little recovery since. Since Ethereum is   the largest altcoin, it serves as a proxy for the \nbroader altcoin market. And the data clearly shows   that attention remains far more focused on Bitcoin \nrather than altcoins. This is also reflected in   Bitcoin dominance, which has been in a long-term \nuptrend since August 2022. But it's worth noting   that Bitcoin dominance began falling last \nsummer. If Bitcoin dominance continues to fall,   this could either signal more money flowing into \naltcoins or into stable coins and tokenized assets   as they become a bigger sector of the market. In \nany case, there are plenty of other indicators we   could point to, but you get the idea. Investors \nhaven't been as excited about crypto this cycle. This doesn't mean that it's not possible to make \nmoney, though. Many retail investors have found   that trading crypto is a great way to make gains \nregardless of market conditions. And if you are   trading crypto, then you have to check out the \nCoinbau deals page. That's where you'll find   exchange signup bonuses of up to $100,000, trading \nfee discounts of up to 50% and deposit cash backs   of up to 75% on the best crypto exchanges. Just \nhit the link in the description or scan this QR   code which will take you right to the deals page. There you'll see all of our offers across a range   of exchange partners. Then click one of the sign \nup now buttons and that should take you right to   the deal. These deals won't be around forever, \nthough, so take advantage of them while you can   using the link in the description below or by \nscanning the QR code. So, where have all of the   investors gone? Or more accurately, why haven't \nwe seen the same euphoric rush of retail investors   FOMOing into the latest shiny thing? Was it \nsomething we said? Was it something we did?"

Or more accurately, why haven't we seen the same euphoric rush of retail investors FOMOing into the latest shiny thing? Was it something we said? Was it something we did? Was Harry Potter Obama Sonic 1 Enu just one step \ntoo far? I mean, maybe. But that's not really the   problem here. For many, the reason they're keeping \ntheir distance from crypto this cycle is simple. They still have PTSD from the 2022 crash. I am, \nof course, talking about the collapse of FTX,   which rocked the entire market and triggered a \ncascade of major crypto companies going under in   its wake. The FTX collapse remains one of the most \ncatastrophic failures in crypto history, leaving   long-asting damage across the industry. Beyond \nthe billions lost, it left a stain on crypto's   reputation. stain were still trying to erase. Retail investors who lived through it remember the   fallout all too well, while those who didn't have \nlikely heard enough to stay away. Some may never   return. Thanks a lot, Sam. But to be fair, we \ncan't blame everything on SPF. It's easy to forget   that many retail investors had already left by the \nsummer of 2022 due to the collapse of Terara's US   stable coin, which ultimately led to the collapse \nof other large players in the crypto industry,   such as Celsius and set the stage for FTX's own \ncollapse. If the collapse of entities like Terra,   Celsius, and FTX were the factors that pushed \ninvestors away from crypto, then the rally in   stocks, especially tech and AI focused ones, and \ncommodities like gold and silver were factors   that pushed investors towards other assets. And honestly, who could blame them? The trend   is your friend, as they say. And many investors \nhave decided to follow the strong trend of AI   and gold rather than wait for crypto. Now, one of \nthe biggest reasons this cycle feels so different   is because of something we touched on earlier. A lot of capital is coming into crypto through   ETFs. Basically, ETFs give traditional investors a \nway to gain indirect crypto exposure in a simpler,   more regulated way. But here's where things get \ninteresting. According to a coin shares report   from Q1 last year, just 23% of US ETF shares were \nheld by institutions. Logically, this means that   the rest were held by retail investors like you \nand me. This is significant because it shows more   people are taking advantage of the simplicity and \nregulatory certainty that ETFs offer. In other   words, retail investors are still here. They're \njust investing differently than before. On top   of that, onchain data shows cryptonative whales \nbuying even as retail investors sell. For context,   some analysts argue that tracking whales is \nmore important than tracking retail because   a single whale can shift the entire market. This \nis significant because when whales scoop up crypto   that retailers dumped, it's the retail investors \nwho get left behind when the markets eventually   rallies. This trend has been happening for some \ntime, but there has been a huge divergence since   mid December. This could simply be because retail \ninvestors were selling their crypto getting ready   for the holidays, giving whales a chance to scoop \nit up. Whatever the reason though, whale influence   is growing while retail influence is shrinking. And to make matters worse, much of the remaining   retail capital has been lost in the PVP gambling \narena of memecoins. In the first half of 2025,   while whales and institutions double down on \nmajor cryptos like BTC and ETH, retail investors   were distracted chasing memecoin gains. The result \nwas that the memecoin sector became flooded with   thousands of new tokens every single day thanks to \nlaunchpads like Pump. Fun that let anyone create   a token in seconds at almost no cost. Traders \nscrambled to get in before a pump, then raced   to sell for a profit, and it all happened \nincredibly fast."

Traders scrambled to get in before a pump, then raced to sell for a profit, and it all happened incredibly fast. Case in point, an October   2025 report from Galaxy Digital revealed that the \nmedian hold time for meme coins on Salana, where   most of the action was, was just 100 seconds, \nnot hours, not minutes, seconds. Eventually,   fatigue set in. Investors grew tired of the pump \nand dumps, the bots, the snipers, and the mental   strain of watching charts constantly. This was \nmade worse by crypto's largest ever liquidation   event on October 10th, which sent risk appetites \nplummeting. That's because the event exposed flaws   in small cap altcoin liquidity and the dangers \nof leveraged positions. Intriguingly though,   memecoin mania might be making a comeback. Recent \ndata shows an uptick in social media activity   around memecoins since the start of 2026. At the \nsame time, the total crypto market cap has risen,   suggesting investors may be regaining an appetite \nfor risk. Now, if there's one thing that we can   agree on, it's that the lack of new retail \ninvestors is why this bull market has felt so,   well, boring. The speculative frenzy that \nonce drew new investors has been replaced   by muted institution-led flows that move \nprices without real excitement. What once   felt like a cultural shift now feels more like \na professional balance sheet adjustment. Sure,   it could still be profitable, but the euphoria \nof past crypto bull runs just isn't there. In the previous bull markets, the same pattern \nwould play out. BTC would hit new all-time highs,   pushing the fear and greed index into greed \nterritory and putting Bitcoin on the radar   for investors everywhere, both inside and outside \nof crypto. As crypto made mainstream headlines,   investors would FOMO in, chasing higher returns \nin altcoins, often causing newer retail investors   to ape in right at the top. However, this \npattern hasn't played out in this bull market. Retail capital has been weaker, fragmented, and \nmore focused on high-risisk bets like memecoins   or short-term narratives. While attention on these \nareas can be bullish for the cryptos within them,   it doesn't create the upward pressure needed for \nthe broader crypto market. Nor does it generate   the FOMO of past cycles. The real underlying \nwinners of this cycle have actually been   layer 1's utilitydriven projects and most \nnotably tokenized real world assets or RWAs. As you'll probably know, Wall Street and other \ninstitutions are racing to put assets on chain,   unlocking new opportunities. Opportunities that \ncould earn them some serious bank. The biggest   winner here was stable coins, the most widely \nused type of RWA. For context, stable coins are   tokenized dollars, mainly backed by short-term \nUS treasuries. 2025 was monumental for their   growth thanks to regulations like the EU's Mika \nbill and the US Genius Act, pushing the stable   coin market cap up nearly 50% in just one year. But it wasn't just regulation. Stable coins also   became an integral part of fintech payment rails \nlike Stripe, PayPal, and more. Taken together,   this allowed the stable coin market to reach \nmore than $300 billion by December. To be clear,   this is huge. The growth of the RWA sector, stable \ncoins or otherwise, is a clear sign that crypto   is on track for mainstream adoption. That said, \nit's not exactly thrilling for retail investors. Stable coins aren't exactly going to pump anyone's \nbags. And let's be honest, are people really going   to lose their minds over a tokenized government \ntreasury? Probably not. All right, folks. So,   so far we've faced some uncomfortable truths \nand done some hard self-reflection. Admittedly,   it's starting to feel a bit doom and gloom, but \nthere is still plenty to be excited about. So,   let's flip the script and tackle the question on \neveryone's mind. Will retail hype ever return? Well, the good news is that yes, it will. While things might feel a bit meh right now,   retail investors are bound to come back for one \nsimple reason, and that's greed."

So, so far we've faced some uncomfortable truths and done some hard self-reflection. Admittedly, it's starting to feel a bit doom and gloom, but there is still plenty to be excited about. So, let's flip the script and tackle the question on everyone's mind. Will retail hype ever return? Well, the good news is that yes, it will. While things might feel a bit meh right now, retail investors are bound to come back for one simple reason, and that's greed. Human greed has   no limits, and it's also one of the biggest \ndrivers of market activity. As crypto prices   reach key psychological levels, this will grab the \nattention of the masses, prompting many investors   to ape back into crypto. These key levels could be \nBTC reclaiming 100K or even hitting new all-time   highs of say 130,000. Or it could be Ethereum \nbreaking above 5K or the total crypto market   cap climbing back over 4 trillion. And it's worth \nnoting that in recent weeks, market sentiment has   turned more positive. So, these targets might not \nbe as far-fetched as they seem. Alternatively,   retail investors could feel the FOMO if prices \nhave been going up for a sustained period of time,   or they might turn to crypto if other assets like \ngold or AI stocks start to cool off. In that case,   investors would chase higher upside potential, \nand crypto will likely be one of the first   places that they'd look. And believe it or \nnot, retail investors could get swept up in   the hype sooner than you expect. As we touched \non earlier, the memecoin space is showing some   signs of revival. After dropping 65% in 2025, \nmemecoins are resurfacing on social media,   and some tokens are seeing massive gains \nagain. This potentially signals a renewed   risk appetite among retail investors, potentially \nsparking the same contagion effect that drew in   new market participants last cycle. And in the \nlonger term, another factor that will seriously   attract new retail investors is if the next US \npresidency is also pro crypto. Hypothetically,   if the Democrats win the midterm elections and \ndon't reverse the regulatory progress made so far,   this would reassure skeptical retail investors \nthat crypto isn't a partisan issue. But even if   retail FOMO doesn't kick in immediately, there are \nstill plenty of opportunities in the meantime. As   Bitcoin has become more institutionalized, the \nmarket has grown less volatile. On the surface,   that might sound boring, but it actually has \nsome benefits. That's because institutional   capital has been lapping up Bitcoin while everyone \nelse has been selling, making it a powerful buffer   against retail panic selling. This is great news \nfor both traders and investors. For investors,   it makes holding a more viable strategy since BTC \nis likely to rise over the long term. For traders,   the added stability makes BTC's price action more \npredictable, making it easier to plan and execute   profitable trading strategies. The point is, \nthis lack of retail interest is likely temporary. Eventually, people will be scrambling to chase the \nnext pump that could bring life-changing gains. And the best news is that you're already better \npositioned simply because you're still here. So,   while things might feel a little gray now, the \nfuture still looks bright. Okay, folks, that's   quite enough for me. Now, we want to hear from \nyou. Are your friends still talking about crypto,   or are you the only one left? Let us know in the \ncomments below. If you want to learn more about   the rotation from gold into Bitcoin, then check \nout that video right over here. And if you're   wondering what are the top trends to watch in \n2026, then check out this video right over here. Thank you all so much for watching and I'll see \nyou again very soon.
