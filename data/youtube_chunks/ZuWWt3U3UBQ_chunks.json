      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse. Today we're going to talk about Bitcoin, an unfortunate outlook. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and check out into the cryptoverse premium at intothecryptoverse.com. Also, I wanted to let you know that I've launched a new website. It's not really um that surprising, but it's just called benjamancow.com. So, you know, if you want to collaborate, like if you want me to go on your channel uh or if you want me to speak at a conference or anything like that, uh this would be where to go. So, just my name.com, bjamin.com. So, I want to talk a little bit here about an unfortunate outlook, right? And basically there there's a pattern forming and we've seen it form many times. Now some of these patterns for some of the assets that we're about to talk about I don't really know how many times I've shared them on the public channel. Mostly I think we've focused on some of them on on the private channel but some of them you will recognize. And unfortunately there's a similar pattern that it seems like is is playing out with Bitcoin but it's not on the actual Bitcoin chart. So, you have to dig a little bit deeper to understand like what it is that I'm seeing, which again is probably why I have a case of the bare market blues and one of the reasons why I've talked before about how there's a good chance we'll see Bitcoin bleed into the summer even if there is a counter trend rally at some point, you know, in the first quarter of of the year. So, the pattern is very familiar. We've seen it happen. I've seen it happen on multiple charts and I've honestly used it to make some pretty good trades on on a lot of these different charts. Now, some of them are more indirect, but one of them comes from the Bitcoin dominance chart. Do you see here? And I know you're wondering, how does this relate back to this unfortunate pattern? We'll show you in a minute. Do you see this Bitcoin dominance pattern? how there was like these lows set and then it would just kind of come back up to these highs and then once it broke through it got a pullback and then it just ran for a while. So I want you to remember that pattern. Okay, remember that pattern of setting lows having some highs and then breaking through re back testing a little and then running. Remember that. Now this happened on the Bitcoin dominance chart and the rest is history. I mean, altcoins just bled to Bitcoin for years after that. Now, there's some other charts where this came up as well in other industries before we get to the one that I want to talk about that relates to crypto. Okay, the HSI, the Hang Singh index over in China, very similar pattern where you have these lows, you have the highs, you break the high right here, you break through, you come back down, form the macro higher low, and then you run. Same thing. We have seen it another time, right? I about what four or five months ago we showed the same pattern uh with palladium. You guys remember that? I'm sure many of you do. Uh we did a video on palladium called dubious speculation. Uh when you know we we have we we noticed all these prior breakout attempts. But it was this one we took notice of and I made a video when Palladium was around 1,080 or so about 5 or 6 months ago saying that we were likely going to have this massive breakout to the upside following the HSI pattern and following the Bitcoin dominance pattern. Now, there's a lot of charts that you'll see this exact same pattern on, but the one that I see right now is very unfortunate. And what I think and look I I know it's not popular, right? Like I I know that when I express these views, I'm not necessarily making myself any friends, but at the end of the day, all I'm here to do is to present the evidence for where I think the market is going to go. And for a long time, we talked about the fourth quarter of the post having year for Bitcoin. Now, is it true that the super cycle guys could be right? Yeah, like it's possible. I'm not saying it's impossible. Maybe you would assign like a 20 to 30% chance of something like that happening."

I'm not saying it's impossible. Maybe you would assign like a 20 to 30% chance of something like that happening. But what I think is difficult for me right now is obviously we've talked about Bitcoin topping on apathy rather than euphoria and and kind of mimicking the 2019 downturn uh in in a very similar pattern. like we've talked about that a lot and and if you actually go look at um you know if if you look at the 2019 bare market and you compare it to the current one you can see we're we're actually tracking it pretty closely and as I said before we topped on apathy rather than euphoria which is exactly what happened in 2019 which also occurred right around the time that quantitative tightening ended. So those are already reasons why while I think counterturn rallies are possible, I think it makes sense to assume there will be sort of a lower low coming uh by the summer. But there's a new chart that we have to look at and it follows this Padium pattern. It follows the HSI pattern, the same pattern we've seen many, many times. And it follows the Bitcoin dominance pattern. Every one of those patterns ultimately broke through and continued to trend higher. And the unfortunate chart is stable coin dominance. That is the unfortunate chart because if you go look and we're just going to approximate here with USDT dominance and USDC dominance. We're not going to add in all the other stable coins because I don't really think we need to to make the point. If you look at stable coin dominance appro approximated by UST dominance and USDC dominance, what you'll notice is a very familiar pattern. A pattern where you have the lows and you have the highs. But guess what just happened? Bitcoin went up earlier, right? But then as it dropped into October, November, December, stable coin dominance broke through these highs. Now remember what happened when Bitcoin dominance and the HSI and Platium, remember when they broke through the high on that first move, they then got a pullback, which is exactly where we are right now. We're in the pullback, right? We're in the pullback of stable coin dominance. The problem is while all of those charts had the pullback after sweeping above the high, they then ran after that, right? Bitcoin dominance ran after that. Palladium ran after that and the HSI ran after that. They all went up after breaking through and after the pullback. So the unfortunate argument that that I have to make and guys the thing is is like if you're an investor you have to recognize something is that throughout your investing career whether you like it or not right for crypto right and and for other assets as well but crypto is the one I'm making the argument about right now there will be bare markets right like there will be it's not a matter of if there will be a bare market it's just when is there going to be a bare market and the reason why it's important to identify bare markets is that so you have some cash to take advantage when the bare market happens. Remember, bull markets make you money. Bare markets make you rich. The people that got rich on Bitcoin this cycle were the people that bought in late 2022, not the people that FOMOed in at like 80K, right? I mean, if they bought at 80K and watched it go up, you know, 20 30% or something like it's not as big of a deal. It was more than I guess 20 or 30 from that point because we went to 126. But it's not as big of a deal. If you bought at 15K and Bitcoin goes up to 126, those people, a lot of them got rich that with that strategy. But if you waited, you didn't."

But it's not as big of a deal. If you bought at 15K and Bitcoin goes up to 126, those people, a lot of them got rich that with that strategy. But if you waited, you didn't. And the people that got rich were the people that had the courage to buy when no one else wanted to buy. the end of 2022, just like there were people that bought at the end of 2018 and the end of 2014. If there is to be a bare market and we're to have these opportunities again, then the end of 2026 has to be on our radar as a potential entry. Now, if the super cycle guys are right and I'm wrong about this and and you know, Bitcoin just goes parabolic and and and screams higher, then it would likely be that late 2026 would not be as good of an opportunity. But if the cycle plays out like it always does and the four-year cycle remains intact, then arguably sometime mid to late year would be a relatively good entry into Bitcoin. The problem right now is, you know, we just had three months down. We're obviously having some sort of a counter trend move. We said this was likely going to happen regardless, right? You have three months down in 2021, 2022, then you got a reprieve before the bare market continued. Same thing in 2019. 3 months down, then you had a one-mon move up, and then we continued down. It's not like we haven't seen this story before like this. We've read I've read this story many, many times. So when you look at a chart like this, if you are to be objective about it and leave the bias at the door and you're just to be objective and you didn't even know what the chart was, you probably would look at this chart and say it looks kind of bullish, right? It looks like you had these highs and now we've kind of broken through and there's a there's a consolidation. There's like a brief pullback after breaking through. We saw the same thing happen with all those other charts. It wasn't a bearish sign that it got a pullback, right? Like when Bitcoin dominance broke through it, it wasn't bearish that it had this pullback back down below the high. Like that was not a bearish thing. It was just kind of the final pullback before definitively and more durably breaking through. So, when you look at stable coin dominance, I don't really view this pullback as a a bearish view for stable coin dominance. I just think it's kind of the the the necessary consolidation pullback before it likely goes a lot higher. Some of these assets that we've talked about with this pattern had much deeper pullbacks, right? Like palladium actually had a pullback all the way back down to the bull market support band, right? like it it broke through the highs and then and then it had that pullback and it ended up dropping back to the 20week moving average. So when you look at like stable coin dominance and you look to see like where is the bull market support band, it's currently at around 7.5 to 7.8% and right now stable coin dominance is 8.5. Now I can't tell you if it's going to go all the way back down here. I don't know. I I don't know if it is. If you again if you look at at Bitcoin dominance the pullback was a lot less. You know it's not like Bitcoin dominance had a pullback to the bull market support band after getting that initial pullback. It just went through and then it got the pull back to the bull market support band as it kind of back tested the prior highs. So I don't want to give you the impression that it absolutely has to drop back down here before then going up. It might just go up and then drop and then run."

So I don't want to give you the impression that it absolutely has to drop back down here before then going up. It might just go up and then drop and then run. The point is is that when you think about is this cycle different, right? Like is the four-year cycle different just because we topped on apathy rather than euphoria. And when I look at a chart like this, when I look at stable coin dominance, to me, it looks like it wants to break out. It like wants to go higher. And if it wants to go higher, then that means the dominance of everything else drops. Right? It means it drops. Not necessarily everything. Like there's a chance that Bitcoin dominance could go up and altcoin dominance goes down. There's a chance that everything Bitcoin dominance and altcoins go down as stable coin dominance goes up. But to me, this is an unfortunate pattern that happens to be presenting itself at the beginning of the midterm year. And we know that all prior bare markets for Bitcoin occurred starting in the fourth quarter of the post election year. All of them, right? The fourth quarter of the postelection year. And then you had that initial draw down, a reprieve, and then really setting into the bear. Every single time you get your initial draw down, your reprieve, and then you really get into the bear, the crypto winter, if you will. So you could argue argue that look the good news is if this is a bare market we've already had the initial draw down. Now we're potentially in our brief reprieve stage before it continues into the depths of the bare market. But I just want people to see this analysis now rather than wish they had seen it in say 9 months or 6 months or something. Now listen guys at the end of the day you know no one knows what's going to happen. I can't sit here and with a clear conscience tell you that for a fact we're in a bare market. Right? There's always a chance that I am am misreading the situation. There's always a chance. But I do feel the obligation to alert you guys to these patterns. Like I don't want to pretend like they don't exist just because they're inconvenient, if that makes sense, right? Like I'd rather tell you an inconvenient truth than feed you a lie. Because at the end of the day, you know, if if the people that sort of just feed lies constantly, while it might make their audience feel good in the short term, it degrades it erodess confidence over the long term. Right? So this is why this entire cycle I told you guys to fade all season, right? because I would rather tell you the truth than an inconvenient truth than tell you a lie. And you can see that all Bitcoin pairs had just dropped for years. So, I know it's hard. I know it's hard and I think there will be better times in the cryptoverse in the future. And it's possible that Bitcoin's rally continues here. Like it's not impossible that that it it it it goes back up. Like it might, but the point is is that I would ultimately expect any rallies to be met with macro lower highs at either the 50week moving average or the bull market support band. That will then mark the macro lower high that will then definitively send us kind of into the bare market going into the summer. at which point there might be some pretty good opportunities to accumulate. Just notice that a lot of these prior bare markets, whether you want to look at 2022, whether you want to look at 2019 or 2018, right, or 2014, they had their macro lower highs. They had those and and during those macro lower highs, it brought a lot of people back in."

They had those and and during those macro lower highs, it brought a lot of people back in. it made them think that it was returning to normal and then it just led simply to a lower low. So that's what I think that's how I think it's going to play out, right? I I think that USDT dominance plus USDC dominance, my guess is that within a few months, it'll be a lot higher than it is right now. Right now, we're kind of in that initial pullback after stable coin dominance has broken out, right? It broke out. We're in the pullback period. After this pullback is over, whether it bottoms here or whether it goes to the bull market support, that I think is when more people start to accept a bare market. As I've said before though, by the time they accept it, the bare market could actually be over, right? It could be um it is just something it is something to to think about, right? Um so for me right now I I think that this is an unfortunate pattern. I'm not 100% sure that it's a bare market, but sometimes if it s if it looks like a bare market, it smells like a bare. I mean, if it if it quacks like one, it probably is one, you know, and this is one of those unfortunate patterns that does in fact provide evidence that it is a bare market. Now, if you would like to have a discussion about that, then perhaps take a look at this chart. What am I missing? Right? Like, what am I missing on this chart that would would sort of make me believe that it's still a bull market? I mean, I don't know. I mean, how how often does a chart do something like this where it has these like massive bottoms and and you have a a breakout and then a pullback? How often does this just continue to go higher versus how often does it actually come back down again? I mean, I guess it's not impossible for it to come back down again. If you look at Bitcoin dominance, I suppose it came down several times, but at the same time, you know, where the the the last time that it broke when it when it actually broke through, you can see here, it actually swept the high over here, whereas the times where it came back down, it wasn't actually sweeping the high. So, if you look at stable coin dominance, you can see that it's actually swept the high, right? like it's gone above the prior highs, which makes me think the market is showing us the direction it wants to go, right? Like stable coin dominance wants to go higher. I just don't know that everyone's accepted it yet. So, my guess is it's going to do something like this. Stable coin dominance will go higher into the summer and then hopefully better opportunities will present themselves.
