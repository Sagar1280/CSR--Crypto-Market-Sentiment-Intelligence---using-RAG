      "text": "Now, I had this conversation coming for a long \ntime with Andrew Weiner, a friend of mine who   spent the past decade growing crypto exchanges and \nonboarding 50 million plus users globally. He's   the former VP of MEXC Global and the current Chief \nOperating Officer of WEEX. But not only that,   he is in my opinion a mega brain in crypto. Now, he believes that in the next three   years a hundred trillion worth of assets will be \ntokenized on-chain. But what chains? Why? What   timeline? What tokens? That is the question. And \nthat is what we're going to talk about in this   show. If you enjoy this interview, smash the \nlike and without further ado, let's get going. I'm so happy that you're here and we're going to \njust rent this thing out because you are, and I   say this rarely, almost never, but you are one of \nthe smartest guys I know in the space. Every time   I talk to you, it's always blowing my mind. And \nwe've been back and forth on this for like what,   for three months, four months, five months \nthat we should get this interview going and   just talk it out. So, I'm super happy to have \nyou here on the channel. I'm super happy to   make this happen. There's a lot of \nthings that we need to cover. So,   yeah, brother, thanks for being here. In a \nfew words for people who don't know who you   are. Can you just introduce yourself and what \nyou do and why they should listen to all the   crazy stuff we're going to go through? I would \nappreciate that. And then we can get going. Hi everybody. I'm Andrew Weiner. I'm a giant \ncompliance nerd in the world of crypto. I've   been in the industry for about 10 years. I've studied under some of the masters of the   industry like Andreas Antonopoulos, Greg Penn, the \nformer director of Thompson Reuters World Check,   and some of the innovative minds behind iComply \nKYC. They were the delegates from Canada that   helped write this giant piece of legislation \nwe all know as the Travel Rule. So that's my   background. And these days, I'm the Chief \nOperating Officer of WEEX.com, which is a   centralized cryptocurrency exchange boasting over \n1,700 pairs and nearly 10 million users worldwide   trading on that thing every day. So, thank \nyou. I'm so happy to be on the show, brother. So, the biggest thing that we've been talking \nabout is I asked you, I think we met in Monaco   when we started really deep diving into this \nand I said what would be your major tokens that   you would be holding and why? And so you took me \ndown the rabbit hole of this entire thing and how   tokenization is going to take over at a hundred \ntrillion dollars coming. And these are the things   that I think everybody kind of understands and \nknows and sees, but at the same time we just don't   really position ourselves. We don't really believe \nit. We know it's coming but we don't know how. So   take me down the rabbit hole again. Let's start \nwith I don't want to go into the ETH, Solana,   you know, all that rabbit hole, but I want you to \nexplain to me when you say that hundred trillion   dollars coming on-chain, why is that, how you \nposition, and what the whole thesis is behind it? Absolutely. And thank you so much for giving me \nthe platform to bring this education to the market   because I find that this particular subject is \nlike the most mystified of all the things that   people talk about when they're looking at Alt \nSeason and they're trying to figure out where   is that next inflection point for the cycle. And what everybody seems to get wrong is they   don't understand that all of these financial \nproducts and services require a backbone. A   backbone like capital markets has. And in capital \nmarkets, a backbone would be something like the   Depository Trust Clearing Corporation. This \nis a quadrillion dollar plus settlement desk,   clearing desk. And why is that important? Well, if we think back to GameStop, which was   like a financial revolution in and of itself, \nGameStop and what was happening on Robinhood,   you know, all those orders, where are they \nflowing through? Who's the market maker? Who's the actual desk paying people out \non something that's gained so much value   and liquidity? And that would be a clearing \ndesk, Depository Trust Clearing Corporation. Now in crypto, the money that \npeople are bringing to the system,   it's thin."

Who's the market maker? Who's the actual desk paying people out on something that's gained so much value and liquidity? And that would be a clearing desk, Depository Trust Clearing Corporation. Now in crypto, the money that people are bringing to the system, it's thin. It's not like a giant institution \nwith hundreds of trillions of dollars behind   it there to make sure that the price that \nyou're trying to get is going to be there   for you in a second from now because \nthat's how volatile crypto is right now. Every second prices are swinging and within a \nminute it could be drastically different than   the position you were trying to take just one \nminute ago. But in traditional capital markets   money moves a lot slower. These types of \ninstitutions are stacking up orders and   settling them slowly in like two to three business \ndays. And they ensure that there's more liquidity   behind every asset at all times giving you a \nlot more assurance and insurance on the flow. But you know in our ecosystem, if we just use \nlike a token that did a big airdrop as an example,   a lot of the people that get that airdrop, \nthey might be coming to our ecosystem with   like zero of fiat. They may be coming in \nthrough the airdrop only, that was their   onboarding into crypto. And then they sell \nthat token, they get real fiat for it or USDT,   a stable of some kind. They go back into the \nmarket, they start trading leverage. So even   more money that they don't have is now being put \nagainst their positions. And when you scale that   by millions and millions and millions of market \nparticipants around the globe, you get real thin   liquidity situations pretty quickly. There's so \nmany people that came to crypto with no money,   brought value, but didn't bring money and may \nor may not have taken money out of that system. So this is like one of the mechanisms of \ncrypto that makes it pretty unstable is   the fact that we don't have this like giant \nliquid infrastructure that's always ensuring   the stability in the market and that settlements \nacross every platform are equivalent. Let's use another great example of crypto. I think Cronos is a good case study in the   point I'm trying to make here. Cronos shot up \nto 38 cents on the Trump announcement. We all   saw that in the market. What a crazy run. For \nanybody who doesn't know, Cronos is the token   of Crypto.com. So, that's their native token and \nthe Trump Foundation's announcement, you know,   we saw the market reaction. It went to like \n38 cents, but then all these futures markets   across all these platforms with no liquidity for \nCronos opened up and all these people started to   trade against these futures markets. So if you're \nnow bringing in a bunch of people that haven't   contributed to this TVL, to any of the liquidity, \nare now taking from it en masse on leverage,   of course you get instability. There's a couple \nmore case studies and examples of this but I want   to pause there so you can get back to the \naudience here with the point we just made. Look, I think for me the biggest thing \nthat people, what was striking me from   this whole thing, it's obvious that when \nyou look at the biggest argument, you know,   we meet people every day. We talk to hundreds and \nhundreds of people every month that are getting   into crypto and the biggest argument everybody \nmakes is exactly this, that I'm not investing in   a volatile risky thing like this. And then I say, \nokay, but have you seen the Amazon stock in 2000? Like have you seen that one which is one of the \nbiggest companies on the planet now? And so we   are very early in the industry but still being \nin 14, 15 years people don't understand where   would liquidity come from and how will regulation \nactually help with liquidity. So that was the next   step that I think we should really talk about."

And then I say, okay, but have you seen the Amazon stock in 2000? Like have you seen that one which is one of the biggest companies on the planet now? And so we are very early in the industry but still being in 14, 15 years people don't understand where would liquidity come from and how will regulation actually help with liquidity. So that was the next step that I think we should really talk about. You mentioned the DTCC and how the regulation   is going to change and can it change to the extent \nthat these tokens, and now we have like 50 million   tokens to the four trillion market cap whereas \nyes we had 700 billion market cap in 2021 but   we had maybe 20,000 tokens. So how does that \nwhole thing unfold and what's the next step? So, what they've accomplished, and this is pretty \nimpressive, is they've satisfied a pilot to prove   that you can bring markets on-chain and you can \nstill keep control of all the security and risk   assurances and compliance that's expected \nof you as not only an issuer, but also as a   broker-dealer, an exempt market dealer, and all \nthe other services that come together to give   people access at scale to these types of financial \nproducts. And that's super exciting because,   you know, this is like a 10-year journey. Security \ntokens kind of came onto the scene back in almost   2016. And here we are in 2026 coming up on the \nhorizon and this press release now with DTCC and   the Canton Network where they're going to get \na three-year pilot to tokenize some of the 100   trillion dollars of RWA that they manage there \non Wall Street. And that's just one desk in one   jurisdiction. Now, if that's successful and we \nsee the beauty of a framework that comes out of   that that's now turnkey for any issuer, anybody \nthat wants to IPO, anybody that wants to take   their metals, their securities under reserve \nor under management on-chain, to deliver more   efficient and effective access and scalable access \nto being able to buy and sell and participate in   those marketplaces, that's when we see crypto go \nfrom 3% global adoption of just like the OGs and   some institutions in it to maybe 40 to 50% of all \navailable financial participants. That's wild. Here is where my question really comes in and I \nthink this is the one of the biggest things that   people wonder about. What happens? Fine. We do \nhave, I 100% agree with you. Tokenization is the   way forward. Blockchain is the way forward. I think it's not a question anymore really. They're going to run these pilots, whatnot. But one of the major questions is does that   mean that AVAX has utility here? Does that \nmean that Monad has utility? Does that mean   that Sonic has utility? I'm just naming three, \nbut I could have named a hundred others or a   thousand others. That doesn't really mean that \nthe tokens that we know today are the ones that   we invest for the future and hold them. How \ndoes tokenizing the S&P pump my altcoin bags? Well, so here's the thing. How is AI going to \nchange the market yet? How many projects and   memecoins went to market with no utility, no use \ncase, nothing but hype and community? Suddenly   like, oh, this is something I could build towards. This is a way to take what we've established as an   ecosystem and add to our tokenomics to now either \nbridge or fork or whatever to be a part of this. I think of Telegram and the TON Foundation \nas like another one of these great case   studies where how many projects had \npivoted over so they could build into   the TON app and then get turnkey access to \na pent-up demand of consumers. So I do... But if you look at these charts they're down, \nthey're dead. It's not into the future. We're   talking about six to 12 months. I mean crypto \nwas $15,000 at less than two years ago. So, you know, if we look at the actual all-time \nlows and highs of each year, just go back to 12   months, 12 months, 12 months at 90K. Holy \nsmokes we're nowhere close to what it was."

So, you know, if we look at the actual all-time lows and highs of each year, just go back to 12 months, 12 months, 12 months at 90K. Holy smokes we're nowhere close to what it was. So if there's still all that room, yeah, I still \ndo believe that there's plenty of potential out   there in the developers, coders, builders, \nand the ecosystems that they have to mobilize   their audience and mobilize their teams towards \ncapturing that medium when it becomes available   because right now it's not available. Like look, \nthe US right now is talking about opening up the   banking system. So any crypto company without \nsome long process and approval can build a   product with their APIs and plug into financial \nmarkets and then deliver a service through what   their chain is and their apps are, whether \nit's a wallet, whether it's an app,   whatever. This is already real in Brazil where \nthey have the open banking API. There's so many   jurisdictions where there are good models and \ncase studies that once we get them in the two   biggest markets in the world, which is North \nAmerica and parts of Asia, that's what I think   kind of that inflection point is. Look, we have \n3% adoption in crypto. So many of that 3% came to   the system with no cash. They contributed no money \nto the system. They came in on an airdrop. They've   been participating in the system on leverage in a \nlot of cases. That type of market participant is   not how people are going to get onboarded for \nthe next 97% of adoption. The types of market   participants that are coming in are coming in with \nhundreds of millions of dollars. And that I think   is what the difference is. The type of consumer \nin the audience changes in the next three years. The question is where does that money \ngo? Because I agree with you and I   think adoption is probably in my opinion a \nlittle bit higher but I 100% agree with 80%,   90% of these people came in with no money or very \nlittle money especially looking at the last years   looking at all the Telegram games exactly as you \nmentioned looking at all the meme coins looking   at all the airdrops looking at everything that \nyou could just farm. But where does that hundreds   of billions of dollars go into if it doesn't go \ninto ETF? First of all why would it even go into   ETF tokens other than Bitcoin, ETH? Maybe some \nselected Solana, maybe some selected others. Like,   why would anybody buy Doge in an ETF or \nCardano in an ETF? You know what I mean? Well, that's the only vehicle that's available \nto the consumer right now. Technically. But   that doesn't mean they will buy it. It doesn't \nmean it makes sense for hundreds of billions   of dollars to go in and buy it. My question is \nwhere does that money ripple down? Where does   that hundred billion dollars go in? And how do I \nposition myself today for that? Because and just   something again I'm not as knowledgeable in \nthe whole tokenization most likely as you are   not as close to the fire either but if I look at \nthis what makes sense to me is that any of these   companies have to create their own chains whether \nthat's a Layer 2, whether that's a Layer 1,   whether it's an open chain whether it's a closed \nchain they have to create it for security purposes   for compliance purposes and once that's done \nthey're going to open it up for participants   to connect to bridge to whatever to those \nchains. That means that all the 100 plus   Layer 2s become basically obsolete. If this is \nthe trajectory that we're looking at, why not? So right now if we use the internet and Web 2 as \na great example and when we switch to like HTML 5,   how many people just had to build towards the \nnext medium and pivot right and still access   the consumer this way?"

So right now if we use the internet and Web 2 as a great example and when we switch to like HTML 5, how many people just had to build towards the next medium and pivot right and still access the consumer this way? I mean even early in the \ninternet when people are like why would I buy   pins and needles on the internet? Why would I buy \nbuttons? Why would I get my printing? Why would I,   you know, why would these types of business be \non the internet? It's technology, right? No,   this is a weird way to think. It's a new vehicle. And that vehicle, how people innovate to plug into   it and make monetization on their existing tech \nwithout too much reiteration on what they've   already developed and delivered to the audience. I see that as a true concept, a true option,   especially if you built on something like Ethereum \nwhere you have a foundation that certainly isn't   going away anytime in the future. This is my \nbullish use case like right now, and I can't   name one market where I could do this. I can't go \nget access to actual gold markets through a token. Can't do that right now. But that's like the most \nliquid market I could plug into if I was going to   buy an investment today anywhere. So, what about \nwhen we tokenize precious metals and minerals on   something like Canton, on something like Ethereum, \non something like Avalanche? That's the use case   that's not here yet that I think will begin \nthe trickle-down effect because what's going   to happen is somebody like me who might get \nwealthy on like a traditional investment like   telecom or traditional investment like tech, once \nI made a bunch of money and I could play around,   I start investing in things like AI. I start \nplaying around. I might go buy some Doge   tokens. I go kind of take on riskier and riskier \npositions on more eccentric kinds of use cases   with 2% of your capital. You go and do that. But \nwhat happens with the remaining? At least unless   you're really irresponsible, which a lot of \npeople are. We can't apply the logic to the   crypto market that everybody's going to show \nup and act like a responsible investor like   they do in the traditional market because \nno consumers really ever behave like that. Yeah, I agree. So, you mentioned ETH. Let's \ngo down the ETH rabbit hole a little bit   because you've been saying ETH is, you \nknow, the run. Not necessarily make it   into a competition and talk about, you know, \nwe can as well, but rather why ETH? Why ETH? Everybody's burying ETH. ETH is, you know, the \nold generation. ETH is going to zero. Why ETH? Okay. So, I'll use the use case of a merger and \nacquisition as the best tokenization story for   why. In a merger and acquisition today, you have \nto verify every ultimate beneficial owner that's   involved and you have to determine a bunch of \nthe rules around how much somebody can own. So in some jurisdictions it's 10% or less. Some might be 25% or less, could be based on   the exemption you got for using tokenization as a \nvehicle to sell your company. Whatever that looks   like, that process on Ethereum is like a 30-minute \nprocess compared to the real world right now where   it takes like 8 to 12 weeks or longer to do a \nmerger and acquisition in the traditional market. What people discovered is if you take three smart \ncontracts: 20, 772 and a 1404 and you use them   for the crowd sale itself, the minting and the \ntransference. If you use them for the rules,   who can own this token? Where can they own \nthis token? How much can they own this token? And then the actual possible switchable is once \nsomebody has a token, does it move? Can it move   to another wallet? And what conditions under \nwhich can it move? That was proven at a pilot,   that's something that takes like five years."

That was proven at a pilot, that's something that takes like five years. So \nany other medium or chain coming to the table   with an M&A use case right now that hasn't gone \nthrough a half a decade of pain and suffering with   the jurisdictional regulator, they're not going \nto solve this problem before Ethereum already   has. And I think that makes me super bullish \non Ethereum because I know that mergers and   acquisitions cost like $400 billion a year in \nadministrative waste. There's so much rubbish   that goes into two companies buying and selling to \neach other. And then all the directors, officers,   stakeholders, and ultimate beneficial owners \ncoming to the table to sign off on that. You know,   with a blockchain like Ethereum and the smart \ncontracts, the way they layer them with ZK,   we can like secure the identity and information \nof the directors, the officers, the stakeholders,   the articles of incorporation, blah blah blah. Try \nnot to get too technical here, but that savings,   that $400 billion dollars of savings of moving \nsomething on-chain is just one application. And insane amount of time as well. Is \nthere any one, what about Solana? You know,   could Solana or any other chain do this? And two, what does this mean for Layer 2s? So Solana can't execute this technology, but it \ndoesn't mean Solana doesn't have a million and   one different types of use cases and case studies \naround it. Because what Solana has proven is you   don't need to be a highly technical person to \nparticipate in cryptocurrency. Is that you can   come to the table, write a contract, get access \nto like the most fervently loyal audience there   is. You know, people that are going to show up \nand take a peek at what you're doing. The some of   the most curious people I've ever met in my life \ngoing to Breakpoint meeting the people that go to   that kind of conference. Why wouldn't you want to \nbuild and plug into that type of community? It's   the same kind of argument for TON Foundation is \nlike why wouldn't I want to be trying to access   the types of people that use Telegram? These are \nthe most tech-savvy types of consumers on the   world that care about their privacy and they're \nlike perfect case studies of what it means to   be a cryptocurrency community participant. I \nthink that's the strength of the Solana chain   and foundation and audience, is that fervent \nbelief and support that you don't really get   in other areas. And forget about crypto for \na second, buddy. Like let's just talk about   traditional finance and what it's like to raise \nmoney. And when I go into a VC's office like I   did 10 years ago and I said, \"Hey, they're \nprobably going to regulate crypto one day. Maybe we should build KYC and AML tools for crypto \nbefore they regulate.\" And how many VCs were like,   get out of my office. What are you talking about? If I had a community like Solana of people that   were a little bit degen, a little bit risky, \na little bit, you know, hey, why not? Maybe   they will do it. This is another argument for \nprediction markets. Like that's another audience   of just really, really helpful people, really \nsupportive people. I don't know the word for   it here, but it's almost cult-like the way they \ncome together to make something real and that   something may have no use case at all. It could be \na memecoin but no utility and it's making people   rich. Like if that's the power of your audience, \nis that not something to be respected and watched? So what does this mean for Layer 2? If Ethereum is \nthe clear winner, what does it mean for Layer 2s? They're only a clear winner in one category."

This \nis again, this is why I say this conversation is   kind of a lot broader than who's the best and \nwho's the worst. Crypto has such versatility. Crypto is agile. Like the Layer 2 of another \nchain right now may not be something that is   being consumed by every single major \ncompany. It has high TVL and lots of   audience right now. Let's say two, three years \nfrom now there's an innovation. There's another   vehicle that they could plug into that makes \nsense that matches their tokenomics utility. I understand what you're saying. My biggest \ntrouble with it is that if it's, if we take   out the casino from crypto, if we say, okay, \nit's not going to be the casino anymore. We're   going to have real companies, real money, real \npeople coming in, building real stuff in the real   world as well, connected, utilizing the blockchain \nand current technology. We don't need 50 million   tokens. Like the prophecy of the alt season \nhappening in the coming whatever is just based   on my understanding is diminishing more and more \nand more. And I know that's not what you think,   but I want to understand why it is not what you \nthink. Why do you think that this actually brings   liquidity to all the different tokens that we \nalready have and hold and love and hope for? Well, I didn't say that people have, \nhold and love 50 million of them. That's, let's make that clarity distinction right \nnow. I believe that there's a place for hundreds   of thousands of different types of tokens and the \ndirect correlation between traditional markets,   real world assets and the hundred trillion \nof inflows I see from that particular sector   propping up a bunch of things that are \nbuilt on and around Ethereum, Solana,   Avalanche, even Cronos and these other types. Yeah but we mentioned four or five. Let's multiply that with 10. We're   looking at 50 tokens, 60 tokens. What \nhappens with all the rest of them? I don't think anybody can predict that. How do you pick the right horse then? Well, it all comes down to what people are \nbuilding and what they're doing because   community right now is a metric for the \nreality of the use cases we have. But I   think the proliferation of the case studies that \nI keep alluding to that are not accessible and   not available to everybody are my catalyst for the \nnext quote-unquote alt season because I think... Let's talk about that. Because I think that's how \npeople also can position themselves. So now we   understand why Ethereum or what. So we just as a \nTLDR, we're looking at a hundred trillion dollars   coming on-chain through tokenization and different \nforms, different categories. Most likely it's   going to be different chains but not all of them. My understanding that we're looking at max 50 to   100 tokens and obviously there will be new and \nnew connections coming up, new projects coming up,   new use cases. We see how prediction markets took \nover the world in three years, two years and every   major outlet quoting them yet it was another \ndegen place to be. Understanding all that,   what's your timeframe and how do you pick the \nright horse or how do you find the right horse? So, I think the timeframe is going to be three \nyears or less. I don't think it's a four-year   cycle. I think the four-year cycle is completely \ndisrupted by the new market participants. I agree. I think the types of money and players at the \ntable now trade differently and that they're   creating metrics and are able to trade at scale in \na way that, you know, the people that started 10   years ago could not and that we've based a lot of \nour data on could not."

Understanding all that, what's your timeframe and how do you pick the right horse or how do you find the right horse? So, I think the timeframe is going to be three years or less. I don't think it's a four-year cycle. I think the four-year cycle is completely disrupted by the new market participants. I agree. I think the types of money and players at the table now trade differently and that they're creating metrics and are able to trade at scale in a way that, you know, the people that started 10 years ago could not and that we've based a lot of our data on could not. You know, a lot of the data   of crypto is based on people that had less than a \nmillion dollars total ever and got very wealthy,   but didn't come to the system with 10, 15, \n25, 100 million already in their back pocket,   ready to deploy, ready to ride out positions \nand margin in ways that nobody ever quantified. This is the new market participant has changed the \ntimeline. So, I think it's three years or less. Now, how do you pick a winner is I would pay \nvery close attention to who's unlocking new   market access. Who is bringing in onramps \nthat are bringing money to the system that   are bringing liquidity and capital to the \nsystem. Not people that are just onboarding   the crypto curious so there's more people \nin crypto and more people trading crypto,   but people that actually bring a financial value \nto the table. And that could be tokenization   vehicles just for accessing securities, but that \ncould also be tokenization vehicles for mergers   and acquisitions, just representing ownership \nof something. These are all different types of   use cases that fall outside of a traditional \nlike ETF model. We're not just bundling things   together and making the new crypto mutual fund. In this next cycle, what we're doing is we're   plugging in to industries, mediums, and verticals \nthat have real cash flow that exceed the entire   market cap of the existing industry of crypto. These verticals we can plug into: real estate,   businesses, golds, precious metals, tech. This is what I think is going to bring the   value. And it's three years or less. So, \njust pay attention to who is unlocking and   plugging into that new market participant. Who's the one that's facilitating, you know,   not airdrop hunters, not bonus hunters, \nbut like real VCs and real investors and   people that want to utilize the medium the \nway that they utilize financial markets. What's your portfolio looking like? What \ncan you share? So like if I was to deploy,   let's say someone is sitting here and he's like, \n\"Holy smokes this makes sense.\" And I'm holding   Shiba Inu and I'm holding you know dog chicken \nfish wing smoking whatever and I kind of want to   and I want to start deploying for the future you \nknow like people will look into the mirror and be   like holy hell what am I doing let's start let's \nstart taking this seriously what are they buying? When I consider my own risk, my own risk \nappetite and what I'm willing to take risk in,   this is my own personal opinion, \nnot financial advice as we all   know. I look at what has the best chance of \nutility in an infrastructure that's going to   see daily use. You know, my brother, he was one of \nthe last private owners ever of Double Bubble gum   before it was swallowed up by Tootsie Roll. And I \nasked him one time of all the companies you could   have bought and all the things you could have \ndone, why'd you buy gum? And he goes, because   you need it every 25 seconds you chew a piece \nof gum, the flavor's gone. You need another one. It reinvents its own demand. And I thought that \nthat was so fascinating. So what in this market,   what use case, what application creates continuous \ndemand and consumption and where has the service   provider positioned themselves to create value \nevery time it's consumed? Now when I look at   what meets that definition, I look at anything \nwith utility on the credit card network. Are you   going to be using this Layer 1 to do settlements \nof credit cards, of interact and debit of these   types of transactions? Somebody's going to get \na fee for that. That fee is going to go into   the ecosystem."

Now when I look at what meets that definition, I look at anything with utility on the credit card network. Are you going to be using this Layer 1 to do settlements of credit cards, of interact and debit of these types of transactions? Somebody's going to get a fee for that. That fee is going to go into the ecosystem. And that's something that gets \nused every day, hundreds of trillions of times   anytime somebody goes to the counter, clicks \ncheckout on the shopping cart. So that's an   excellent definition of what's going to meet \nthe my Bubblegum Test, as I like to call it. Yes, we just invented this \non your stream. You're the... Oh, it's amazing. Amazing. And there's a bunch of different use cases for \nthis. So, settlements. That's number one. Number   two is representing ownership. People will always \nown things. How much do they own? What do they   own? Etc. There's fees taken for that. So, that \ncould be mergers and acquisitions. That could be   all sorts of stuff then. But that's kind \nof the criteria that I'm applying. So,   if you run that through your graph, I'm sure \nit can tell you a bunch of different tokens   right now that meet the Bubblegum Test \nthat are continuously consumed, burned,   recycled. They flow. What won't pass \nthat test are things that are stagnant,   the things that have actually no reason to move. And if there's no movement, then there's no value   being created. It's just a store. So, that's not \nsomething that I'm taking any risk in right now. No Doges. So, what about Bitcoin? How does Bitcoin fit into the oldies? I think Bitcoin is what people are going to be \nselling right now to go do things because Bitcoin   is what has the most value right now and it's the \nthing that's most in demand to people to buy. So,   if I'm somebody in crypto that only has \ncrypto and needs to fund my next 100 ideas,   my next hundred inventions, my next hundred \nprojects, my next 100 whatever, I'm gonna   have to sell that. That's what's going to get \nme money right now. If I sell anything else,   I'm gonna send a domino effect through this \nalready thin liquid market. And that's not what's   going to happen at the top. You're going to see \npeople using Bitcoin for what it was meant to do. It accumulated a crapload of value up to 120K. I \nknow personally from my own sphere of influence, I   know more people that bought at 40K than I do the \npeople that bought in the last, you know, $100,000   of price action. So those people are all building \nright now. They're all trying to make sure that   they beat Wall Street to the table. I mean, \nthere's a real timeline here for when traditional   markets and institutions create private networks, \nmaybe close the gap on some of this hope and take   some more of those 50 million opportunities off \nthe table because they fit that problem solution   fit that so many people have been building for in \nthe beginning. These are things to think about. So when you say three years do you think is \nthere are there any specific points any any   KPIs so to say that you're looking at any \nevents that think you think will influence? I'm talking about regulation. I'm talking it's \nthe press releases related to the Depository   Trust Clearing Corporation and any settlement and \nclearing desk of that size in any market because   there's one in Hong Kong, there's one in MAS. There's so different jurisdictions that have an   institution of that size and scope that if they \nenter the market in a meaningful way and choose a   chain and choose an audience and choose a medium \nfor their products to be a vehicle to get to   market with what they've done. That's something we \nshould be all over. Everybody should be all over. All right. So, how do you see 2026? What \ndo you think about there's I don't know   how much you follow Crypto Twitter but \nthere's like this two main camp right:   four-year cycle it's over, 2026 this is \nrubbish, October we're going to get the   bottom."

What do you think about there's I don't know how much you follow Crypto Twitter but there's like this two main camp right: four-year cycle it's over, 2026 this is rubbish, October we're going to get the bottom. And there's the other side which I'm \nbelonging to which is liquidity is coming,   you can look at so many different catalysts, \n2026 should be in my opinion extremely bullish. And I just want to understand what \nyou think, how you see 2026 happening. I think right now we have a buying opportunity \nup until a major point of inflection out of the   two markets that I mentioned earlier, the North \nAmerican market and the East Asian market and how   it is that they bring that next wave of adoption, \nthat next let's say 1 to 2% of the audience   because those market participants bring the \nliquidity and bring another point of inflection. But up until that moment, until we see that press \nrelease, until I see something that confirms that   those people are at the table now and that they're \nbeing onboarded and that they are participating,   I think it's a buying opportunity. That there was \na buying opportunity like this at the end of 2018,   beginning of 2019. That was, you know, one of \nmy favorite cycles, the end of the ICO and the   primary use case of crypto is gone. How many more \ndid we invent since then? Right? So I think the   2021 as well. So these are the two kind of repeats \nwhere we're seeing it right now 2025. Is this the   last buying opportunity? No. Because I promise you \nin two years from now when a Bitcoin's 150K plus   and it cracks down briefly to 110, people are \ngoing to be like, \"Oh my god, he's dead again. What a crash. We're gonna crash to 100K in a year \nor two from now.\" You wait for that headline. Yes. I agree. I agree. All right. So, rounding \noff soon, if you had to pick three tokens,   I don't know if you're allowed or you can or \nif you had to pick three tokens to hold for   these next three years, knowing what \nyou know now, what would you hold? I would hold WXT first and foremost, the fastest \ngrowing cryptocurrency exchange of the last   12 months, run by one of the most innovative \ncompliance professionals the industry has ever   seen. Shout out in the link below in the video \ndescription. WEEX.com where new wealth is made. By the way, for very important, WEEX is not \nsponsoring this video. I just love Andy and   I thought we're going to make this happen. That I know it looks like it is, but it's not. So, yeah, we're gonna [have] staking yield and all \nthe other things that made every other platform   utility token skyrocket once they did that. So, I think, you know, there's still a bunch   of feature requests that we're delivering on. They're going to make WXT quite a performer,   quite a buy in the next 12 months. I think \nCronos because of their relationship with   the settlement networks and you know how many \nVisa cards have been issued that are directly   tied to Cronos. I think the activation and \nthe use of those Visas as time moves forward   will be quite a catalyst in the \nperformance of that. And Bitcoin,   I think Bitcoin is always a buy. You should \nalways have Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the backbone   of crypto. Bitcoin is the reason we're all here. Bitcoin is the gas that makes the fire burn. Um, it's interesting you didn't say \nEthereum. Why didn't you say Ethereum? Well, because Ethereum is almost three years out. You think you say 12 months? No, no. I said I said for the next three years. For these next three, the major catalyst... Well, the Ethereum and WXT are tied \ntogether. I'm just waiting for that pilot,   man. It's honestly the tokenization use case that \ngets me so excited about Ethereum. And I'm keeping   my eyes on all private networks like Canton, you \nknow, is an honorable mention."

Well, the Ethereum and WXT are tied together. I'm just waiting for that pilot, man. It's honestly the tokenization use case that gets me so excited about Ethereum. And I'm keeping my eyes on all private networks like Canton, you know, is an honorable mention. Anything that has   a pilot ongoing right now that's going to open up \nmore than the market cap of the industry. And man,   can I say something? The market cap \nof our industry is kind of misleading,   too. This is something nobody talks about. It's \n$3 trillion, right? How much Bitcoin has never   moved? How much crypto was lost? How much of \nthat three trillion is actually not available? It's not on it's not linked to anything that \nyou could trade against or buy and receive   value from. It's parked. It's in the cold \nwallets. It's offline so to speak. So what   is the true number? That's something that is \nvery poorly quantified. And again zooms further   in on the fact that it keeps saying that where \nwe're at today is microscopic with the purpose,   the potential and the amount of consumers that \nare not yet at the table. We're talking about   the wrong things a lot of times in crypto that \nwe should just get through onboarding, you know,   the next 50 million people to just buy into crypto \nand be in the system before we really narrow down   like a laser on what's going to happen because \nhow can you tell what's going to happen? Like if   you wanted if you told me that we're going to have \nan election and a million people can vote today,   but next year it's going to be 10 million \npeople can vote and we don't even know who   those next nine million people are and how they \nbehave. I would be really skeptical about your   predictive math and formulas, right? I would \nkind of think that hey, maybe you're just using   a lot of things that are coincidences and trying \nto say that hey, I've discovered the formula. Yeah, this is not science. There's too few people \nnot in at the table yet who could disrupt things. I mean, I remember everybody thought malls would \nnever go away. And then they're like, you know,   why would I buy tea online? Why would I buy my \nclothes online? I can't even try them on. How   many malls are left in your neighborhood? Most \nare gone in mine. I think that that's going to   be true for a lot of ways that we transact. Check cashing stores, remittance, mediums,   a lot of these things are about to get seriously \ndisrupted. So that's my bullish case for crypto. Ethereum, I'm still on the token side. People \nare going to bash me if I don't get this through   you. Ethereum for the next three years. You said \nthey're going hand in hand with WEEX token, right? So that's the two tokens. Okay. What are the \nnext two? What would you if you had to say today   sitting here obviously to Bitcoin? Is that for the \nnext three years as well? But if that's the case   then then I go back again. If that's the case, \nwhy would you not start looking at you can look   at for example again we're just throwing names out \nhere. You can look at the tie in with real world   assets and BlackRock and whatnot. You can look at \ndifferent different you can think about Coinbase   or Base and think about their DEX for example \nAero like like there's so many different... You didn't say pick 10 because those would also \nbe in on that list. You didn't say pick 10,   you said pick three. There's, yeah, you \nmentioned a bunch that if we made this list 10,   we could fill that list. If we made this list 50, \nwe could probably fill that list, too. There's a   lot of things to keep your eye on right now \nand a lot of people should be very bullish. I love it. I love it. Amazing. That's Andy, \nI love talking to you. I think it's always   fun."

I hope that we can catch up soon \nin person as well. Any final thoughts   you have for the community, for the \nshow, anything that you might have? What a privilege it is to even get to \ncome on something like this. I mean,   I can remember last year in December \nhaving a very hairy moment in my hotel   room looking at the market. It was a very \nrough day. I think it was December 18th,   19th or 20th. You did the emergency stream and \nyou were the first person to come online while   I was panicking and feeling terrible and it \nwas really like an angel from heaven like your   tonality and your it touched me in my heart \nthe way you were talking and I'm so happy to   have people like you in the industry to even know \nyou that you're doing like a public service. You   were a real improvement to my mental health \non a tough day. What a wonderful thing that   you've done and continue to do. Because you're \na genuine product user. You are not a person   that can be paid to say something's good. If you \ndon't like something or disagree with something,   you give your real honest opinion every time. And that integrity is thin in a world full of   greed. Um so thank you. That's my parting thought \nis everybody here, make sure you're following 100x   Club, Crypto Banter, my friends, everybody on \nthe channel, Sheldon, Ran, Dylan, Chart Hack,   everybody. I don't want to forget anybody, but I \nlove every single one very much. Kyle, Kyle, Mr.   Dukes, never forget Kyle. And I just appreciate \nthe opportunity to talk to your audience. You've built a wonderful audience of people that \nreally let their voices be heard. Guys, in crypto,   community is the entire backbone of what makes it \nwork. Without a consensus of community, crypto is   obsolete. Crypto doesn't exist. So remember that \nthis industry is bigger than me. It's bigger than   exchanges. It's bigger than projects. It's you. It's in your heart. It's in your soul. It's the   reason it works. So keep at it. Whatever you're \nbuilding, build harder. Sometimes prices will be   down. Sometimes your positions are going to get \nwrecked whether you were longing or shorting,   whether you're a bear or bull. It's not a zero-sum \ngame in crypto. You know, it's one v one in a lot   of situations. But if we're working together as \na team and we continue on the mission, which is   delivering secure, reliable access to financial \nservices to people everywhere around the world,   which is the mission of cryptocurrency, I \nthink we're in a very good place. I mean,   I got rich from it, but as long as people have \ntheir lives improved in some way, shape, or form,   I think that's a job well done. And cheers to all \nof you. Check us out at WEEX official. WEEX.com. We got to book your link in the description. Brother, I appreciate you being here. Truly do. And I hope to catch up with you. Maybe every six \nmonths we should do this. We can just come back   and check in with the list, check in with each \nother. I appreciate you a lot. Check out Andy   down in the description. We're going to get you \nlink in and I'll see you in the next one, brother. And that is it, guys. If you have enjoyed \nthis, let me know in the comment section.
