      "text": "Yo, welcome everyone. Bitcoin is now forming a big descending triangle, but the breakout will probably fail. Be slightly more careful in the coming days. And let me show you why. Now, first you're also going to see our levels on Bitcoin have been respected almost exactly. Remember in our yesterday's video, we talked about our golden Fibonacci ratio when we are measuring the entire push down. Bitcoin hit our gold pocket almost to the exact dollar accuracy. We also took the liquidity exactly above our recent high and of course also we hit a significant trend line area of resistance making it literally from the alltime high. All of those three levels were hit beautifully and Bitcoin exactly from this specific area is right now getting a rejection back down of approximately 2.7%. Of course, in yesterday's video, I also gave you a very nice, very simple trading idea. We can be looking for a short trade at our area of resistance, stop-loss exactly above the high, taking the profits along the way. And yes, at the moment, it really does look like this specific trade is playing out beautifully. Even myself exactly right here at this specific level, I added even more capital to my short trade on Bitcoin. So, my average entry price right now is approximately $90,000. Yes, at least for now, I do remain also in my long trade on Bitcoin and also in a long trade on XRP. However, in today's video, I'm going to share with you exactly one of the very important levels where potentially I'm then going to close my long trade on Bitcoin and also on XRP and I'm only going to hold the Bitcoin short trade because potentially we might be looking for a bigger push towards. But right now, first of all, also the most people of course really like to trade patterns. They right now probably are paying attention to quite a significant descending triangle on the 4hour time frame. Remember a descending triangle unfortunately does have a higher probability of breaking towards downside. It is definitely more of a bearish than bullish pattern. However, also when we are zooming in let's just say on the 1 hour time frame one might even say bro it's not going to be a descending triangle. Clearly Bitcoin right now for the past few days it is forming right here brand new lower highs while we are also getting brand new higher lows. So it could also be some kind of a symmetrical triangle. Now to be honest and of course as you also probably know I really do not like trading breakouts or maybe even any breakdowns. I simply like to simplify everything and to go with a long trade at the area of support and a potential short trade at the area of resistance. Doesn't really matter if we have a symmetrical triangle right here or maybe if Bitcoin does have right now a significant descending triangle. The"

I simply like to simplify everything and to go with a long trade at the area of support and a potential short trade at the area of resistance. Doesn't really matter if we have a symmetrical triangle right here or maybe if Bitcoin does have right now a significant descending triangle. The most important thing is at the areas of support on a discount on the push down, we are more interested to fire a brand new long trade because of course the main strategy is always going to be trying to buy low and sell high. So to be honest right now for all people that are right now looking at this specific descending triangle or maybe even a symmetrical triangle I personally do not really care if we do get right push down start breaking a level that I'm going to show you slightly later definitely a bearish Bitcoin indication and in this specific scenario a major descending triangle could potentially get a bigger breakdown towards the downside and what is going to be the technical target of the triangle right here we are going to be measuring the entire opening of the triangle and putting the trend line on the potential breakdown that might even happen in the coming days. And you're right, I'm going to see the technical target is going to be at approximately $75,000 US area, which actually it is going to align very very nicely also with our recent low. But of course, if we are going to go that low, probably Bitcoin is then also going to take the liquidity below our recent low and only then potentially do get some kind of a bigger bounce back towards the upside. That is also right why I would really appreciate for you to smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible and of course also thank you for subscribing to the channel right now. Let's also talk about why this specific area is definitely going to be a very important price target because also remember from our yesterday's video we talked about a bigger fivewave price structure towards downside on the daily time frame. However, what if we are right now zooming in slightly more, let's just say on the 2-hourly or maybe even on the 1 hour time frame, don't really care about the descending triangle and we need to measure some very important Fibonacci extension price target. So, what we are rightly going to say, okay, if Bitcoin is right looking slightly more bearish, if our important support level in the next couple of days is going to see a breakdown, we can then definitely talk about our fivewave price"

So, what we are rightly going to say, okay, if Bitcoin is right looking slightly more bearish, if our important support level in the next couple of days is going to see a breakdown, we can then definitely talk about our fivewave price structure towards the downside also on the 1 hourly. what we are going to say. Okay, Bitcoin got the first impulse right here. Right now, potentially we have already completed our second Ali wave right here. Or if we are going to get another push up, we are also then going to extend our second Ali wave. And more about that slightly later. But right now, let's just say Bitcoin completed the second Ali wave right here and potentially in the next few days. And of course at the start of the brand new year we might be expecting a bigger push down for our third fourth and then of course also the fifth Elliot wave. What is going to be the technical target of our third Elliot wave when we pay attention to the fivewave price structure on the 1 hour time frame. So what we are right now going to do let's go with our trendbased Fibonacci extension from the exact high back towards the exact low back towards the exact high. And we need to pay attention only to one very important price target which is going to be 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. And you can rightly see the target doesn't perfectly align with the price target of our descending triangle. However, it is coming in very very close. $74,000 is going to be the technical target of the third Alli wave. And yes, if we are going right now with the logithmic scale, the target is actually going to be exactly the same, $75,200 area, if Bitcoin is right now actually going to continue much lower and actually going to get a major breakdown out of our descending triangle. However, here I would also say that you need to pay attention to the potential second Ali right here extending slightly higher. And what exactly do I have in mind? Remember in the past few videos we have been talking about a major trend line area of resistance that we are literally making it from the alltime high almost exactly from 125,000 US and what you can potentially see right here Bitcoin if we get another push toward the upside of course technically speaking it is going to be breaking our major trend line right here.

However, I personally really do not like trading breakouts. I much rather go with a short or a sell position at the area of resistance and a long trade at the area of support. If right the Bitcoin is going to start breaking our trend line area of resistance towards the upside. Guess what majority of people are going to be doing at this specific area. They are going to think okay the level is getting a break up. Let's go with a brand new long trade. However, I would say like that because if we are then going to get another bigger push towards the upside right here a major area of resistance is going to get hit. What exactly you need to pay attention to right here? A major golden Fibonacci ratio when we go from our high back towards the low is definitely going to get hit. If we start going higher, then of course our second Allen wave right here could potentially extend. We are going to get some kind of an ABC correction right here. And of course, if we do get some kind of a reaction at this specific area, yes, I might be looking to go with another short trade not only on Bitcoin, but of course also potentially on Ethereum and also on XRP. Definitely the strategy for Bitcoin is actually staying exactly the same. We are more bearish at the area of resistance. We are being more bullish at the area of support. And what is right or going to be another very important level? You should really pay attention to right now. Of course, you know this specific level is the most important level if Bitcoin is going to be able to get a push up. However, what if we start going lower and Bitcoin is already going to start forming the third Ali wave. In this specific scenario, there are only two important volume levels you should be paying attention to. Measuring right now the entire bottom price action with the volume. You're going to notice the value area low is going to come in at $85,700. Also, what we can do right here measuring only this specific part of the price action where the value area low is going to be at $86,600. If this specific zone of support on Bitcoin does get a breakdown, in my opinion, we are potentially already looking for the bigger push down of the third Alli wave, then of course also the fourth"

If this specific zone of support on Bitcoin does get a breakdown, in my opinion, we are potentially already looking for the bigger push down of the third Alli wave, then of course also the fourth one. And then of course also the fifth one for us to finish the bigger fivewave price structure, not only on the 1 hourly and two-hourly time frame, but of course also on the daily time frame, finishing the bigger fivewave price structure. And of course, the lower we are going to go, the bigger long trades I'm going to deploy on Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and pretty much on the entire cryptocurrency market. But of course, also my trading bots are actually going to be buying the DEP. They are not going to be scared if Bitcoin does get another push down. It is very important when you're actually starting those specific bots. And usually, it is the best once Bitcoin is getting a push down. Right now, of course, we have already gotten a push down. In my opinion, right now is actually a very good time for you to maybe even start using the Bitcoin and also the Ethereum trading bot. So, you can very simply sign up on Pionex using this specific link down below in the description. After you register and after initial deposit, you're going to get a beautiful bonus and then simply deploy my exact bots with this specific link down below in the description. You're going to copy the exact same settings I'm using right here. And definitely if Bitcoin does go down towards 75, maybe even 70, maybe even $65,000 area, the Bitcoin bot is going to be buying the dip. Also, the Ethereum bot is going to be buying the dip. And of course, on the way up, it is going to be taking the profit for you. Also, right now, pay attention to the CVD indicator to the yellow line on the 30-minut time frame. This specific indicator is showing to us if the buying or selling pressure is coming in the market. So you're right now going to see a brand new higher high is being formed on the CBD while Bitcoin is forming a brand new lower high. So what does that exactly mean? Buying pressure is coming in the market but it's not really able to push the price higher. This right here is a bearish indication of Bitcoin. Bearish divergence, bearish absorption. So that is why potentially in the next few hours we might be looking for another very slight push towards the downside on the"

So that is why potentially in the next few hours we might be looking for another very slight push towards the downside on the Bitcoin price itself. Potentially for us to take the liquidity below our recent low. Of course, then we are going to see how our volume area of support right here is going to be able to hold. If not, the next target is the lower volume level. But of course, also if this one is going to be lost, we definitely should make sure that we are then expecting much lower targets in the next few days. Also, right now, pay attention to our Bitcoin liquidation heat map. First of all, on the twoe time frame, this specific chart is right on definitely being slightly more bullish. Bitcoin does have bigger liquidations exactly above the recent highs because if we do get right push towards the upside over 261 million of short trades are going to get liquidated. So this right here this specific level is acting as a magnet for Bitcoin. However, what if we are right now zooming in let's just say on the onee time frame to see if our bigger liquidations are below the lows or above the highs. And here we are going to see a completely different story. Bigger liquidations on the oneweek time frame are not going to be above our recent highs, but actually exactly below the recent lows. Approximately 130 million of long trades are going to get wrecked if Bitcoin does get another push down below our recent low. So this right here locally is a bearish indication. The bearish absorption we are getting right here is also locally speaking more of a bearish than a bullish indication. So definitely in the next couple of hours potentially Bitcoin might even get another push down for us to test our volume level and then of course we are going to go from there. Please note that yes unfortunately we are still right now trading in a major downtrend looking right now on the 1 hourly time frame. Clearly you are going to notice that our 200 exponential moving average the green one is above the 50. So it really means we are in an average downtrend on the 1 hourly on the 2hourly and also on the 4hour time frame. being right here, super bullish on Bitcoin, in my opinion, does not really make a lot of sense. Yes, of course, we can get slightly more bullish if our bigger trend"

So definitely right now Bitcoin is really at a decision point. Are we going to get a push down? Are our volume support levels going to get broken? Are we actually looking for much lower targets or simply are our areas of resistances going to be able to get a major breakout back towards the upside? That is why of course I'm using my Bitcoin and Ethereum trading bots right here that are actually buying the dip and are taking the profits for me.
