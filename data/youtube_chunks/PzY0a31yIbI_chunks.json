      "text": "The world now places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next. >> This is it. It's happening. Finally, Bitcoin dips below 90,000. 200 million liquidated from crypto markets in 60 minutes. Prepare for a bounce. Prepare for a bounce. Why do I say this? Well, while at the same time we're seeing fundamental metrics at all-time highs across the board, stable coins, tokenized funds, tokenized commodities, tokenized stocks, Black Rockck CEO Larry Frink just sent a chilling warning to the other global elites at the World Economic Forum Davos today. >> The world now places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next. If the World Economic Forum is going to be useful going forward, it has to regain that trust. >> This is at the same time that the general public is gaining trust in crypto. Large institutions, corporations, public companies, and entities like Michael Sailor's strategy continue to buy. Michael Sailor announcing today acquiring another 22,000 Bitcoin for 2.13 billion at about 95,000 per Bitcoin. Currently, they hold just over 7,000 Bitcoin. Now, worth 53.92 billion. >> The industry is going to 10x. It's going to increase by a factor of of 10 based upon activities that are taking place at JP Morgan, at Wells Fargo, at Bank of America, at Morgan Stanley, you know, at BNY Melon. It's the big household brands at City, right? They're the ones that are going to introduce uh Bitcoin and digital assets to the next billion people. >> Big entities institutions Wall Street continues to either onboard to Ethereum or buy Ethereum directly. Tom leaves Bitmine announcing they're 74% of the way there to their goal of 5% of the Ethereum supply. They continue to buy. >> Ethereum to me is the new Wall Street. You know, in 1971 the dollar went off the gold standard. Okay. Now, everyone thought in 1971 the play was gold, but actually in 1971 the dollar became synthetic. It no longer was backed by anything. And that's when Wall Street stepped in and said, \"Okay, we got to make sure that the euro or well, the German frank or whatever German mark or the French Frank doesn't become dominant.\" So, Wall Street built products to make sure everyone used a synthetic dollar. Wall Street was the big play in 1971. In 2025, we're making everything synthetic. We're starting with tokenizing the dollar and then, as you know, Wall Street's going to tokenize equities and everything I just listed. Massive opportunity. Ethereum is in a super cycle because of that. It's not a surprise to me to hear 7 trillion UBS bank CEO announce that crypto in his opinion is the future of banking and finance. You know that wirehouses like UBS just started solicited sales of Bitcoin and Ethereum and crypto. Finally, their representatives can reach out to their clients and say, \"Hey, you should buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin should be part of your portfolio.\" I do believe that blockchain and that kind of technology is the future for the traditional banking business. So you will see a convergence of that but you know we need to uh pay attention in in making sure that at the end of the day banks are uh you know uh uh leave out of trust and people want to put their assets and their you know whatever assets they have in a trusted place. In fact, Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's CEO, had to set the record straight today on CNBC Squawkbox. They asked him, \"Hey, isn't the New York Stock Exchange tokenizing stocks bad for you, bad for crypto companies, Brian Armstrong says, not only is this good for us, the crypto user, the crypto holder benefits the greatest.\" >> New York Stock Exchange uh just announced yesterday a new platform that I imagine will compete with you to some degree, a new tokenized platform. Everybody seems to be introducing all sorts of programs that frankly look a lot like things that Coinbase does. And I wonder just what you think the whole industry looks like, you know, a year or two or three from now in terms of what you're doing relative to what everyone's doing. And by the way, at the same time that you're trying to get into everybody else's business. >> Yeah. Well, I mean, I was thrilled to see that. I think New York Stock Exchange announcing their interest in tokenized equities is just one more data point of crypto is updating the financial system and we want everyone to be able to do that and make make our capital markets more efficient. Does it take the moat away from everybody's business? If if everybody can do the same thing, >> what happens in the end?"

Does it take the moat away from everybody's business? If if everybody can do the same thing, >> what happens in the end? >> Um, customers win with competition. [laughter] I mean, we we shouldn't have policies being created in the United States that um favor one set of companies over another. There should be clear rules of what's allowed, what's not, and then everyone competes. That's how the customer benefits. >> We are hitting major support right now. I'm expecting a big bounce. Maybe not the second, but watch for the bounce. The number one issue holding up the crypto market is still the crypto market structure bill clarity act. As the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, himself states, this is the one thing keeping crypto from moving forward. But he is confident a good version of this can pass in 2026. Listen to his reason why. >> I think what we have to realize here is that crypto can provide solutions uh like rewards and stable coins. It can also build lending products like DeFi lending is growing enormously. >> Top three issues right now for you that that were problematic in that bill. >> Yeah. So the number one is really around payment of rewards on stable coins. I think Americans should be able to earn more money on their money. Uh banks should have to compete on a level playing field and if the American people feel like the banks are not paying high enough interest rates and stablecoin rewards can offer them more then maybe the banks should have to pay higher interest rates to compete. Right. I don't think there should be any protectionism. >> Do you think that that was put in directly for the banks? that was lobbyed by the banks and put in. >> Yes. And and you and look the banks argue effectively that the stable coin market is going to force massive withdrawals that are going to come out of the banks that it is not an efficient system for credit in America effectively because the treasuries that are going to be required to back the stable coins are not going to be used in the same way. I mean there are arguments uh that I think have some validity from the banking system beyond what you think ultimately happens to the banking system and how much you care about the strength or not of it. >> Yeah. Well, there is certainly a balance of where should this capital go. I mean it can go to lending which is important. It it can also go to buying US treasuries which is also important. And I think that it's essentially going to come down to where can people earn return for the appropriate amount of risk right? Um, if the Fed lowers interest rates, that would push more people to seeking higher returns from a lending product, right? If they raise interest rates, it's going to keep more money at the Fed. And that's frankly what a lot of banks are doing. They're holding trillions of dollars at the Fed also that's not being lent out. And so, I think what we have to realize here is that crypto can provide solutions uh like rewards and stable coins. It can also build lending products like DeFi lending is growing enormously. Um, banks can provide that also. And so, we should have a level playing field where everyone can compete, clear rules, and everyone can win. Should you have a level regulatory framework as well? Should you be regulated the very same way the banks are if that's the the plan? >> And here the Coinbase CEO really slams banks just exposed the bank scam live on CNBC in Davos saying banks are lending customers deposits without their permission. This is wild. >> Well, the banks are doing something very different which is called, you know, fractional reserve lending. So, they're actually lending out customer deposits without their permission essentially, right?"

So, under Genius, um, stable coin issuers have to hold 100% reserve. It's not fraction reserve. 100% of the assets are in short-term US treasuries. It's very low risk. It's less risky lending would be coming from what money? >> Um, that's customers opting in into it and they can say, \"All right, I actually want to earn more. So, I'm going to put my money into this DeFi protocol and I can get six or seven or 10% return for some appropriate amount of risk. So, it's customers opting into it as opposed to banks doing it behind the scenes. >> I don't know if you had an opportunity in our green room is Brian Moahan who's coming on right after. Oh, yeah. Did you guys have an opportunity to talk? Have you been talking to a lot of the bank leaders here about this very issue because I assume he has some uh >> pretty, you know, provocative things to say. >> I had to separate those two. It was uh >> you had to separate, >> wasn't it? in Brian played rugby uh in Colorado. Maybe >> good thing David Beckham's in there >> and David back there. >> You got an all-star cast in there. But no, actually um I have been here meeting with bank CEOs. That's one of the main things I'm doing is trying to figure out, okay, what would get them to a Yes. I I do believe there's a win-win outcome. I mean, by the way, Coinbase is actually providing crypto infrastructure services to five of the top 20 banks in the world. And so we we're talking with the commercial sides of these banks and they see it as an opportunity. Their lobbying arms and their trade groups are coming in and trying to ban their competition. And so to me, you shouldn't be able to ban comments. >> My name is Aaron at Altcoin Daily. Make sure you subscribe and for information and opinions by the second, make sure you follow us on X.
