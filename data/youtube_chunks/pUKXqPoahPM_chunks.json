      "text": "Everyone is waiting for the Fed to say the magic words. Those words that have traditionally sent your bags absolutely ripping. QE is here. >> Quantitative easing. >> Quantitative easing. >> Quantitative easing. >> Quantitative easing. >> Money printing. Pivot. Stimulus. But if you're waiting for the Fed to announce it as they have before, you're watching the movie in a foreign language. Today's guest is Arthur Hayes. He co-founded BitMX, the OG crypto leverage platform. Before crypto, he traded at Cityroup and Deutsch Bank and has been mastering the macro landscape. You're going to want to watch this with a magnifying glass and taking notes. He says, \"You are waiting for a headline that is not coming.\" >> So, everyone knows that quantitative easing equals money printing equals inflation. So, it can't be quite There's no more QE. QE doesn't exist anymore. It will never happen again. The Fed will never call increasing its balance sheet quantitative eating ever again because >> so if they never call it QE again what are they protecting? Arthur goes straight for the incentive structure and behind the entire system. >> The US economy is a financialized economy. The stock market is the US economy and so the you know end of the day the authorities have to do whatever is necessary to make sure the stock market goes up. That might sound like a Wall Street problem until it changes what you can put on the table for food and for your family. >> However, in real money in in real terms, i.e. how many how much steak can you buy? How many eggs can you buy? >> Yeah. >> How many times can you fill up your car? There's real risk there. That real value of a treasury bill or a treasury bond or note fluctuates a lot and to the downside over time. And then once a macro framework is set, Arthur pivots to one question every crypto investor actually cares about where is the asymmetric opportunity. >> So if you take away, you know, Bitcoin, which is obviously the largest thing that we hold in our portfolio, our best performing position of this part of the cycle was being long Athena. Um we got in very very early uh cuz we were the founding adviser of that project. And next year the team is going to try we need to find another Athena that was that made our portfolio for the last 2 years. What's the next thing? I think the next thing is So stay locked in guys because by the end of this conversation you will understand how liquidity can hit your bags without a single QE headline. And for most who aren't aware of this exclusive alpha you're getting today, they will realize when it's too late. And we'll hear about where Arthur is looking for the next big opportunity in crypto. This is juicy. You definitely want to watch the end. And again, remember, nothing"

This is juicy. You definitely want to watch the end. And again, remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. Without further ado, let's get into it and bring Arthur to the stage. Arthur, welcome back to the show, man. It's good to have you here. There's a lot of people out there who are confused as hell right now, not knowing which direction to go. And uh I think generally uh you and I probably agree on the the general direction forward. And I know that before we started here, you told me that you have some other alpha you want to share here first, which is fantastic. Can't wait to hear that. Uh the immediate thing that's coming right now is the Bank of Japan decision, which when viewers watch this will be, you know, within 12 or 24 hours of that. according to you know prediction markets it's a 98% plus chance that uh you know we get a raise in the rates uh do you think that's likely to happen and um you know what does that what does that mean for our market >> yeah I mean I think Japan the after the speech that UEA gave was a few weeks ago or a week I don't remember the timing and he basically said that the rate hike was on the table and then obviously the the odds rose from what I hear from people who are more knowledgeable at the BOJ basically dollar yen between 155 to 160 is like a no-go zone for the BOJ and so they will um do what's necessary obviously hike rates or possibly green light some sort of FX intervention to prevent the yen from weakening past 160. So right now the Japanese people like everyone around the world is suffering from an affordability crisis. The authorities try to gaslight them and tell them that inflation is not real. They know it's real. Um this impacted the recent elections. Uh the LDP is no longer the dominant party in power which is a big shock. 100% driven by uh affordability crisis within Japan and the weak yen and the new fiscal stimulus package by the new prime minister does nothing to help that. And so you know we were getting close to 160 on dollar yen. And that's why EUA came out and basically green lit a BOJ rate hike. I think the rate hype might go"

And so you know we were getting close to 160 on dollar yen. And that's why EUA came out and basically green lit a BOJ rate hike. I think the rate hype might go from like half a percent to like maybe a quarter of a percent. So in the grand scheme of things with inflation running at the official tally of 3% a year, it's kind of meaningless. It's yes, it's going to tighten the market a bit, but you know, dollar yen was, you know, 100 a few years ago and now we're at 160. Japan is still on sale for anyone who's got dollars or, you know, non-yen uh based currencies. So this isn't really going to change much. Yes, we saw a bit of a riskoff move when the yen reacted to that. Um, with Bitcoin, >> the markets digested that. I kind of think this is kind of a nothing to see here kind of moment. It's just going to go in line with expectations. >> Do you think that that has any uh knock-on risks as far as, you know, serious implications that we should be concerned about >> as far as >> if they really were getting serious about raising rates to where they should be? Yes. But I think this is a a band-aid on a fire hose. The yen's gonna it's still 155 yen as I well looking at my charts right now. Okay, whatever. It's sort of gone down five big figures from 160 to 155. Who cares? Whatever. Yeah, Bitcoin reacted a bit. Um liquidity is a bit tighter in Japan, but again, it's still too easy. >> Yeah. Okay. I mean that Yeah. I mean, this has not been uh hasn't been like we've known this is coming for weeks now already, right? And it just it seems like it's priced in to me. Uh yeah, my big question was the knock-on effects, but uh okay, so there's seems to have been, you know, yeah, there seems to have been that that people were concerned about top of mind right now and then there's also the kind of two cavins who are, you know, have I think both agree on lower rates, but they how they get there is a bit of a different strategy. Uh do you think that this Walsh guy uh imposes a kind of risk on our risk environment? As I always say, the US president gets the monetary policy he desires.

Uh do you think that this Walsh guy uh imposes a kind of risk on our risk environment? As I always say, the US president gets the monetary policy he desires. If you read presidential history from 1913 when the Fed was created until the present, this battle between the president and the Fed chair is nothing new. It's always been acrimonious. It's always been fought nasty in the press. You know, there's there was a a funny anecdotal story that Lynen B. Johnson like physically assaulted his Fed chair and his ranch in Texas to get him to lower rates. Like so all this stuff that like, oh my god, Trump is, you know, being really nasty to J. Paul. Like this is nothing new. >> And again, he's going to put in his own guy. >> It doesn't really matter what they believe before they were Fed chair. They understand that when you're Fed chair, you work for Trump. And Trump wants lower rates. He wants more money supply. He wants to juice markets. And he wants to sort of try to claim with a straight face that he's not sponsoring all this inflation. Otherwise, he's going to get him and his Republicans are going to get voted out of office in in November of next year in 2020 for the presidential election. So again, he'll do whatever he's told. I don't really doesn't really matter who's at the helm. They'll react to the situation as warranted and they will roll out whatever program is needed to get the job done. And so I don't really care who's the Fed chair. >> And how do you think that plays out with uh you know the inflation versus liquidity kind of uh situation? Because you know if we start printing and doing something like we expected with Hasset then we were expecting like very bullish liquidity environments but it's also the more you do that typically the higher rates go or inflation goes and then you still have all these retail who are feeling the pain from that. >> So I guess the game the Fed game and the Treasury game is the US economy is a financialized economy. the stock market is the US economy and so the you know end of the day the authorities have to do whatever is necessary to make sure the stock market goes up and by extension that means the AI mania I know people are starting to question the AI bubble and all this sort of stuff and yes there's been a bit of a correction I think that they're missing out and you know if you're a"

Trump has basically staked the entire US economy on AI being successful and the only way AI is successful if it becomes more debt fueled is to lower the cost of money and increase its supply and he'll do that until he can't. >> And so I think that it's a bit premature to you know start trying to short the NASDAQ or all the you know these Nvidia type companies. These companies are still profitable. They're still spending capex out of cash for the most part. Obviously, there's the odd oracle um out out of the mix, but yeah, I'm not a an AI doomer yet, and the monetary policy needs to make sure this bubble continues because this is essentially the US economy. If you look at, you know, what has been value add to GDP um since, you know, chat GBD kind of burst on the scene and was it 2023 for whatever year it was. >> Yeah. >> So, again, they need to make sure the US stock market goes up. The problem with that is it causes inflation. So then the other side is okay, how do you as a politician stand up with a straight face and say no the policies that I told these people to implement um do not cause inflation and so they change the name of stuff and they make it sound more complicated. So everyone knows that quantitative easing equals money printing equals inflation. So it can't be qu there's no more QE. QE doesn't exist anymore. It will never happen again. The Fed will never call increasing its balance sheet quantitative eating ever again because even the man on the street or the woman on the street knows that they mean inflation. They don't like inflation and they'll vote blue and sort of vote red uh at the next election and that's it. on the on the AI stuff.

I I don't know uh if people understand just how integrated into the the woven fabric of the US economy and growth and GDP and also I think it's been well established by now that they're too big to fail and too critical to fail as a as a national defense architecture. I mean, you've got, you know, everyone working on everything that has to do with I mean, it's not just like the the uh the incumbent companies like OpenAI and Google and stuff like that. It's also where's the power going to come from? And we have a nuclear rising and then we have data centers and we have all this stuff and he just keeps on he keeps on making bills that uh or or executive orders that uh continue to rip off regulatory red tape from AI, which scares the hell out of me. But uh but for as far as the stock market goes, I mean that's just all bullish right there. And none of that can slow down at all for you know this cold arms race against China and things like that. So yeah, that's very Yeah, I I I don't I'm not worried about that either. I think that like uh you just can't you can't let these things stop right now. You got to keep feeding it no matter what it takes. Even if it takes printing money or buying into these things or whatever. So very good point. Uh and yeah the quantity of easy thing I think they just kind of change the name of it every time right and you look back you say that that was easing but uh this time it'll be different. So before we started you had uh you told me that you were kind of working on an essay right now and doesn't you know it's not QE but like Arthur what is it this time? So the new term is rever reserve management purchases and when it first came out I have you know I spent a lot of money on macroeconomic research and so and I paid all of the the writers that I read periodically and I said okay what is is reverse management processes QE or not? And the majority of the, you know, technical monetary market plumbers said, \"No, technically this is not quantitative easing.\" And there's a bunch of reasons why.

You ask, you know, some bond traders, some of my good friends, I'm like, \"Is this QE?\" No, it's not QE. It's something different. Okay. Um, then you get some more of the people who have a little bit more cynical like myself who write macro stuff and you say, \"Is this QE?\" and they say technically no, but yes, it is. It's going to achieve the same purpose. So, I think right now the market as evidenced by Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the most sensitive asset to dollar liquidity issues says no, this is not QE. Uh I don't I don't think that the market properly appreciates what that is. Before I get into why I think it's not QE, if you go back to 2008 and early 2009, um, Fed Chairperson Ben Bernanki comes out with the US's version of quantitative easing. The term quantitative easing comes from Professor Warner when he was talking about the Bank of Japan. I think he coined it sometime in the in the '9s. Um, the quantitative easing, this this balance sheet, um, using the balance sheet to affect asset prices. And again the first time quantitative easing was done was I think the Bank of England back in the when they were bailing out the uh what was the name of the company the one of the companies involved in um trading and colonization back in the 17th century. That was the first time there's quantitative easing. The stock the the proto stock market at the time crashed because people were like, \"Oh no, are they really going to discover all these lands and all this revenue?\" And because it was such a big speculative mania, the Bank of England had to step in and essentially uh print money and buy the stock um to help bail it out. That was the first time we had quantitative easing. So it's nothing new. Again, change the name. We've been changing names for hundreds of years. So right now though, it was quantitative easing. Bmani comes out after the global financial crisis and rolls out this quantitative easing program in November and it the markets didn't know what to make of it. S&P continued to fall. S&P didn't bottom until March of 2009 u when we were well into the wave of QE and Bernanki always stood up and said yes we understand that this is a temporary expansion of the balance sheet and in the near future we will unwind this. Now, by the time he left as chairperson in I forgot what year it was, sometime in the 2010s, uh I"

Now, by the time he left as chairperson in I forgot what year it was, sometime in the 2010s, uh I think they were on the second QE program, the the next chair, um Janet Yellen, you know, growing into her bad girl nature, continued quantitative easing. And it wasn't until uh this you know 2021 when essentially quantitive easing was ended uh by uh JP pow and obviously the market peaked at that point and had a nasty correction after that >> but the point is the market didn't understand what QE was. It didn't believe it was money printing as they understood it. It took a few it took a little while and then everybody's oh yeah this is money printing I love moneying send it. And so I think the similar situation is what's happening today with the you know reserve management program RMP. Uh is it technically QE? No. Because the the Fed is buying Treasury bills instead of mortgage back securities and Treasury notes and bonds and and what they buy in quantitative easing. And if you do the bond math, the modified duration of a Treasury bill is quite low versus the modified duration of a mortgage back security or a 10-year Treasury note. And that has implications about how the banking system replaces those securities with additional loans or bond purchases. Um, obviously a T bill is less impactful than a 10-year Treasury note because the 10-year Treasury note has more interest rate risk embedded in it. So yes, technically speaking, an RMP is not quantitative easing if you assume that the banking system is the one that is going to be the primary channel affected by this program. But it's not. The Fed is doing this to entice money market funds to lend more in the repo markets which directly finance the US Treasury. So it's a way for the Fed to finance the US Treasury at the short end of the Treasury curve directly using money markets funds and the repo market as the the conduit. And and so people say, \"Oh, this is just technically helping the the market plumbing.\" But if Scott Bessant issues most of his debt at the short end and the Fed is buying the debt, that's money printing. It's the same thing. So, you know, that's essentially what I'm arguing.

It's the same thing. So, you know, that's essentially what I'm arguing. And I think that as time goes on, as we have, you know, maybe a few months of seeing the operations, seeing how this money moves through the system, as seeing how the deficit, US federal deficit doesn't decline, how the amount of weekly gross issuance of treasury bills continues to increase, uh how the use of the repo market continues to grow, then people will understand and nope, asset prices will bottom and start to recover. And then people will start to say, \"Oh, no, this is actually QE. The Fed balance sheets going up. the US Treasury is getting funded. This is the mechanism on how it works. Yes, it's a bit different than the QE program that they had previously, but it achieves the same effect. And so that's essentially what I'm arguing. >> What do you think the timeline is for that? And you did say that maybe asset prices bottom for, you know, between here and there. Uh so what does that timeline look like? >> I think we start getting into, you know, a lot more positive um price performance in in January. >> Mhm. Um there'll be a bit of a question about whether the program is going to be durable because at least the official narrative is that this is a temporary program that will last until April. And so I think there's going to be about you know if the market starts to like this R&P and the the weekly addition of liquidity to the markets sometime in March you'll say okay well what's next? Is this going to end? Is it going to continue? And then maybe there's going to be a bit of question around that. And that could be a, you know, a natural time that the market corrects a bit. And then there's obviously, you know, who's going to be the next Fed chair? What's their policy? Are they going to continue this? We'll have a bit of market turmoil. And then they'll reaffirm, yes, we are committed to reserve management purchases. And then it's off to the races. >> How how much uh is is the program started already and how much liquidity is it bringing to the market?

Jon Paul never mentioned anything about reserve management purchases. They hid this in a press release by the um district bank uh of New York City and you know they kind of said oh they released a press release. We're doing this thing called reserve management pro um purchases. Even in the press release, they didn't mention the exact amount that they were repurchasing. They said they released a schedule the next day. It was released and it's about $40 billion, right? So, it's not like Jerome Powell got a threat at the press conference and announced this new program because they know it's money printing and they know they need to hide it. And so, by you know, putting it at a district bank press release, not talking about it in the, you know, the official communicate of the meeting, it's like sort of like, you know, they try to sort of hide it and, you know, downplay it. significance in terms of what they're doing. Whereas, you know, when Ven Bernicki announced QE, it was front and center because again, he was trying to juice financial asset markets after a massive um collapse in prices. >> What do you how are you playing the markets right now? Where yourself personally, where are you uh how you position? Do you are you risk off? You risk on? Are you what are you doing? >> So, we're probably about 90% invested. There's, you know, I have a little bit of cash um sitting around right now, you know, just wearing the volatility. Obviously, we don't use leverage at Maelstrom, so we're not really worried. You know, Bitcoin goes on as breaks 80,000. Okay, whatever. I don't care. I have I have a view. I'm willing to, you know, hold on to that view and and play that out. um what we're really looking for is, you know, what's going to be the next dominant narrative in the in the altcoin space. So, if you take away, you know, Bitcoin, which is obviously the largest thing that we hold in our portfolio, our best performing position of this part of the cycle was being long Athena.

What's the next thing? I think the next thing is something related to privacy, zero knowledge proof, ZK technology, something like that. And I think that is going to hit on a lot of things that people are afraid of, like quantum resistance, you know, AI overloads, AI dean anonymizing data, all that kind of stuff. So, yes, we got a lot of Zcash beta, but I think there's going to be some project doing something related in this space that's really going to blow up and could be the best performing um altcoin of next 2 or 3 years. And I think, you know, 2026 is the time to find that project. I don't know what that is. That's our job as investors. We got to find it. >> Yeah, I agree. Uh I agree. I mean, it's very annoying to have all of your transactions on chain where everyone can see it, right? I mean like it's it's just something that we need and we we kind of deserve is to be able to do I think any type of transactions on chain with having the privacy so people don't look and see what we're doing. I mean that's certain I know for me that's inconvenient. I imagine for you too right people are tracking your wallets everything that you do all the time. >> Well I people don't understand like people see what they want them to see and so if I want you to see it let you see it. If I don't want you to see it you're not going to see it. And so, you know, whenever you see those wallet trackers on uh on X or the social media platforms, take whatever you see with a grain of salt. It may or may not be exactly what I'm doing. And so, um I like transparency and I I like that the there's a blockchain. I can put stuff on chain I want to have on chain. I can trade with other counterparties where you're never going to know what I do. Um, but I think the privacy narrative for at least, you know, Zcash and other ZK type things is, you know, if I actually need to make sure that there's not a government or adversarial company or somebody watching what I do, do I have the way to do that yet or, you know, how do I make sure my data is private um that's going across these digital um highways?"

And and that is the promise of of ZK and whatever else people come up with and why and there's obviously a latent fear about this and you know you want to capitalize on on people's fear.

Can you expand on that a little bit more for audience? Uh I don't I don't know that a lot of the retail is maybe so concerned about uh you know government oversight and the transactions that they're doing or things like that. I mean everyone should be but I just don't think that so is it more for institutions who you think are going to be more using stuff like this or that use case you suggested like who's the user for that? What's the narrative around that do you think? I mean, I think the biggest the easiest thing to talk about would be the Canadian truckers. I forgot what year what that that was. Um, and basically, you know, there were these there's a protest in Canada and people wanted to donate because they politic believed that they were politically lying with these folks and the Trudeau government essentially penalized them by saying, \"Oh, I I see what you're doing there. I don't like your political views. [ __ ] you. Debbank you. >> Yep. >> Put you up in the course. try to take your money um and they could see everything because either it was through the bank system or it was you know um onchain and they're they were able to sort of back things out. So I think that's the that's the real risk for the average ordinary person. You might have a political view um whether that's what are the hot things today, you know, immigration, um reproductive rights, all these sorts of things where you might have a view that differs from whatever you're supposed to believe um wherever you're you're based and you want to contribute to that as, you know, as somebody who's politically uh inclined to do so.

You might have a political view um whether that's what are the hot things today, you know, immigration, um reproductive rights, all these sorts of things where you might have a view that differs from whatever you're supposed to believe um wherever you're you're based and you want to contribute to that as, you know, as somebody who's politically uh inclined to do so. And you know, crypto is a great way to do that. Uh, and what if the government's looking at what you do and they're able because it is pseudonmous um to backtrack worry this money came from penalize you for having the wrong political view whatever that may be. I think this is something that the average ordinary person can get very passionate about and you know Zcash fixes that right shielded transactions you don't know you know I received my Zcash I've shielded it now I can send and receive money and the only person who knows what happened is me >> but doesn't Zcash have the functionality built in where if you know they were get were to get called on by a threeletter agency they would open up those uh those transactions isn't that what >> I mean they have transparent addresses So like that is if you want to use transparent Zcash addresses and I think a lot of exchanges that's the only thing they use yes then those transactions are you know available to see but the shielded transactions that is that that is shielded and the strength of that cryptography increases the large the percentage of the network that is shielded. So that's why you know a lot of influencers on on X and other social media platforms. Do you think that there could be I mean I know obviously it's impossible to like shut it down or ban it entirely or anything like that, but if the government made an effort to try to tell people it was illegal to use something like that, uh it would sure scare a lot of people away from it. Um do you think that's a that's a like a risk of betting on Zcash? >> I think governments have gotten a lot smarter in this age of information age. If you tell somebody they can't do something and you lack, you know, a complete the complete means to affect that decision, people are going to do it anyways and they're going to be more inclined to do it, >> right?

So, people are going to do what they're going to do. And if you tell them they can't do something, they're going to want to do it more. So, they've instead of that, they just lean on the intermediaries. XYZ exchange, you're not allowed to trade this. And so if it's not available in the easy way that people understand how to, you know, buy and sell crypto, then no one's going to use it. And you know, when I got redpilled uh by Nval red mecash, I pulled up my phone. I got, you know, I bought bought some. I pinged every one of my eight brokers and I said, \"Make me a price on a few million dollars of Zcash.\" uh only two out of eight were were willing to make a price because they were not allowed to by the regulators to trade privacy coins. Um if you think about the exchanges um most exchanges do not allow the trading of Zcash or other privacy coins. And so this is how >> the government prevents you from owning it. They just make it very difficult to get. >> Is there a reason that you're uh on the privacy narrative? Is there a reason that you like Ccash over Monero? So, you know, you de debate it if you want. I always thought that the Monero was the the best of the best in terms of um security coin. Maybe they've made some protocol upgrades since then, but there was a story about a um some criminal network in Japan. They were using Monero. The Japanese authorities were able to deanmize the transactions using large data sets and um some other things. And so uh the way in which and I'm not a cryptographer so correct me don't don't go nuts on me if I get this a little bit wrong. You know the way the reading secret signatures work it's not entirely foolproof. Again Zcash wasn't either while had a very small percentage of transactions that are shielded. I think now it's about 30 or 35% of the total supply is is shielded. And you know the big problem with Zcash when I was super knowledge about it back in 2016 when they launched BitMX launched the first Zcash derivative ever. It's quite an interesting um market open uh for that back in the fall of 2016. There was a question about this trusted setup that Zuko and uh Ellie and a bunch of other guys did.

So, you know, this is purely cryptographically um secure and and private assuming you have a large enough um sample set of shielded transactions. So, again, it's all about the shielded transactions. The higher that goes, the more robust the the system is. And so, you know, again, I think that's one of the reasons why I moved from the the Monero camp into the Zcash camp when when we talk about privacy coins. >> Yeah. Earlier we were talking about treasuries T bills uh and kind of the government's uh you know focus on that. Everyone considers the treasuries essentially like the risk-free rate. Um do you think that's always going to hold true or do you think there's some fragility in that market? >> Well, it is technically it is risk- free in dollar terms, right? So we have to think about in what terms is it risk- free? It is risk- free in dollar terms. The US government and no government for that matter will voluntarily ever go bankrupt. So they can always print money and pay back the holdings. So in US dollar terms a obligation of the US government is risk-f free. >> However in real money in in real terms i.e. how many how much steak can you buy? How many eggs can you buy? >> How many times can you fill up your car? >> There's real risk there. That real value of a treasury bill or a treasury bond or note fluctuates a lot and to the downside over time. And that's the the risk that you have to be concerned about. What can I do with these dollars? Who gives a [ __ ] if your bank balance is however many dollars? You could be a Zimbabwean, I know, quadrillionaire. Did it Did it actually do anything for you? No, it didn't do. What are you going to buy with this stuff? The whole point of money is not just to sit in a bank account. It's to actually do something with it. And if you can't afford to do anything with it, whatever that nominal number says on the screen or you know the amount of pieces of paper that you have stacked under your bed,"

And if you can't afford to do anything with it, whatever that nominal number says on the screen or you know the amount of pieces of paper that you have stacked under your bed, it doesn't matter. And so I think yes, it is risk- free in a fiat dollar term, but it's not risk-free in the things that we actually care about, feeding ourselves, clothing ourselves, you know, heating our homes, driving the car, that kind of stuff. In energy terms, very risky. >> Yeah. your your direction is is bullish in 2026 uh for the reasons you talked about before and I think a lot of other reasons that people are talking about. Is there any major indicator or chart or anything that invalidates that thesis and uh you know that would that would make you very bearish on 2026 2027 potentially. I mean, you could say the correction from 125,000 to 80,000 is sort of the first wave of something going down to whatever price you want, 50,000, 25,000, whatever you want to have talk about in Bitcoin. And so I would I think the easiest say, well, hey Arthur, you're talking about money printing and you know, post December 10th, Bitcoin's dropped like 5%. So obviously the market doesn't believe what you're talking about. And I would say yes, you're absolutely correct. I'm talking about a future state. I'm saying that we the market is digesting this new um acronym on money printing at least in the United States and it's going to change. That's the the risk that I'm taking and in my prognosis. And yes, you could point to where the market is today and say that you know you're full of [ __ ] Bitcoin tells you you're wrong. And I say okay well let's find out in the market. I mean the right I'm going to be wrong. I'm I'm putting my money where my mouth is and we'll see. >> For me it just keep a lot of it comes down to kind of the midterms. Like I I just can't imagine a world where all the all the levers that one could pull aren't pulled to make sure that everyone's happy during that midterm. It seems so critical to what's happening right now in the administration office.

I mean, I think politicians are in the game of getting reelected. And I think people misunderstand what Trump is. He wants to win. And the ideology that gets him to winning is whatever it makes sense. And so he tried the tariff thing. That was basically a failure. People hated it. Um it's going to cause inflation. It's a tax on consumers. No, no one really voted for that. And so now he's swung he's going to swing the other direction. It's immigration. You know, he'll be on the affordability crisis as well. He'll be taxing the rich as well. There'll be lots of [ __ ] loopholes for lawyers to pay $2,000 an hour to figure out. But I think there, you know, Trump is going to swing left um to get the ide ideology isn't doesn't matter. It's are you in my team or not. Okay. If you are, do what I say. That is how he runs the Republican party. There is no ideology. And so again, free [ __ ] always wins. He knows it wins. Hand out the goodies.

And so to think that he's not going to, you know, see that the mom donnies and, you know, the mayor election in Miami and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and uh other states where the Republicans got their asses kicked. Okay, affordability. I can do affordability. I can do handing out money to people. I got control of the Fed and the Treasury. Let's [ __ ] go. See you at the ballot box in November. I bet you're going to have some more money in your pocket and you're going to feel good and good and you're going to vote red Republican. That's I think that's what he's going to do.

And obviously right now like there's just no there's no money and like most people are really hurting right now. So, it's been that's been the opposite of all prior altcoin seasons where we were effectively in a state of quantitative easing and money came easy and people didn't have to fight crazy inflation and so we we don't see that now we haven't seen that at any point since 2021. Uh so do you think that we'll see another like do you think structurally the market is similar for all coins that it has been in the past where eventually when Trump drops enough sty checks on retail and makes affordability better. Do we see another altcoin season in in the next year or two? >> I think that people have reision revision revisionist history about altcoin season and a lot of would have could have would a shoulda. So, hey, you say you want all coin season. Let me take you back to 2016 and 17 where you had to basically some dude published some [ __ ] PDF on the internet, gave you an address and said, \"Send me money.\" >> Mhm. >> Did you send him any money?

Just sending some money to somebody on the internet. You got these things ripped, right? And a lot of people made a lot a lot of the money. Okay, let's go back to 2020, 2021.

Oh, I got to buy these things because that's what pumped in the last season. Well, this is a new season. New things pump. So either you adjust and have a framework around how you're going to appreciate what is new or you're always looking in the past and always saying all coin season isn't there because you didn't own what went up. And that's what I think people are talking about. Oh, I thought I could just open up, you know, my Coin Gecko and buy number, you know, 255 token and it's go going to go up 10x. Sorry, [ __ ] It went down. And so >> those days are gone. Yeah, >> that's gone. Use your brain. what is happening now. There is always an altcoin season happening. Most people just too afraid to participate. Hyperlid was the best story of of this cycle so far. It launched at what something around two or three bucks. Ripped all the way to to 60. That's altcoin season. Salana. Oh, it's dead. Sam's going to went to jail. No more Salana. Went down to seven bucks. All the way up to 300. A lot of people made a lot of money on that. Were you in that one? You know, probably a lot of people maybe a little bit. But did they, you know, go balls long Salana? Probably not. Again, there's been altcoin season.

I think that a trade that I like and you know, you can look on the the tokens that I allow you to see um that I own, Athena, I think is prime for a a great pump because it's a rates play. As the Fed reduces shortend rates, if this QA narrative about rever um RMPPS is correct, then Bitcoin goes up, people want to apply leverage to that. They're willing to pay more in terms of the basis to do that. And obviously Athena is the vehicle that captures uh that on chain. We saw massive um redemptions in the USD supply. I think that reverses and you know similar to September of 2024. We get a very quick pump uh quick or maybe medium-term pump in Athena as sort of this is the way to capitalize on sort of rates in the Treasury market going down but then the basis rate going up because crypto is pumping.

One of them holds a significant amount of the Robin Hood shares. Uh but if you look start looking back and forth and there's a community that's got a lot of stuff you can just go look at.

Uh central banks are tightening. Best signal that liquidity is back and forth. >> Best signal. I think you have to cut quite deep with central bank balance sheets and the banking system.
