      "text": "Ethereum is absolutely mispriced. So, I can't wait to go ahead and see it at $10,000 bare minimum is dead. We go to a 9 to12 trillion market cap and that's being conservative. Retail was here where what if also retail isn't really going to come through anymore? What if they already came in 2021? Leverage. Leverage, man. I'm I'm very deathly afraid of leverage. All right, this episode is for anyone trying to figure out what the next 6 12 months actually looks like in crypto without getting chopped in the noise because the market is sending mixed signals. You've got institutions positioning. You've got regulation as a potential catalyst and yet retail is still a question mark. So today I'm joined by David Gstein, crypto media founder and host of the breakdown with 812,000 followers on X, one of the best in the game at reading sentiment narratives and how policy hits the tape. And we've got Keith D, a former licensed investment broker and former adviser at Security Token Group who built 173,000 YouTube subscribers in 6 months, putting out macro frameworks that actually translate into crypto positioning. In this conversation, we cover three things. The clearest tells that liquidity is actually shifting. Whether the old cycle model is broken or just evolving and what happens if retail comes roaring back or if it doesn't. And the part you do not want to miss. Both of them zero in on this same danger, leverage. and why it's the fastest way to get white even in a bull market. Remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. Let's get into it. David, start us here. Why is ETH mispriced right now? Ethereum is way absolutely mispriced. everybody who I spoken to uh outside of this industry, outside of the web 3 bubble, uh you have institutional players that are legitimately buying up Ethereum. So, uh you know, the conversations about Ethereum is not going to do anything. It's going to stay at its current price point or even go further down. I I think um is absolutely mispriced. So, I can't wait to go ahead and see it at $10,000 bare minimum. >> Nice, Keith. love it. Uh I would say for me it's looking at what impact the Clarity Act can have on everything that has to do with everything outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, right? Um I think we might get some definitions of a mature blockchain network. Uh what utility tokens kind of mean and I think that that could provide a lot of support for all coins and uh the ones that actually might have some staying power down the line. So that's the thing that I think is the most mispriced is all coins having the potential to have some real big pushes especially when you also consider the potential for more liquidity coming into markets with lower interest rates and things of that nature as well. >> Cool. Let's start with that first uh liquidity. So it feels like liquidity is shifting right now um rather than expanding violently at the moment. But what are the clear signs that money is actually loosening right now and what usually moves first? Keith, we'll start with you on the on the structural side. So, the funny thing about this, uh, I have a good friend of mine that I partner with on my live show. His name is Ben Ben Levit. And he talked about how he'll often notice that NFTTS will sometimes catch a bid before a lot of the rest of the crypto market will catch up at the very minimum. Um, and I haven't fully tested that or looked at it yet, but I think that that's a very interesting thing that I need to start looking at. And then the other thing um that more traditionally I'm always trying to look at is the Russell 2000. Okay. Um and this past year has been very very interesting with that where I mean we had the Russell 2000. I'm looking now at October 2025 made a new all-time high which you know we had been waiting for for quite some time. I mean, and technically it's not an all-time high now that I actually look at it, but yearly highs, multi-year highs we made in October. Uh, but we still haven't actually made a high since October 2021. But the Russell is making its way there, whereas, you know, we saw Bitcoin obviously have a pretty good year, but the rest of crypto did not have that kind of a rise."

But the Russell is making its way there, whereas, you know, we saw Bitcoin obviously have a pretty good year, but the rest of crypto did not have that kind of a rise. So, I almost feel like there's a chance that the Russell 2000, the reason that you look at that, right, it's it's small cap stocks, right? So you've got the mega caps, large caps, midcaps, and small caps. And small cap stocks tend to perform well when there's a lot of excess liquidity because it's higher out on the risk curve, right? When I don't have anywhere to place my money that's super safe or if I want to take more risk with the money that I have, >> I'm going to put it into these small cap stocks, the Russell 2000, and the Russell 2000 has been booming, right, for the past year and a half. And I just think that that is something that might be a signal that we we do actually have easing liquidity conditions without it being clear from the rest of the markets. >> That's a good point. Uh David, what do you think people uh you know, how would you you personally uh and what do you think people might do to kind of frontr run the situation that's happening right now? >> I mean, with this liquidity coming in, how the markets are starting to form? >> The whole thing is I think I'll say this. I think social media is always late. Crypto Twitter is always late to the game. Uh so for instance, when somebody finally says like something's going up, you've had it's been going up for weeks and you're finally getting it on CT or wherever you look for or wherever you go to look for crypto information. Uh I would I already said you needed to be you needed to start doing this in 2025. the last quarter, you should have been picking up digital assets that have been out there undervalued. Like a lot of them, you mentioned uh Keith, you mentioned a lot of them didn't make all-time highs. A lot of things didn't make alltime highs. What really broke all-time highs? Bitcoin and seven other digital assets. That's it. You've had plenty of time to frontr run the market, to frontr run institutions. What have you been doing is really the question. All the data has been out there for you. All the data has been out there for you. You have Chad GBT. You have Grock. You have all these learning tools to help you. I am telling you 90% of retail has done nothing to put themselves in a good position to frontr run their institutions or this market in general. Because I'm telling you right now, gold, silver, all that is nice, but all those profits will head into crypto within the next three to six months. >> Yeah, that's a that's a really good point. Uh, you know, everything has been running really hard. Silver's best performing of 2025, ripping higher even today. Gold's been doing extremely well. Equity's been doing super well. I mean, you have Peter Schiff coming in here finally once every decade or so. He gets to come and, you know, prove himself over us who get to do the nine years out out of the 10. Um, and you know, rightfully so, he had a good year to kind of uh to to gloat about his gold performance over Bitcoin. Uh, so I guess that that leaves a question of where are we right now in the current market. You know, I mean, every single crypto run before was a four-year cycle, right? If that four-year cycle held true, you know, we would see right now that that would mean that today where we are today would be this kind of dead cap bounce or something on the way back back down lower. Is that fouryear structure? Is that four year cycle structurally dead or has it been shifted or what's going on with that?"

Is that fouryear structure? Is that four year cycle structurally dead or has it been shifted or what's going on with that? >> It's dead. But go ahead, Keith. I seen you wanted to jump in. I'm just going to say it's dead. >> I think it's it's a it's obviously the conversation right now. Um, what sucks about it is that like there's this book that I have over here. It's called This Time is Different. And it's just about how all throughout history, right, there's always some reason why, you know, this time in the market cycle is different, but really in the end, you look back and you see, well, actually, it wasn't, right? This was the same bubble formations that we've seen over and over again through history. And so um or market cycles doesn't have to be a bubble right in particular. But the thing is the thing that sucks about that is that when we really look at what has happened in this asset class over the past couple of years, we have seen a fundamental complete shift right in how the legislators are looking at this technology and just the legislations that are in place around this technology and they're coming into place within the coming weeks and potentially days. um as well as the actual way that the banks and the regulators around the entire banking system are looking at this technology. I mean, as an investor, I can't ignore the fundamentals, right? I mean, some people do choose to only do that, but I think that that can lead to you getting to you being on the wrong side of history when you have these fundamental things and shocks that bring things to the upward direction. Everyone's prepared for a shock to the downside. But what if we get things in the other direction and what if the laws that are coming into place actually do change this industry for forever? So if we look at the charts, if we look at the business cycle, have things really changed this time around? I don't know. Uh well, and last thing I'll say on this, Ralph Pow, right? He points out that the ISM hasn't ticked back up yet. Right. So maybe that's the thing that everyone's kind of still waiting for. If the ISM, the the manufacturing index can take back up to the upside, then maybe that's why we haven't had this yet is that's the sign that the business cycle itself uh hasn't given us what we've needed for crypto to actually be able to take off. So anyways, I think >> I think we've been I think we've been stuck here in in a in a bare market. I said this for for 2025. I think it's just been a bearish market and I don't think people realize that like it's it when Bitcoin is the only thing moving and and bes and to say that also in the middle of the year in 2025 it started to move down. So like it was just like we were we've been in a bearish market. Now you have institutional players that are sitting on trillions of dollars, right? They are waiting you mentioned the Clarity Act, right? They're waiting for this to pass. obviously other regulations to be put forth and passed. Then they're coming in with their money. They're not going to come into an ecosystem where regulation doesn't exist. They're going to come in. And when you mention front running, right, you better start buying now. I I I don't see, you know, I don't see I don't see this as an extension of a cycle. I see this as a beginning, if you want to use the word cycle, the beginning of it, of a cycle. How long does this last? I don't know. Maybe we've been in a long cycle, but I I believe we have another year to 18 months of whatever this is."

How long does this last? I don't know. Maybe we've been in a long cycle, but I I believe we have another year to 18 months of whatever this is. I fully believe that we go to a 9 to1 12 trillion market cap. And that's being conservative with the type of money that's out there waiting to participate. That's a conservative number for the people that will be tuning in and listening to us talk about the markets and what is going to happen moving on into the future. >> Yeah. I mean when I look at that question I think you know was the crypto fouryear cycle just a madeup thing that crypto bros used to talk about because when I do the research it seems to see that actually we have largely followed the liquidity cycle right I mean every single bull run that we saw before was really led by liquidity we haven't had institutions playing at all and when we look at altcoins David to your point we did have a I mean my portfolio was was like I could have quit at the end of 2024 before and been like really happy, you know, and that was altcoin minute. We had we had these insane meme coins going to ridiculous valuations. That was a blowoff top for altcoins. But for Bitcoin, we had the structural bid where something structurally different was happening. And so, you know, the question is now are we going back into that liquidity cycle where, you know, we have that next 12 to 18 months like you said, David, of um, you know, retail coming back and we we we all know we all have uh, you know, our own channels and we all have our audience. And, uh, Keith, I think you're a bit newer. So what you've done growing growing in a newer like growing your audience and getting the kind of views you do when this cycle is phenomenal. You'll completely explode when retail comes back. Um but you know David I know that you and I probably feel it with our our you know numbers just being down a bit more than than probably you know when it's been more popular. But um is there anything that could happen here guys uh you know in the in the you know short to midterm that would invalidate the idea that we're going to continue to go higher? I mean I I can go with Keith unless you want to go. I I'll say that the tariffs you know obviously I I think you know you saw with Poly Market and you know uh the other prediction uh sites uh prediction market sites they were um they're stating that there's a 71 or 72% chance of uh the Supreme Court you know reversing them. uh I think that could have a impact obviously on the markets and I think the markets bet on that today uh uh to happen but obviously there was no announcement and you saw the markets do it well what I liked about the markets today crypto went up for a second straight day the markets started off bad and I'm talking about TriFi they were down okay they were down and that was bullish for me because >> last year 2025 five, we kept on moving along and and and not even because like even when the stock market was moving, we were going down. So, um yeah, I I think the tariff thing can really hit and obviously if you know um I mean Jerome Pal is not going to stay. We know you know that that's not going to happen. We'll have a new Fed chair. There's so many positive things that I I'm I can't find a negative thing unless well the last thing before I give it to Keith midterms, right?"

We'll have a new Fed chair. There's so many positive things that I I'm I can't find a negative thing unless well the last thing before I give it to Keith midterms, right? Midterms if the Democrats come back into, you know, into power then, you know, the Clarity Act is not going to be passed by, you know, by this year. I I think it goes into, you know, them stalling out and then whoever is the next president kind of thing. I I I think the Clarity Act, I don't think it's a slam dunk. You have Coinbase that said we're going to withdraw if we don't get I think right now like that Clarity Act is up in the air. I I might be bearish on it right now, but it's just all the conversations that have come out where they're trying to restructure that entire bill. Maybe they're just waiting for the midterms, too. The Democrats, I think they're waiting patiently to see if they can win out and then I I think you'll see FFO happen. uh if they do win power, >> poly markets has a 32% chance that Supreme Court rules in favor of Trump tariffs. If that if that happens, is that bullish for markets or bearish for markets? >> I would imagine to be pretty bullish if if Trump is able to continue his policies. >> So, so if so, if they rule uh Supreme Court, so right now it's unlikely that they will rule in favor of Trump's tariffs. If that happens, if they vote that it's illegal for Trump's tariffs to happen, >> is that bullish or bearish? >> That'd be super bearish in my eyes. >> Um >> why why is that? Because in when the when the Trump tariffs first started rolling out, that was actually a negative thing for our markets, right? Like no one wanted tariffs. So what you're saying today is that people like tariffs and we want them to stay, especially us in the markets. What are your guys' thoughts? Yeah, I mean I I was actually very bullish during the and when I say bullish once we got the reaction that we got from the tariff implementations I was like oh this is complete fear right like this isn't actually based upon anything really uh so so the real reason I think it would be bearish is because Trump has gotten so far along in what his plan seems to be of using these tariffs as a tool to get other countries to comply with what it is that he wants them to do regarding international trade. And so if you reverse the deals that have been made, right, then yeah, that that's going to be structurally bad for markets because Trump didn't necessarily want to tank markets. He didn't necessarily want to charge these crazy high tariffs on anyone. He wanted to get back to the negotiating table and he wanted to get the deals cut that he thinks are good for America. Um, now you can, you know, I'm not here to be political. It's not really what I do. But with that idea in mind, right, imagining that that's what the goal was. Well, if you reverse that, then his entire plan kind of has an entire wrench thrown in it. When we look back to like the Mara Lago thing that was coming out from Steven before he was they were all fully in in the office. The whole thing here is to devalue the dollar, right? that they're trying to maintain the dollar status as a reserve currency of the world, but devaluing the dollar and making sure that people comply with that as they do it. So, at the end of the day, from what I understood from the Mara Lago, like they want markets to go up, but they also want to make sure that they're uh uh trying to protect American interest as they do it."

So, at the end of the day, from what I understood from the Mara Lago, like they want markets to go up, but they also want to make sure that they're uh uh trying to protect American interest as they do it. And if you throw a wrench in that plan, I mean, you got to think about how much damage has already been done. like Trump has gone and essentially taken over an entire country, right, in accordance of trying to complete this plan of growing America through I I'll set up in just a second, but going out and getting a hand his hands on one of the largest the the largest oil reserve on the planet using that as a way to keep cost down. Okay, keep cost down while increasing investment in the economy and getting interest rates down to zero. when you uh take all of the revenue that they've just generated in an attempt to get the debt to GDP picture back in place, right? If you take all of that away, then this entire plan blows up is the way that I look at it. And and now you've gone and invaded a country and everything that you're trying to do might just lead to deflation and and create other issues. Okay, I'm done. So when when we uh you know the Fed was real careful to lower interest rates when the Trump tariff started. Speculation or assumptions were that tariffs would drive up inflation. We've actually seen the opposite. We've we've seen the CPI print uh a couple days ago. CPI is lowest it's been in since 2021. Uh so it has opposite effect. Uh there's another byproduct that I think a lot of uh you know Americans in need right now are um looking forward to potentially even if they agree or don't agree with agree or don't agree with tariffs. A $2,000 rebate right now from tariff revenue is potentially something a lot of Americans can use. It's certainly not enough but it's something right and and a lot of people would really appreciate something like that right now. A reversal of Trump tariffs would probably cancel the ability for that to happen. David, what are your thoughts? Do do you agree with what Keith said on the tariffs, you know, being a a bearish thing if they're overturned or is that a bullish thing? How does uh you know, the people you talked to look at this right now? >> Yeah, I I I think it would be I think it would be mixed. You you you can say it would be bearish, but I I think so. I I remember when the tariffs were coming out, I know what the word tariff meant. A lot of people didn't, right? Like if you ask your friends, they don't know what the hell a tariff was, right? Um that that psyched out people. The markets kept on, you know, every single time Trump said tariff 50% tariff on China, 50% tariff on Iran. The markets reacted like crazy. And like we were like, \"Please stop.\" Right? We're talking if we're talking about crypto. The crypto community was like, \"Please, Trump, somebody take his phone. Please stop.\" Especially when things were like looking like they were about to pop off. No. The tariff talk, you know. So, but I think I think that the community, the entire ecosystem, uh, they're so used to the word tariff that I don't think it scares them. I heard or I not not only did I hear, but I spoke to somebody who you guys probably know. Uh, they said like, look, eliminate some of these tariffs that are uh, particularly stuck on I forgot what he said. There's tariffs that are on certain items that shouldn't be there. Leave the rest though. And I'm so sorry that I don't have the exact um item that he was speaking about. But ultimately, I think shortterm might hurt, but long run, I think we're good. Honestly, I think they'll find a way around all this stuff."

Honestly, I think they'll find a way around all this stuff. Trump is going to get things done. Look, I don't whether you you're a Democrat or a Republican, dependent, Green Party, I don't really care. You got to take off these glasses right now. the blinders that you have on right now. I know you might dislike Trump, but gas is at 2.79, right? $2.79. Exit down, milk's down. I mean, everything that you look at for the most part, it's down. Mortgage rates, they're coming down, right? We're doing all this stuff without the Fed on his side, right? The Fed chair is not on his side. 2024, Kla Harris is running for office. God bless everybody rooting for her to get in. But the Fed during like the market conditions, we all remember that he cut rates like crazy to get her in. Trump right now, if we can have somebody on the same page, right? Hope I wish we had the Fed on the same page. This market gas prices would be much a lot of things would be even lower right now, especially mortgage rates and him putting a 10% cap on credit cards. That's good. The banks are coming out. Guess what the banks are saying? Oh my god, this is terrible for the consumer. Consumers are paying 30% right now. You're telling me 10% is going to be terrible? Oh, because they're not going to be lending as much. You know what? A lot of people in the United States of America should not have credit cards. They shouldn't. They don't know how to use them. The direct uh the Department of Education has been absolute trash. Okay? They haven't taught people how to, you know, absolutely focus on their finances. No, they've never taught anybody how to go ahead and go about their finances. Parents, they don't know how to use, you know, they ended up in debt as well. So, like I I I think, not to go and start rambling, I think it'll be bearish. Might be bearish short-term, but long term I think we'll be just fine. You know, these three years are are going to be big. And it all comes down to again the midterms. >> Yeah. >> Who's going to win? The Democrats or the Republicans? If the Democrats win, it's going to be hard to get anything done. Does Trump get rid of the or does the Senate get rid of the filibuster? The all these things are at play right now. They get rid of the filibuster to pass a lot of these things that will help the economy continue to grow. I'm rooting for it, man. I am rooting for it. >> Yeah. I mean, I know what tariffs were because I just moved back to the United States in earlier this earlier in 2025. Uh, but I lived in Thailand for 8 years before that. And to buy a car that was imported, you were paying, you know, 100% tariff on that. And this is why I'm a little bit confused. I we don't need to go down the tar the tariff thing anymore, but uh and I and I don't know much about the policy. I don't know why they're trying to overturn it. I just know that every other country I've ever lived in or been to all has tariffs on imports. I don't know why it's it's it's any different for us. Um, but anyway, uh, geopolitics, global uncertainty, black swan risks, are those concerning to any of you guys?"

I mean I am all in right now personally on crypto bitcoin ETH you know I was I was uh you know predominantly Bitcoin at the start of 2025 I migrated 6040 on the two on the those two majors 60 60 ETH 40 Bitcoin on the ratio I think ETH out performed Bitcoin in the in the bulletin ahead um I do still have you know that that that allocation size takes about 60 70% of my portfolio my liquid assets the rest is high conviction alts um So, I do have a small leverage position. It's actually not that small, but it's pretty low LTV. Uh, I'm actually considering closing that out because of the geopolitical uncertainty right now. You know, that move in Venezuela, Keith, wasn't just about oil, as you know. It was a it was really a move to keep China and Russia off of the Western Hemisphere. Um, and uh and China had spent hundred billion dollars. They were basically had the deal done. Imagine if you had gone in there, put in all that work, all that diplomacy with Maduro, had the deal done, you were counting that $14 trillion, $17 trillion, whatever, and then boom, someone comes in overnight and stops the whole thing from happening. H you might be able to get away with that once, but uh you know, I mean, to me, this whole thing is pretty crazy. I I'm going to put my tinfoil hat on for just a quick second, too, because I want to frame this. And you know, I just got back from uh some the the Central America is looking for some some property in case things go a little bit crazy. Um but there I'm just going to like I don't want to talk about it, but like there was also USPS like a postal letter sent out. I don't know if you guys saw it that was the same one they sent out when CO started saying that you know uh basically hey reminder to all USPS employees. You guys are government employees. if a pandemic or civil unrest h happens. Um just know that like if you get pulled over by the police for breaking curfew, you can show them this letter. Like you have the right to continue to your duties in the line of a of emergency. It's been sent out when CO started and then January 5th. Like what are I don't know why they would do that right now, but it hasn't been between then. Just again it popped up. It was weird to me. Things are weird out there right now. Wondering about the block swan potentially happening. You guys concerned about that at all? Are you in leverage? How do you play that? >> I stay I stay out of leverage um because I feel like that's always a possibility and I mean we've definitely not seen such a volatile leadership in the United States in I mean ever besides the first time he was there. Um and uh I was just talking to someone earlier today or on my my live show. We were talking about how, you know, when Trump says something, right? Like when he's saying things, he's not just saying things, right? He's he's very clearly making it known that when he says something, right, he's willing to act on that. And now that's great for, you know, having things being telegraphed and having a clue of what may come next. But, um, it also means that like things can actually go down. And for me, you know, talking about China uh in Venezuela, well, I listened to Simon Dixon. He's obviously awesome. I know you've had him. >> Amazing. Yeah."

And for me, you know, talking about China uh in Venezuela, well, I listened to Simon Dixon. He's obviously awesome. I know you've had him. >> Amazing. Yeah. >> And my initial thought was, well, now China can take Taiwan, right, without there being anything for us to say about it. Like, they can go ahead and do that now. >> But I think Simon Dixon was like, he was like, well, they don't actually want Taiwan like that. Um, and basically he was like, who would really have to step in if China did try to go for Taiwan was Japan. And so he was like, \"So Trump can he he's like, \"Well, you go ahead. You you do whatever you want over there because that actually doesn't even really involve me. Japan needs to step in instead.\" So anyways, so Black Swans geopolitical events, I think, is the big thing to be looking out for without a doubt. Um, and yeah, leverage. Leverage, man. I'm I'm very afraid of leverage, especially when my crypto's involved. Yeah, >> David, how would you like are you is that on your radar at all? Uh, you know, if like do you have any strategies around something like that h might happen? Do you keep like are are you keeping cash on on the sidelines in case an event like that happens? Are you all in on spot? Do you trade leverage? Like what are your thoughts? >> I'm just spa DCA. Everybody knows that spa DCA. I I do have obviously and I think everybody should have 15% uh you know pout on the side just in case you never know Bitcoin goes down you can buy cheaper Ethereum goes down whatever you can get in cheaper uh you know God bless everybody who plays in leverage you know I have nothing but me I'm good I I'm not chasing money I I I let money come to me I don't want to chase you know I always say that um I I will say that that's been in the back of my because obviously Trump's in office whether you like him or not. Uh at least we have somebody with a pulse uh that's in office right now. Biden, you know, my views on Biden. I I don't know what the hell was going on during the last four years. All I know is that everything started to go up. That's it. And my concern is the economy. My concern is about America. You know, that that's it. That's how I look at it. I I want America to be great. Uh, I want the economy to be great where I, you know, I grew up in Brooklyn. I want, you know, I want the people of Brooklyn to have an opportunity to, uh, participate in this ecosystem. Uh, we need more workshops. I see Trump being in office as a benefit, but there are people that like like China and like other countries, they despise it right now. They they hate the fact that he's in office because they had their way with us for the last four years. And that's the truth. Like China has, you know, like they've gone around to countries, especially with in our territory, and they've negotiated deals. Uh we're speaking of the one that holds the most oil, you know, reserves on the planet. You know, what a hundred billion dollars, you know, given to them by China, uh all these years to prop them up. You know, I'm happy that the US did what they did. I mean, they liberated at the same I know it wasn't about liberation. I'm not going to act like it was, but part of it, hey, they liberated you still. They still have work to do because the second the command took over. So, I mean, the job's not finished there. But, you know, they did get assets, right?"

But, you know, they did get assets, right? Which will benefit the United States of America if they can refine the oil because that, you know, that oil is hard to go ahead and refine. Um, Greenland is next. I think like we're going to talk politics. I mean, Trump is I agree with Keith here when he says something. Listen, because he's not playing like he I think people thought he was playing around with the move that he just made. He's not playing around with this Greenland thing. He's not playing around with Iran. Like with these things like he he's going to do it. So, could there be a Black Swan event where we have a co part two? I can see that. Yeah. You know what? One of my close friends said watch. I think they're gonna try to pull another one like this because look what Trump's doing. Whether you like him or not, the economy is better, right? What way to go ahead and put a wrench in it. Come out with something like, you know, COVID 19, man. >> Yeah. I mean, that was kind of getting where I was leading to next. Uh we know we know that the big beautiful bill now law passed which, you know, required us raising the debt ceiling. There's a proposed $5 trillion in spending. They raised the military uh separately. They recently raised the military defense budget to $ 1.5 trillion which is astronomical and the only way to to you know really do all the spending is to increase print more money. Uh in the last time I had a black swan or last time that we had the last time people were okay with rapid devaluation of the US dollar was because we had a crisis on our hands. We know that likely in 2026, potentially 2027, we're gonna also see a pretty big rapid devaluation of the US dollar. I mean, there's some offset there with dollar exporting through stable coins, but curious like what do you guys think allows uh the public this time? Last time was co like, oh, we we need to do this, we need to spend money, we you know, we need to print, we need to give people stimulus checks. How do we go about it this time around? I hate printing. I I just, you know, like I I I don't know, you know, I'm not an expert. You know, I did run for office, but I'm not an expert on on this particular topic. Like what what should you do in this kind of situation? Like I I I didn't fault them for printing, right? It's like we got hit with this pandemic, right? Nobody's seen this before, you know? Like nobody's able to go to work. Everybody's staying home. It's remote and all this. I Okay, I get it. What do you do? God forbid if it happens again, man. Like, this is I mean, we go over $40 trillion. It's crazy. It is absolutely insane. Like, I I I don't I don't know. I don't even have a good answer. >> Keith, maybe Keith does. I don't know. >> No. No. Um I do want to point back to the thing that you were saying to about the increase in the defense budget because it kind of comes back to something I was trying to illustrate on earlier, right? So, so Trump is saying that he wants to raise the defense budget by 50%. Right? And this is why this is the real reason why trying to roll back the tariffs would just ruin everything in his plan, right? If he's going to go out and then be an imperialist and kind of, you know, go out and take all these countries. He's going to need a larger defense budget."

If he's going to go out and then be an imperialist and kind of, you know, go out and take all these countries. He's going to need a larger defense budget. But if he does that, he's going to have to have something to actually subsidize, right? the fact that he's uh uh raising that budget and that 300 billion or so that he raised last year through tariffs would be really nice to have uh out of the 500 billion that he needs extra. So I just wanted to come back to that because that is a big part of the plan here. And when you um and and otherwise right now you're going to have to print money which is going to be much more inflationary pressures that you're pushing up on the world without uh uh being able to necessarily combat that as well. So anyways, but moving forward to I kind of got lost a little bit there. Um >> just wondering wondering if though if you think that there's going to be some sort of public narrative around um because probably and let me know if you guys disagree with this, but I I guess the way that our market goes up is the dollar goes down. The reason dollar goes down is because our spending is way up. The way we, you know, the way we justify spending is printing more money. Um we had a reason for that last time. It was co uh maybe it is. Maybe maybe that's it. Maybe you just pointed out, Keith, maybe maybe one of those reasons is military spending, you know, geopolitics, but I'm just wondering if there's anything else that you thought of. If not, it's fine. We can move to something else. >> Yeah. Yeah. And then on the um I mean, there's so much to talk about there with what really happened in 2020, right? Like >> Yeah. I don't know. This will get this is YouTube, brother. We got to be careful there, you know. >> Yeah. I I usually only use that word. I'll say the whole year, right, is the only thing that I'll mention, >> but just an idea. uh Jim Rickards, he he wrote a book called Currency Wars. >> Yeah. >> And in that book, he uh very much so outlines how uh Russia, China, and so on and so forth have his job was to play out scenarios of how these countries could try to compete with the US dollar by creating any sort of trade routes or whatever types of, you know, wars and stuff or whatever they could try to do to dethrone the dollar. And he doesn't bring up right this type of a concept in general. But just to think though that there's someone whose job and his this was like 2011 right his job was to come together and sit down and think about what are the different ways that a country could could create economic warfare in a world where kinetic warfare kind of becomes irrelevant when you have nuclear weapons. Right. We're not really going to go there anymore. Hopefully not. So, um, you know, maybe that is exactly what was happening there. It was some form of economic warfare. And when we, um, look forward to right now, I think you've made a great point, Kyle. Maybe that is exactly what could be on the horizon to prevent something like this from happening because what defense do you have against another one of those types of events? You really don't have much of a way to stop that from happening. So >> yeah, I mean on the there's a lot we can talk about currency wars and the way that well we have really you know and that well said too about the fact that the way that war is changing. I mean we are you know like the United States is essentially at war."

I mean we are you know like the United States is essentially at war. It's a cold war with you know China and Russia things like that right now. um especially with the bricks nations you know and bricks is clearly not standing down you know creating the units and it's the kind of test net environment right now backed by gold in a basket of uh the bricks uh currencies those nations are cheely are clearly choosing gold as their kind of uh as their store of value has identically been in a in an identity crisis uh you know Satoshi said it was be a peer-to-peer cash small blocks decided that it would be a temporary, you know, the narrative we the people decided to be the the narrative would be store value digital gold. Um, and with that being said, it also falls in between a high beta risk asset and a hedge against inflation. I guess you could say historically the narrative has been a a hedge against inflation. The reality has it's acted as a high beta risk asset. Do you think that that identity crisis will continue? Are we in a in a kind of a shift from that? Where will where will Bitcoin sit in the next 6 to 12 months? >> I've always had a beef with this concept of uh is it peerto-peer cash or is it a store of value? Right? I've always had beef on that because it really doesn't very easily serve as both, right? Because if it's cash, I'm not gonna spend it, brother. I'm gonna if if it's a store of value, then I'm not going to spend it, right? So, anyways, I just wanted to point that out. But >> how about more more so more so let's focus on the the high beta risk asset that moves with liquidity versus a a legitimate store of value. Uh I mean that's pretty relevant to where we are right now. We have uh the US creating the strategic reserve has yet to actually acquire any Bitcoin which I think is unfortunate. You know my own opinions on that I'll keep it brief is just the the cabal suppressing price until they have enough and until they start buying it because the second they do everything changes. But uh but I I do I I do wonder I think everyone's wondering that right now like when will Bitcoin make that leap from that uh that high beta asset to an actual kind of standalone store of value maybe sitting closer to the way gold moves. >> I I think we're looking honestly five, seven years, maybe 10 before it does that. You know what? We like right now it's a store of so we're privileged in the United States of America. We can hold Bitcoin. We can we can buy it, hold it, DCA. We don't need to use it. Like really, we don't. You don't hear that in other countries. They use Bitcoin. That's the difference. >> So, Americans spoiled, we can, you know, we don't have to use it. whereas other countries uh are using it and and that's just the difference. At some point hopefully and and it's been you know moving in that direction we go back to peerto-peer we go back to peerto-peer and and and you know I see that happening. I do see that happening. But you you'll have more than just Bitcoin that will be doing peer-to-peer uh you know transactions. You'll have Litecoin."

But you you'll have more than just Bitcoin that will be doing peer-to-peer uh you know transactions. You'll have Litecoin. I mean I know I mentioned Litecoin just because it's being used everywhere now even in in the United States of America not just to hold you know not just to hold a digital asset people are using it so for transactions it was meant right Satoshi created it to use it for transactions it was being used uh in in that way in that fashion and then somewhere down the line people decided to just hold and and call it call it a store of value and now institutions are doing the same thing, right? I mean, Michael Sailor's holding. He's not spending it. He's holding like he is buying and holding, you know, and other, you know, other companies are doing the same thing. So, I think 5 10 years from now, we'll finally see people using, you know, stats to go ahead and pay for stuff because it'll be at that point where you can go ahead and and use it. But again, that's for America. other countries. I believe they're already using Bitcoin for its intent and purposes. >> I love that. One of the things that I always try to envision as well too is so let's imagine Bitcoin as the store of value and then you obviously have the lightning network. You have ways to use it for transactions that are efficient. But I also think about what if there was a world where Bitcoin becomes a store of value in that, you know, value layer of the internet or however you want to look at that. But but but it's not necessarily where all the transactions are being settled, right? So you use Bitcoin and you use a Satoshi unit as the thing that you measure against for instance fiat currencies like the dollar. >> Mhm. >> But you actually pay with something else like the Satoshi actually becomes a denominator, but you use other things to pay. So that's kind of how I actually potentially see how the world could move forward. It's probably a crazy loopy way of looking at it, but um but but yeah, I think we've got some time before these countries fully start to acquire, but that is happening, right? We're at that point where countries are saying, \"Yes, we are essentially holding this as a reserve asset,\" which is a crazy thing to say out loud, but we are seeing it. The Middle East has been vocal about this, right? But then we look and we start to see on uh you know, when we start to do some investigations, we see that there's other countries that have just been stacking Bitcoin as well. So, yeah, I think before it's like a real official thing, we we probably do have like five, 10 years. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> But look at the institutions like they're and I don't mean to cut you off. I just wanted to get this in. The institutions, they're not talking about peerto-peer. They're they're telling all their clients, hey, you got to get into this asset. So, they're pushing it more towards like this is an asset. This is gold. This is digital gold. That's the way they're explaining everything. And who's going to a CVS or I don't know Sam's Club with a bar of gold to go ahead and, you know, pay for their products? Nobody. So, you know, that that right now is what their vision is. So, that that's why I kind of like did not want institutions to come into the game in the first place. But the institutions have been here since the beginning. I I think I think a lot of people don't even acknowledge that institutions have been here. They're they just made it official. You know that that's the difference."

You know that that's the difference. >> And now they're telling all their clients, you're gonna get into our products, right? >> The biggest thing I get hit with is David, you talk about decentralization. This looks very centralized to me. And that's that's my now that's my new debate. Forget about telling people about getting into Bitcoin and why they need to have it. Now I'm in conversations of whether it's really decentralized or centralized now because now you got products and you know what institutions do they make more products because that's how they make money. >> I think people often you know they they often confuse like the governance layer of Bitcoin versus the you know versus the actual unit of accounts. And so you know when you look at most assets around the world they tend to be hoarded by you know elite few people and the rest kind of trinkle spread out between everyone else. So if you look at the concentration of Bitcoin in and who's holding it then yeah it's it's fairly centralized u you know especially in America right now but if you look at like the the voting power and people are running nodes and miners around the world even though the miners are in pools and they're big you know they they still have to agree with each other and then the validators are running people running nodes also uh pretty decentralized on you know in 2013 I left fiat and I I I bought Bitcoin and I've been spending it you know I I kind of stopped after a while but like that's all I had to spend for a a long time, you know. So, I used to I started with thousands and now I've significantly less than that. Um, looking back in hindsight, it would have been nice to just go get a job at McDonald's or something and live within my means for 10 years and then, you know, been super rich. But I spent along the way. I bought a Harley for my birthday in 2015 that now would have been a million and a half dollars, you know. Uh, so, uh, it doesn't make sense, you know, to if if you earn in Bitcoin, then you can spend in Bitcoin and then you just live in that, right? if you if you have your Bitcoin and you're holding aside like why would you spend it and get rid of it um when there's so much more adoption to happen like I think you know I I actually you know David when I first asked you the question I thought maybe the answer in my mind without thinking through it until you kind of answered and I thought about it for a second I would have thought that like maybe this is maybe it's this year or something like that but the the reality is is that uh there needs to be a really good reason I think uh for people to adopt it you know you you already called out a lot of countries are using it for its intended purposes I was just in central America and I was surprised to see so many counters of pay with Bitcoin. I couldn't believe it. Um and you know they were all had apps that were built in the lightning network and people were using it every day down there."

I couldn't believe it. Um and you know they were all had apps that were built in the lightning network and people were using it every day down there. But inevitably, you know, the fiat systems will all fail around the world and uh and by that time, you know, no people won't have any when you're when the dollar starts to look like a Venezuelan Bolivia or whatever it is, you know, then then you jump to something that, you know, has a a finite supply and can't be inflated away likely that peer-to-peer digital cash, you know, uh analogy comes back in when price becomes less volatile and people don't worry about spending it because it's just, you know, it fluctuates a few basis points every single day or something like that. That's maybe what I'm thinking. >> That's why that's Kyle. That's why I go back to what I said about the Americans being spoiled. Why would you sell Bitcoin if everybody's telling you it's going to a million dollars? >> Yeah. Like what reason would you have especially if you're if you were early to Bitcoin as well. >> What if every single person uh Black Rockck uh you know Vanguard uh Arc like when Ca Kathy comes out and says it's going to a million why would you sell? That's the first thing that like I would say like I'm not selling then it's going to a million per coin. Once it hits a million, then I'll think about, you know, you know, taking some profits, right? Or nobody's thinking about using it here. That's why it's encouraging to see all the banana republics using Bitcoin to go ahead and make payments or or transact because they need it. They're not holding for a million. They need to go ahead and pay for stuff. And they don't have a monetary system. It's been broken. I mean Nigeria, they printed themselves to death, right? People are using Bitcoin to go ahead and transact. So these are the countries, you know, that you got to look at and say, okay, they're using it for its purpose. America is not the country to look at, you know, I respectfully it's just not the country that you analyze bit Bitcoin store value in America. Everywhere else it's peer-to-peer. That's how I feel. So, I think we all kind of agree that this is going to be a really great year. And today, on a day like today, which, you know, yesterday, but mostly today, which again, for those of you guys are watching, we're filming on Wednesday, January 14th, uh we saw a crazy run from intraday low of 92,000 to where it sits right now, $97,000. uh the whole market's moved up, but you know, ETH and Bitcoin were still on the on the upper edge of what's moved and they typically move first. We've we saw a lack of interest from retail. I'm wondering from you guys, what do you think it's going to take to get retail back in the market so we get, you know, and will we get this kind of uh altcoin season that we all love so much? >> I have the perfect answer. >> Go for it. >> Go for it. >> Money. Yeah, >> retail has been any and this gets me frustrated. Every single time I tune in to some podcast or a live stream and I hear people say retail was here. Where? What are you talking about? Re $1.23 trillion in consumer credit card debt. You have subprime loans. Nobody's talking about them. They're backed up. Okay, that looks like it might be a black swan event if you want to talk about black swans, right? Nobody's talking about subprime. People are behind on their rent, on their bills. They're not thinking about crypto. They're not thinking about any market. They're thinking about surviving."

So, if Trump does come out with them $2,000 stmmies, tariff checks, whatever you want to call them, once people do their tax returns and they get back, well, as has been stated by the administration, some of the biggest returns in the history of the United States of America, that rates lower. Now, you'll see retail start to participate. more people will take a chance and say, \"You know what? I'm going to use this money and I'm going to try to 10x 5x. I'm going to try to make money on my money.\" Until then, retailers in no situation >> to come into the market. If somebody said, \"If I have $1,000, what do I do with it?\" I go, you know what you do? You keep your job and you slowly DCA into something. You do not at all go all in if you only have $1,000 to your name. First of all, don't even put the $1,000 in. You got to make sure if you could pay your rent. >> This is where we're at in America right now, which is pretty sad because America should not have people working three jobs, okay? Three jobs, be behind on rent. We need we really need to fix our own right now. And I've said stated this a lot. Fix our own. Fix everything here. Make sure our veterans are good. get rid of the homeless situation that we currently ex the drug epide, you know, sometimes we need to be a little bit selfish for the American people here. >> Keith, any thoughts? >> One of the things that I was always concerned, I mean, that that to me is a very proper explanation, right, of what's going on. That that is true, right? there's not a lot of discretionary income at all. Um, the other thing that I've also been thinking about over the past year and a half here is what if also retail isn't really going to come through anymore? Like in some ways I question whether u and I'm happy to be super wrong about this, but the people who would ever come into this market, what if they already came in 2021? like what if that was the last wave of new people that would actually ever take this stuff seriously because I and this is probably myopic of me but I I feel like sometimes there's just a certain demographic there's a certain percentage of people who are just never going to participate in this no matter what happens and maybe we've reached that limit of people you know what I mean I don't know I think that's I don't think that that's right but I'm just suggesting to think about that too like maybe there is no new entrance into the market they all got burned and they'll never come back again. >> I thought about that. >> Anyway, we need a catalyst. I think that, you know, the catalyst for me from 2021 was Rory Kerry, right? He came out, you had Main Street come together and they were destroying the hedge funds where to the point where hedge funds were going on CNBC and they were crying how their retail messing our industry, right? And that was fun to watch. Me, I sitting back, I was laughing. You had major names appearing on every single channel saying, \"How dare retail? How dare retail cost us so much money.\" Meanwhile, the same hedge funds send, you know, companies into bankruptcy. And there are no halts. There are no triggers to hold the markets. Meanwhile, that was happening with AMC and GameStop. We're missing a catalyst. That's that's that's also besides the money. The catalyst part. >> Yeah. brings a lot of people together, unites people and says, \"Let's go in. Let's go in.\" Cuz that's what happened."

The catalyst part. >> Yeah. brings a lot of people together, unites people and says, \"Let's go in. Let's go in.\" Cuz that's what happened. And then it trickled. I feel like that trickled into crypto. Once they got done with AMC and GameStop and everything else, it went to Dogecoin, Shibbeinu, memes, and then it went into utilities. And then at the end of the day, if you didn't roundtrip, you went into Bitcoin, and you put some on to the side. Most people round trip. So Keith, I think a lot of people who roundt tripped, they have a bitter taste in their mouth. You know, you know, a lot of Kos's influencers get blamed for a lot of stuff and deservingly so there are some that should be, but at the end of the day, it's, you know, a lot of people round trip stuff. They don't know how to take profits. You're to blame. You need to figure out that you need to scale out in the green and buy in the red. And it's very simple, but hard to execute. Yeah, Keith, I thought about what you said a lot too. Um, of course, you know, David, in 2021, that was kind of the tail end of a massive QE, you know, uh, type of environments, which seems like that's where we're we're starting those days right now. QT ended December 1st and, uh, we are all pretty certain that we're going to see, you know, interest rates trying to get to one or near one. I don't know if that takes the end of next year or the year after that, but that's the direction that um you know the administration is pushing for and bringing in likely has sat Kevin Hasset who's just nominated. So the thing is, Keith, when someone gets burned in the casino, they say, \"Man, I'm never going back to Vegas again.\" But you give them a year or two, buddy's like, \"Hey, you want to go to Vegas? They got a couple extra bucks in their pocket. [ __ ] yeah. Let's go to Vegas.\" You know, and it happens again. And all coin seasons are all about casinos. And I I you know, I mean, I roundt tripped it before and you swear next time you're going to do you're going to do better. But but you know, you always think that it's going to go up and greed gets the best at you. But for that reason, if we get the right liquidity environments, you know, I think they're going to come back. I just think it's been uh, you know, we need that money to support the ecosystem. And right now, it's being spent being spent at the highest levels. It's going to continue to be spent. That'll trickle back down in people's pockets. Midterms coming up. Hopefully, we start, you know, they literally just helicopter dropping air drops into Americans hands, you know, and we get the we get what they say that they this is the year of the golden age, baby. So, let's as Trump has said before, you know what you rightly mentioned, Keith, what he says he does. Uh, you know, let's let's hope that this is actually the golden age, guys. Um, anything else to add before we we shut it down today? >> No, man. This is this is a lot of fun. I appreciate you having me on. >> I appreciate both of you guys. Uh, David, anything else? >> I just want to say I appreciate you guys. Appreciate you, Keith. And uh obviously Kyle uh I I think we will have a phenomenal 2026 if >> the way things are going. I think it's going to be great. Uh not just for Americans, I think globally uh the economy uh will continue to go up and I really do see retail coming back. But yes, we we need to get those checks out to them."

But yes, we we need to get those checks out to them. I don't want to print, but it's inevitable. So, I'd like to see them get checks and get on their feet and participate in the markets. Not as exit liquidity as everybody would put it, but to really participate in the markets and and hopefully they win. Not everybody's going to win, but uh you have the opportunity at least to get in and uh you know, and do something. So, I mean, God bless all of us and um hope hope for the best, man. I hate all these wars and all this stuff that's going on. Uh regardless of what political side I'm on. Uh I hate wars. Um but it is what it is, man. Uh there's a silent fight going on between all these countries. Uh and and a lot of this stuff is above our pay grade. So we're just here, right? We're just on microphones. We're trying to, you know, get that generational wealth like everybody else. >> Well said. Uh guys who are listening, if you uh aren't following Keith or David yet, I'm going to leave leave the social links in the description below. Make sure you go follow them, guys. Thank you so much for being here. Appreciate it. And everyone, guys, have a great day, guys. I appreciate you sticking with us for this entire interview. I hope you got a lot of value from it.
