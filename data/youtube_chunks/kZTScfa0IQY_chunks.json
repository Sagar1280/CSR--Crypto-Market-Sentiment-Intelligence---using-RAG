      "text": "President Trump is leading the way to a crypto revolution. >> If you hold cryptocurrency, this is big news for you. It is official. US Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott has announced that the crypto market structure bill markup happens this week. It is happening. Posts Senator Cynthia Lumis. It is officially happening. The digital asset space is critical to American economic dominance across the globe. >> Smash the like button, guys. Let's get this information out there to as many people as possible. If you know someone who holds cryptocurrency, send them this information so they know that this weekend is a brief calm before the storm of crypto market structure markup on Thursday. Thursday. Everyone's working like crazy to make it happen, but none more than the tireless Senate banking staff pouring themselves into this extraordinary task. \"Thank you for your heroic efforts,\" writes prominent crypto lawyer Jake Travinsky. \"So, this is the official statement they put out regarding what's to come this week. Chairman Senator Tim Scott is moving forward on digital asset market structure legislation delivering clear rules that protect Main Street, keep innovation here at home, and safeguard US national security. Crypto market structure is a huge issue for chair Tim Scott. He wants to make this happen. >> We must innovate before we regulate. That means allowing innovation to have happen here at home in the digital asset space is critical to American economic dominance across the globe. The good news is President Trump is leading the way to a crypto revolution starting here at the banking committee and that's why we've moved very quickly the Genius Act focusing on the crypto world. That's how you get things done. It's passed through my committee in a bipartisan fashion. Next, market structure on its way to be heard in the committee, marked up, and I believe passed into law. >> So, the statement that chairman Tim Scott put out in regards to the market structure legislation markup that happens this Thursday. And just to remind you, what is a markup? In Congress, a markup is the critical committee process where lawmakers debate, propose amendments, and rewrite a bill before it moves to the full House or Senate for a vote. Essentially marking up the legislation with changes, deletions, and additions until the committee agrees to report a final version, often as a clean bill, to their chambers. So, this is a step in the process, a necessary step. This shows you that things are moving forward because after this comes the official vote. So Tim Scott writes, \"This legislation is about making America the crypto capital of the world. So the next generation of jobs and innovation is built here, not overseas. When we set clear rules, we give entrepreneurs the confidence to start companies, hire workers, and grow right here in the United States. We also make it harder for criminals and foreign adversaries to use new technology to rip off Americans or undermine our financial system. After months of serious bipartisan work, it's time to move this forward and deliver clear results for the American people. Senator Tim Scott has been pushing for positive crypto legislation a long time. >> There's a common belief that moneyaundering is easy with crypto, but the truth is it's not. Blockchain technology creates a permanent traceable ledger that can help law enforcement catch those bad actors. >> I mean, even before Trump became president for the second time, Tim Scott was on TV saying, \"Bitcoin's future has to be in America. We're going to make sure that innovation happens here in America.\" Bitcoin was only 67,000. >> Bitcoin's future has to be in America. What we're going to do is make sure that innovation happens in America. That means that the regulations cannot be oppressive and we cannot have an SEC nominee that actually wants to run it back to China or run it out of the country. >> So the markup happens this Thursday. The vote on the clean bill shouldn't happen too much longer after that. And remember, the crypto bill framework proposes simple things, straightforward things, common sense things like defining digital assets, regulating a security versus a commodity, reducing regulation for digital assets, and in other ways increasing common sense regulations so people know the rules and preventing money laundering and sanction evasion. People, companies, entities need these rules defined so they can work and operate in America. And remember, this is a bipartisan bill. This is a common sense bill. Like, you know who's stopping the Clarity Act? You know who's delaying and stalling the Clarity Act from happening? Because it was supposed to happen last year. It is the banks and traditional financial institutions."

Like, you know who's stopping the Clarity Act? You know who's delaying and stalling the Clarity Act from happening? Because it was supposed to happen last year. It is the banks and traditional financial institutions. Banks realize that stable coins are the future of the financial economy. It gives more freedom to the people and less power to the banks. So the major bottleneck that has delayed and stalled the clarity act, the major bottleneck from the bipartisan representation passing the clarity and market structure laws which will fully open the floodgates of crypto adoption is coming from the same banking lobby that created chokepoint and has their foot on the neck of crypto since day one. Why? Because blockchains threaten banks and they are fighting for their own existence. Stable coins give the people yield. Banks usually keep that yield. They don't want to give the people extra yield. They're fighting to keep that yield. Banks are fighting to not allow stable coin holders to earn 3 to 5%. Why? Because they know if they do, trillions of bank dollars will drain into crypto stable coin wallets. But I have faith. I'm bullish. I believe pro- crypto legislation, bipartisan crypto market structure legislation, is about to be passed in America this year. And most people don't realize. So, can you really afford not to buy Bitcoin when Bitcoin's only 90K today? Especially with huge catalyst number two coming for the cryptocurrency market and equity market and a lot of different risk assets and other assets. Fed rate cuts with a new Fed chair. The printer is coming. Here in this recent clip, Trump talks about, hey, we just need rates down. They can raise rates later. We need rates down now. and he's already selected and ready to announce his new Fed chair. >> And if we had a good Fed chairman, you would lower rates. And you know what? If inflation happened in a year from now or two years, let him raise rates. But we're going out for long-term debt or short-term debt. We have a lot of debt coming due because Biden had all short-term debt mostly. And we would get a lower rate and a lower interest rate if this guy would lower rates. We get a lower interest rate. It's unbelievable. And he's worried about inflation. If he worries about inflation any longer, all he has to do is get the lower rate. Let us go out borrow at a much lower rate. Much lower. You could go down a point or two. We'll go out borrow and if in two years inflation comes back, he raises rates. >> But he keeps him the same. It's just it's insane. >> I know it's 2026 when his term expires. So you're already thinking about it. >> It's coming out very soon. >> Were you thinking about >> I could tell you, but uh I don't think I'll make I have a pretty good idea. very highly. >> What do you make of the Ayatollah say? >> So the crypto market structure legislation will be huge for the cryptocurrency market in the US and around the world. Is that all? No. What comes next? This a different congressman is pro Bitcoin, pro crypto, and he is one of the people spearheading the strategic Bitcoin reserve bill. Trump already did the executive order to make it more sticky and kind of define it more. They're doing the strategic Bitcoin reserve bill along with other things that are pro- crypto too like no capital gains tax. Listen, >> Bitcoin reserve. Carlson Davidson joins me now. Carson, a series of questions here. Number one, what is a Bitcoin reserve? What does it do and how do you build it? >> Well, uh, first of all, the president created a strategic reserve of Bitcoin in part because the United States government didn't have like a single custodian."

Carson, a series of questions here. Number one, what is a Bitcoin reserve? What does it do and how do you build it? >> Well, uh, first of all, the president created a strategic reserve of Bitcoin in part because the United States government didn't have like a single custodian. you had every agency uh in the government that might have had an asset, seized an asset or anything else uh any kind of digital asset, they they didn't have custody of it. So they were losing track of the private keys. So essentially when you lose your keys, you lose it's like losing a pile of cash. Yeah. >> So they created an organized way and put it under treasury to say, \"Hey, we're going to have a single custodian for all of the Bitcoin.\" Kind of like Fort Knox for crypto, right? And then they said, \"Well, not all cryptos created equally. Bitcoin we want to hold on to. It's an appreciating asset over a long period of time. Some of these other things we should just sell them off and buy more Bitcoin.\" Uh, but they wanted to do it in a deficit neutral way. Um, and I think a lot of people have been like, \"Well, well, how else do you put money in there?\" And so we're introducing uh legislation that not only codifies that executive order, so there's a common sense way to have custody for the Bitcoin and other digital assets, but uh you can contribute. So when you pay your taxes, you can pay your taxes in Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is currency in that sense and there's no capital gains. >> My name is Aaron at Altcoin Daily.
