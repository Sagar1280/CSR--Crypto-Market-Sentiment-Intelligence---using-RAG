      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coinbau Trading. Today, we're going to talk about why the current pullback is probably over and the catalyst that could cause the crypto market to bounce and rally in the coming days. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different, and if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So to start off guys, I want to basically point out the fact that on Monday I had warned that we could see a pullback like we saw over the last 24 hours because we still needed to see Bitcoin fill the CME gap left from New Year's Day around 88,000 and Ethereum also had a CME gap from New Year's Day around 3,000. And that's basically what happened yesterday. So it was kind of within expectations, but of course that did freak out a lot of people and everyone's wondering is it over? Are we going to have another crash lower? Uh is the bare market finally here? Or many people would argue that it already is. But in my view, guys, this is something I've pointed out in previous videos. My kind of threshold for what counts as the crypto bare market is if we were to see uh either Bitcoin or the total crypto market cap fall below the Ballinger band moving average on the monthly. I know you hear lots of analysts like looking at, I don't know, like the 50week uh simple moving average or whatever on Bitcoin or these different levels that literally everyone is watching. I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who's watching the Ballingerband moving average on the monthly. And again, I'm surprised by that because it has historically served as a pretty clear line in the sand as to what counts as a bull market versus a bare market. As a rule of thumb, when either the total crypto market cap or Bitcoin is above the Ballinger band moving average on the monthly, then crypto is in a bull market. And when it's below the Ballinger band moving average on the monthly, that means crypto is in a bare market. There's a couple interesting things to note in this regard. And the first is that this entire cycle both for the total crypto market cap and for Bitcoin, we actually didn't see a proper retest of the Ballinger band moving average on the monthly uh until basically uh November of last year. So from a purely technical perspective, like just being objective here, the pullback that we saw basically in October, November, even into December, the technically speaking, that was completely normal and something that was long overdue ever since crypto prices started breaking out in October of 2023, which is kind of crazy to wrap your head around. Um, the other thing to kind of point out here is that we're seeing a nice three stars in the south pattern here, which basically suggests, and you can even kind of see it with your naked eye that the selling pressure, the selling momentum has kind of been slowing over the last couple of months, we can see that prices, in this case, the total crypto market cap is holding quite snugly around 3 trillion. And so long as we do not see a big break below this key support level on the total crypto market cap or Bitcoin, then in my view, the crypto market can recover and we could actually see the crypto bull market continue. But of course, in the short term, this is on the monthly, but in the shorter term, we do have to take things one step at a time, especially if we're actively trading the markets. That's a perfect segue into what's happened over the last couple of days, so not surprisingly at all, both the crypto market and the stock market and global markets seem to have stabilized after Japanese bonds also stabilized. This is something I had pointed out over the weekend and also pointed out on Monday. I don't think that the pullback that we've seen over the last couple of days has anything to do with Greenland."

This is something I had pointed out over the weekend and also pointed out on Monday. I don't think that the pullback that we've seen over the last couple of days has anything to do with Greenland. Uh, and you can kind of see evidence in the fact that uh, over the last 24 hours, we've actually seen stuff around Greenland become even more like escalatory with like the Greenland prime minister saying a military invasion could happen and we need to prepare and whatever. But meanwhile, the markets have started calming down. And again, that's because the Japanese bonds have started calming down and that is really the main issue is that there's basically so much debt globally that we're starting to see strains in government bond markets. That's the real reason why we're seeing pressure on the markets. In my view, it has little to nothing to do with Greenland. Maybe that was like, you know, the kind of trigger that caused like a little bit of of panic, maybe like aggregate aggravated the situation, but it's not the underlying cause, if that makes any sense. Kind of like in crypto when you get a huge crash. Um, basically the kind of like the thing that's driving the crash is a huge long liquidation, but maybe there was like some catalyst out like a hotter than expected CPI or something that was the trigger. Um, but the actual underlying dynamics is something completely different. Uh, you know, in this case like a long liquidation or I guess specifically in this case that there's actually issues in the bond markets globally. The kind of silver lining there guys is that over the last couple of days we have seen the US dollar drop quite sharply. Yes, that is partially as a result of US markets uh investors supposedly pulling out of US markets. Although again I do think that's related to the dynamics with the yen. But regardless the point is that it's actually very good that we're seeing the uh the US dollar starting to drop here. So long as this drop continues then eventually that basically results in more uh global liquidity and that's exactly what we want to see. uh so long as the dollar continues dropping here, you know, in an orderly fashion, let's say like, you know, gradual fashion instead of a sharp drop, then we should see global liquidity improve and we should start to see uh assets continue to move higher, including crypto. This brings me to the short-term charts here. I kind of had to redraw the chart that I had originally drawn here for Bitcoin, like the one that I had here for Monday. Uh it was kind of like deleted or something. But anyway, as you can see, like things had kind of played out more or less as I had expected. The only caveat is that I was expecting a little bit of a bounce uh you know before we saw that leg lower, but I guess the leg lower just came anyway. That's no big deal because I do think that we finally found a bottom here. And the reason why I have this line drawn in the middle is to kind of point out that we're kind of seeing a mirror image of what we saw basically in November and December. What we're basically seeing here in in a longer term time frame is a large bottoming, a large accumulation pattern where if you guys have been paying attention to the headlines, you'll know that whales have been accumulating gradually in this range. obviously in preparation for another move higher for continuation. Uh again, you know, many people are watching 107,000. I personally think it'll be closer to 100,000 where the next key resistance is. But the point being is that what we've seen now for the last basically two or three months has been a big accumulation range with with onchain analysis suggesting that whales have been accumulating here."

But the point being is that what we've seen now for the last basically two or three months has been a big accumulation range with with onchain analysis suggesting that whales have been accumulating here. They've been accumulating Bitcoin and that suggests that we're going to get a get a continuation higher pro potentially into the end of January. Similar idea here with Ethereum where we did see again u maybe I'll even draw it out here just to make it a little bit clear. You know, nice little mirror image over the last couple of months in terms of what we've seen uh in uh in November and December. And that does suggest that this kind of bottom that we got here. Again, I was expecting a little bit of a bounce before that move lower. So, but you know, we got that move lower anyway. But in the next few days, we should see crypto prices bottom out and then a continuation higher in Ethereum, in Bitcoin, and the broader crypto market. And of course, I'm sure everyone's asking, \"Show me the catalyst. Show me the catalyst.\" Well, it's one that I've been repeating for a while now, guys, and it's the SEC's innovation exemption. This is something that's expected to happen by the end of the month. What it would basically do is temporarily legalize everything in the crypto market, especially onchain activity like DeFi, like tokenize RWAs, like Sociali. Um, you know, it would result, I think, in a lot of like big announcements. For example, like we could see social media companies announcing that they're going to launch stable coins. Uh maybe they're going to integrate with crypto projects and a whole bunch of different kind of like, you know, craziness you could say. Um, and uh, and I do see it kind of like as a plan B to the Clarity Act, which of course has been struggling, that if the Clarity Act isn't passed, then the SEC will come in with an innovation exemption to kind of like, you know, help the crypto industry, so to speak. Um, but, uh, another thing that's really interesting thing to me as well is I'm always thinking, guys, you know, like what are the kind of whales doing? What is what are the insiders doing? And it's interesting that Trump Media is going to airdrop its tokens at the beginning of February, I think on February 2nd. Uh, and that's really fascinating. I guess on February second or just after. And that's really interesting to me because of course when you combine that with the potential innovation exemption which would also, you know, allow things like airdrops, I think the timing is not necessarily a coincidence. And of course, I do think we're getting the Salana Seeker airdrop starting today. So with all these high-profile air drops coming in the next couple of weeks here and, you know, already starting now, I do think it's possible that the SEC's innovation exemption is coming sooner than later. And as soon as you know like the if the Japanese bond market can continue to behave. Uh I'm sure that this stuff around Greenland, I'm sure that that will also deescalate. You guys know Trump's strategy is to kind of like come out shock and awe then things scale back, especially when the markets start falling, Trump starts to scale back and then the markets continue powering higher. As a fun fact, even Scott Besson came out yesterday and he basically said, \"Hey, look guys, this is basically a repeat of the April 2025 tariff situation. You guys are all panicking. Uh the markets will be at all-time highs like very soon.\" Is literally what he said yesterday, you know. So, you know, we'll we'll have to see if if he's right on that prediction. But, of course, the other thing to watch here going into the end of the month will be at the sorry, the uh the Fed's uh January meeting here on January 28th."

But, of course, the other thing to watch here going into the end of the month will be at the sorry, the uh the Fed's uh January meeting here on January 28th. That's when they're going to announce uh their interest rate decision. And of course, that's tied in to the whole thing around uh Trump's tariffs, right, with this which the Supreme Court um is, you know, could potentially strike down. We're going to have to wait and see. Um but that's also going to be a big catalyst. Could that be bullish or bearish? It's going to be hard to tell. You know, I think it's still a little bit too soon to say. still depends on some incoming data. But the point is is that there are there do see seem to be a few catalysts here that would cause the crypto market to at least get a bounce here going into the end of the month. Whether that's going to be again like a lower high maybe up to around 95,000 and then a continuation lower again that's certainly possible. But again, the key level to watch here for cry for crypto for uh for Bitcoin is the Ballinger band moving average on the monthly. So long as that level holds, so long as we do not get a big breakdown below that level, the crypto bull market is still intact and the chances of of a rally or recovery or at least a bounce, I think are very high, especially with with this nice three stars in the south bottoming pattern suggesting a bullish reversal is coming sometime in February.
