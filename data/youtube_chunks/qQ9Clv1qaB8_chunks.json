      "text": "Good evening. On Friday, the Department \nof Justice served the Federal Reserve with   grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal \nindictment related to my testimony before the   Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony \nconcerned in part a multi-year project to renovate   historic Federal Reserve office buildings. I have deep respect for the rule of law and   for accountability in our democracy. No one, \ncertainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve,   is above the law. But this unprecedented \naction should be seen in the broader   context of the administration's threats \nand ongoing pressure. This new threat is   not about my testimony last June or about the \nrenovation. I know it doesn't feel like it,   but I can tell you that today is a very big day \non markets. I don't know if you guys know this,   but we see that Trump seems to have attacked \nPowell by this time serving potentially criminal   subpoenas against Chair Powell. And even though it \ndoesn't feel like it right now, this is a very big   day for markets. When we look at the charts today, \nthe markets haven't moved a lot, but let me assure   you that it's a very big day for markets and that \nthe markets should move on this news and that some   markets actually are moving on this news. I think \ntoday we need to look or we need to dive deeper   into what this is actually all about and how \nmarkets should actually play out about it. Today   has got a much more macro show because what's \nhappening today is much more macro but it does   have crypto implications and we should look at the \ncrypto implications and see why the markets aren't   moving or whether the markets will move going \nforward. Big show today. Let's get going guys. Shutterstock  So, I know it doesn't look like it or doesn't \nfeel like it when you look at the charts,   but it's a really big day for markets today. And \nwhat happened today is pretty much unprecedented. We're going to look deeper into what this is \nactually all about because as far as I know,   we've never had federal prosecutors going into a \nFed chair or basically investigating a Fed chair. So, what is this thing actually all about and \nhow is it all actually going to play out? That's   what we're going to be talking about today. Big \nshow today. If you're not already subscribed,   subscribe to the channel. If you are subscribed, \ndo me a favor, smash the like button. It really   helps with distribution and we work really \nhard. Even though the crypto market isn't   really firing a lot, it makes us work much \nharder to actually bring you guys the fresh   content every single day. Today we're going \nto dig into some really fresh content. So   what is this all about and where does this \nwhole thing actually start? As you can see,   federal prosecutors opened an inquiry into \nFed Chair Powell. That headline came out   on the 12th of January 2026. But that's \nnot the whole story. If you look here,   it says the US attorney's office in District \nof Columbia opened a criminal investigation   into Fed Chair Powell over the central bank's \nrenovation of its Washington headquarters. Now   it's not really about the Washington headquarters, \nright? It's much more around Powell. And I want to   show you exactly where this stems from. You will \nremember that Powell was testifying in front of   the Senate Banking Panel in June 2025. Last year \nin June 2025, Powell was testifying in front of   the Senate and this question actually came up. I \ndid want to touch on one item that the chairman   mentioned and I think it's important. I know that \nyou didn't mention it in your opening statement,   but would you talk a little bit about just \nexactly what's going on with your building   when you have that type of an overrun on the \nprices and you're talking about billions of   dollars in costs? I think it's appropriate \nfor you to be able to explain to the committee   exactly what's going on. Would you take a few \nminutes, please, and explain what's going on? The history is that the Fed is renovating their \nbuilding or a series of buildings. In June 2025,   Powell was prodded around the renovation of the \nbuilding and the fact that it was then blown up   by the media to be portrayed to be a very lavish \nrenovation of this building which was running   overtime and over budget. Listen to this. The \nvalue of that building and why the cost seems   to be so exorbitant. I'd be glad to if I can \nhave that time. Please thank you for the letter   we received late yesterday."

Listen to this. The value of that building and why the cost seems to be so exorbitant. I'd be glad to if I can have that time. Please thank you for the letter we received late yesterday. We will provide a \nmuch more detailed response, but just generally   I would just say we do take seriously our \nresponsibility as stewards of the public's   money. And the other thing I would start with is \nno one in office wants to do a major renovation of   a historic building during their term in office. Much prefer to leave that to your successors. And this is a great example why. Let alone two \nhistoric buildings that needed a lot of work. But we decided to take it on because honestly when \nI was the administrative governor before I became   chair, I came to understand how badly the Eckles \nbuilding really needed a serious renovation. It   never had one. It was not really safe and it was \nnot waterproof and that kind of thing. So we took   it on. I would also say that the media reports \nthat you accurately quoted, they're misleading and   inaccurate in many respects. I would just point to \nthere's no VIP dining room. There's no new marble. We took down the old marble. We're putting it back \nup. We'll have to use new marble where some of the   old marble broke, but there's no new elevators. Old elevators in there. There are no new water   features. There's no beehives and there's no \nroof terrace gardens. Other than that, all of   the inflammatory things that the media carried are \neither not in the current plan or just inaccurate. Notwithstanding that, the cost overruns are \nwhat they are. So, let me just say on that,   well, let's we're well over the five minute mark. I'm happy to give you time to talk about that. Get this. What happened is that the media \npublished an article not long before this   testimony where they accused the Fed of having \na massive building upgrade in very tough times   and that they talked about a new marble, \nbeehives, VIP lounges, big elevators etc. What Powell says here is that they denied \nit. He's basically denying saying, \"Look,   this is not a lavish upgrade. It's just a normal \nupgrade which we pretty much needed to do.\" Now,   note that this is in a 2-hour testimony. This is \nin minute 21. Note how the chairman, Mr. Scott,   already has this information, which means \nthat when they came here, they were prepared   to talk about this building upgrade. That's \na very important bit of information because   I'll show you how that all fits into the puzzle. The one senator actually brought it up and now   you'll see how the other senator basically has the \ninformation and starts prodding Powell and knows a   lot about what there is and what there isn't and \nwhere there are overruns and where there are not   overruns. Which means that before they got to this \ntestimony, they knew and they planned that they   were going to prod Powell about the building \noverruns and effectively to try and trap him. Listen to this. This is 9 minutes later in the \nsame testimony. The Fed for the construction and   you said that the items that were listed are \nnot happening. I will say that the National   Capital Planning Commission website ncpc.gov. Anyone can take a look at it for themselves. Not just looking or listening to the New \nYork Post, not just the Wall Street Journal,   but page 129 of the final plans reflected rooftop \ngarden terraces. Page 127 and 129 were where we   found the ornate water features in final plans. The new elevators that dropped board members   off at the VIP dining suite was page 37 of the \nfinal plans. The white marble was pages 40, 41,   65 of final plans."

The white marble was pages 40, 41, 65 of final plans. I would welcome your staff \ncoming in to walk my staff through what is   happening there as opposed to what we have only \nread in the New York Post, not only in the Wall   Street Journal, but also at the National Capital \nPlanning Commission's website. We would welcome   that opportunity. Can I just quickly say some \nof those are just flatly misleading. The idea   of elevators? It's the same elevator. It's been \nthere since the building was built. So that's a   mischaracterization. And some of those are no \nlonger in the plans. The plans have continued   to evolve. And one of the questions I asked my \nstaff before having the conversation with you   in preparation and assuming that your response \nwould be to refute some of the things that were   happening was to ask the question, well since the \narticles came out in April, have the plans changed   since April as a result of the media attention \nto it or was that just never in the plan? I   would just say that having an understanding, \na clear understanding of what's going to be   and when it changed would be helpful for us. I \nwill note that having confidence in what we hear   is incredibly important and I would give you the \nopportunity to bring your team in or send your   team over so that we can have that conversation. That would be helpful. Look forward to doing that. Remember that Powell is under oath here and that \nhe has to answer this honestly and truthfully and   if not then he can go to jail because of perjury. It's a criminal offense. And if you'll allow me   to say one more sentence, none of those things \nare really the cost drivers. You know the real   thing is what were the cost drivers that caused \nthe spending to increase and we have those too,   but those are not the things that did that. Well, \nwe look forward to the conversation. Remember that   when Powell was here and he was testifying in \nfront of the Senate committee, he was doing it   under oath. When you're under oath, you have to \nanswer honestly, truthfully, and correctly. You   can see that they caught him off guard here and \nhe said, \"Look, I'm not sure there are elevators,   etc.\" And then what happened was Scott and Trump \nvisited the Fed building to see the renovations. I   don't know if you guys remember this, but this \nis quite an iconic clip and an iconic moment. So, we're taking a look and it looks like \nit's about 3.1 billion. It went up a little   bit or a lot. So, the 2.7 is now 3.1. I'm not \naware of the? Yeah, it just came out. Yeah,   I haven't heard that from anybody. It just \ncame out. I know about 3.1 as well. 3.1,   3.2. This came from us. Yes. I don't know \nwho does that. You're including the market   renovation. You just added your entire capital. You just added in a third building is what that   is. That's a third building. No, but it's a \nbuilding that's being built. No, it was built. So, this was the whole squabble around the \nwhole renovation. And the whole thing about   this thing is that it's actually not about the \nrenovation and overrunning on the renovation   because they're not actually accusing Powell of \nfraud or maybe appointing his own contractors or   building his own house. All they're getting him \nhere is about the fact that he was dishonest in   his testimony under oath. And that is effectively \nperjury. And perjury in the US is effectively a   criminal offense. And that is all they're going \nafter Powell for. So now you got to ask yourself,   what the rubbish is actually going on here? I \nthink what we need to pay attention to is the   following."

And that is all they're going after Powell for. So now you got to ask yourself, what the rubbish is actually going on here? I think what we need to pay attention to is the following. Up until now, we know that Powell \nand Trump have a very strained relationship. Trump has always been pretty vocal and pretty \nabusive around Powell, calling him \"too late   Powell,\" saying that he's a bad central banker \nand really trying to pressure him or trying to   bully him into reducing rates. That is how the \nrelationship's been. And up until now, even   though Trump has been vocal and he's threatened \nhim with passive aggressiveness, he said, \"Look,   Powell's reappointment to the Federal Reserve \nmight be nullified because it was instituted   by Biden's autopin even though actually Trump \nwas the one who actually nominated Powell for   the Federal Reserve job.\" He said by the end \nof the year, we want to get too late Powell   out. We want to be early, etc. Up until now, what \nyou've seen is that Powell has always been very   professional and he's always really exercised \nrestraint in how he deals with President Trump. But that changed yesterday because yesterday \nbefore the news headlines actually came out   is when Powell came out with this statement. I think we need to listen to the statement   quickly because it's well worth listening to the \nstatement and where he gets quite aggressive. On Friday, the Department of Justice served the \nFederal Reserve with grand juries. The first thing   we need to understand is that this came out they \nwere served with these subpoenas on Friday and   this video and the news only came out on Sunday \nwhich means that during the weekend Powell and   his advisors said look we received these criminal \nsubpoenas or these subpoenas which usually preempt   criminal action and we need to know what to \ndo and they realized that the best course of   action would be for them to actually publicize \nit before the president actually publicizes   subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment \nrelated to my testimony before the Senate Banking   Committee last June. That testimony concerned in \npart a multi-year project to renovate historic   Federal Reserve office buildings. I have \ndeep respect for the rule of law and for   accountability in our democracy. No one, certainly \nnot the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the   law. But this unprecedented action should be seen \nin the broader context of the administration's   threats and ongoing pressure. This new threat \nis not about my testimony last June or about the   renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It \nis not about Congress's oversight role. The Fed,   through testimony and other public disclosures, \nmade every effort to keep Congress informed about   the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The \nthreat of criminal charges is a consequence of the   Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on \nour best assessment of what will serve the public. This is now where Powell is accusing Trump of \nsaying you're coming after me because I'm not   listening to you in terms of policy. And this \nis a direct push back from Powell. Up until   now Powell's been very calculated and very \nprofessional. But now he's basically coming   out and saying, \"You're going after me because I \nrefuse to lower interest rates.\" Powell published   this first because he wants the world to know \nthis rather than following the preferences of   the president. This is about whether the Fed will \nbe able to continue to set interest rates based   on evidence and economic conditions. This \nis about the future of the Fed and whether   the Fed can remain independent of politics. Instead, monetary policy will be directed by   political pressure or intimidation. I have served \nat the Federal Reserve under four administrations,   Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I \nhave carried out my duties without political fear   or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price \nstability and maximum employment. Public service   sometimes requires standing firm in the face \nof threats."

Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the   Senate confirmed me to do with integrity and \na commitment to serving the American people. So, let's look at what's actually going on here. This is the first time that Powell's actually come   out and been vocal and been confrontational with \nPresident Trump. And he's basically saying, look,   I am not going to be intimidated by these tactics \nand your tactics are actually about trying to   influence interest rates. To be honest, even if \nhe did perjure about something so small, that's   not really important. This is about the fact that \nPowell wouldn't reduce rates and Trump's upset and   Trump's basically going after Powell. Now, you got \nto ask yourself the next question. We know that in   May this year, which is four months away, we know \nthat a new Fed chair is appointed. And that new   Fed chair is appointed by Trump. So you kind of \nwant to ask yourself why is this happening right   now? Why what what do they actually want from \nPowell? Surely they're not doing this to pressure   him to reducing rates because four months before \nhe's about to leave and with probably two or three   Fed chair meetings to go, this is not really a \ngood tactic. But what I was reading here is that   actually even though the Fed chair term ends on \nthe 15th of May 2026, his term as governor only   ends in January 31st 2028, which means that \neven though he won't be the chair of the Fed,   he'll still be a governor at the Fed until 2028. A \ngovernor still has a lot of votes. He'd still vote   on interest rates at the FOMC meetings. He still \nhas a lot of influence. He'd still be influencing   policy direction. And the thing around Powell's \ninfluence is that if you look at the approval   ratings, actually Powell's got the highest \napproval rating out of any political leader in   the country, even higher than Donald Trump. He's \ngot a 44 percent approval rating. He's still very   influential. I think what Trump wants to do is \nthat Trump wants him to get out before the end   of his term or at least at the end of his term. He doesn't want him to stay there until 2028. Now this is a big why did I say it's a big day \nfor markets? Because this is actually pretty   scary. In the US, the one thing about the Fed, \nthe Fed is supposed to be independent. The Fed   is not supposed to be a political tool and it \nis supposed to be nonpartisan. It is supposed   to be a body that operates independently \nof the president. As Coffeezilla says here,   \"Absolutely extraordinary moment. Whether you \nlike the Fed or not, their independence is one   of the central features of the United States. If they become a puppet of the executive office,   we could be seeing interest rates go very low.\" That's exactly the logical explanation here. For 113 years, Fed chairs could defy presidents \nwithout facing prosecutions. But on January 9th,   it ended because Powell said that the DOJ's probe \nthreatens the Fed's independence and is directly   linked to his refusal to follow through on Trump's \ninterest rate demands. Senator Thom Tillis says if   there was any remaining doubt as to whether \nadvisers within the Trump administration are   actively pushing to end the independence of the \nFederal Reserve, there should be none. Now it is   the independence and credibility of Department of \nJustice that are in question. So he's basically   saying that Trump is trying to influence the \nFed. Now the question is what will happen at   the Department of Justice? Lastly, Henrik Zeberg \nsays the Fed is terribly late but decisions and   actions must remain out of the control of the \nexecutive branch and Congress."

Now the question is what will happen at the Department of Justice? Lastly, Henrik Zeberg says the Fed is terribly late but decisions and actions must remain out of the control of the executive branch and Congress. This is the only   thing which prevents everything from running a \nmock. If markets begin to believe that the US   administration just prints whatever it needs, the \nUS monetary regime collapses. So disagreeing with   the Fed is fine, but putting legal pressure \nto cut rates is not the best way forward. This is exactly why Bitcoin was created. The \nreason why I say that is because if the US   president can unilaterally control the printing \nof the dollar and the policies that control the   movement of the dollar by influencing the Fed, \nthen it means that the US is not as strong as   it is and that it is effectively a kink in \nthe armor of the US. So what you would expect   and what we all expected this morning as Will \nClemente says, \"This environment is literally   what Bitcoin was created for. The president \nis going after the Fed, metals are ripping,   sovereigns diversify reserves, stock and risk \nassets at record all-time highs. Geopolitical risk   rising. If Bitcoin can't catch a bid then I don't \nknow.\" What actually happened this morning? Well,   the first thing is actually Bitcoin did \ncatch a bid but only for a couple of hours. Bitcoin went to about 92,000. Why? Because again, \nthis is exactly what Bitcoin was created for. But   then let's look at some of the other charts. The \nfirst thing is that the DXY weakened by about half   a percent. That doesn't sound like a big drop, but \nwhen the DXY weakens by half a percent, that is   actually quite a big and quite an unprecedented \ndrop. That just shows that what the world is   basically saying is we trust the US dollar because \nof the independence of the Fed. If President Trump   is going to interfere here and if there is a \nchance that the Fed is not independent, then   that's quite a big thing. But then we look at some \nof the other precious metals and you can see that   what happened was gold went to all-time highs, \nsilver went to all-time highs, copper went to   all-time highs on this announcement. The one thing \nthat didn't actually run was actually Bitcoin. Now, you got to ask yourself a whole lot of \nquestions as to why that's actually happening   because this is the very reason why Bitcoin was \ncreated. The whole thing about Bitcoin is that   Bitcoin was created to protect you or to give you \nsound money that is not reliant on governments. As governments seem to be interfering with their \ncurrencies, then logically we would expect that   that would be the ideal time for Bitcoin and \nit wasn't. And the same thing when you look at   US equity markets, you would expect that if this \nis what's going on in the US that the US equity   markets and the futures would absolutely collapse. And the truth is they didn't actually collapse. So all we're seeing now is that the market is \nquite apathetic towards this funnily enough. And they're not panicking in any way about this. I'm not sure if it is that they're not taking this   very seriously or I'm not really sure the reason \nwhy. But what I can tell you is that ultimately   all this is doing is pushing more fire into the \ncommodity super cycle which is basically going on. I want to spend a little bit of time \ntalking about the commodity super cycle   because if I look at the commodities, what I \ncan see is that silver is up in the last one   year 170 percent, platinum's up another 140 \npercent, palladium's up 95 percent, gold's   up 66 percent, copper's up 38 percent, and the \nS&P is up 34 and 22 percent."

And what I thought   about you is I'm like we are here in crypto and \nwe are supposed to be getting these massive runs   and this massive bull market and what I'm seeing \nthat is playing out is like if you look at gold,   gold is acting like Bitcoin and if you look at \nsilver and you look at all the other commodities   they're pretty much acting like the altcoins \nand what seems to be happening is that we seem   to be having a Bitcoin altcoin market flow. It \nseems like the same thing's actually happening   in commodities so whilst nothing is happening \nin the crypto markets and we've been between   88 and 95 for the last two or three months what \nis actually happening in commodities is exactly   what we'd expect in our markets. Gold has gone \nup like 40 percent or 60 percent. In a period   where gold's gone up 60 percent, silver's gone up \n200 percent to 170 percent. Doesn't that remind   you of if Bitcoin goes up 66 percent, you'd \nkind of expect ETH in the old days to go up   200 percent? And then you can see that all the \nother commodities have started to run. You had   platinum up 140 percent, you had palladium up, \nyou've got copper, which is absolutely ripping. There's a reason why I want to show you \nthis. Just look at the CFDs on copper. From the bottom of October 23 to today, copper is \nup 70 percent. Why am I telling you this? Because   we know how market cycles play out. We know that \nthey go from the safe asset to the slightly less   safe asset to the highly speculative assets \nas the flow happens. It feels to me like the   same thing's happening in commodities right now. Commodities seem to have found the ultimate bid. What is that bid? That bid is about number one \nthe real store of value, the traditional store   of value. Gold is the traditional store of value \nand that has been running for a while. Straight   after that had run for a while and the commodity \nmarket got confidence then silver started running. That was like the ETH and then after that all \nthe other ones started to run. You're getting   the ultimate play here. Why? Because you've got \nthe risk diversification play where the big money   is allocated to the safest asset and then once \nthe safest asset shows confidence in the market   then the money started flowing into the more \nspeculative commodities assets and that's where   the big returns are coming in and now the returns \nare starting to move to things like uranium and   copper and whatever else and ultimately what I'm \nstarting to see is I'm starting to see a super   cycle happening in the commodities. I've obviously \nbeen part of this cycle, but what I didn't realize   is that we may be getting the ultimate cycle \nhere. Why? Because it's the combination of a   speculative trade and the fact that we actually \nneed in the new age, in the age of AI and in   the age of data centers and everything, \nyou actually do need these commodities. Just listen to what Chamath actually said \nhere. Business winner for 2026 after yourself. I will pick copper. We are still completely \nunderestimating how short we are in terms of   the global demand supply dynamics of a handful \nof critical elements that we need again in the   Trump doctrine view of the world that is no \nlonger as multilateral as it was and we need   to have unilateral national security. If you look \nthrough that lens, the asset that is set up to go   absolutely parabolic is copper. The reason is \nthat it is the most useful, cheap, amendable,   conductive material that we have. That material \nmanifests in everything from our data centers   to our chips to our weapon systems."

That material manifests in everything from our data centers to our chips to our weapon systems. It's just \neverywhere. And right now, what you're seeing   is you're seeing that these assets that actually \nhave real use cases and we need them in AI and   data centers and drones and whatever else have \nactually really found a bid. At the same time,   this is when people are flocking to the store \nof value. So, you've almost got the Bitcoin of   commodities, which is gold, shooting up. Bitcoin \nseems to have slowed down or topped and now the   flow of money is starting to flow down. There's a \nlot of money to be made in these things. Actually,   I noticed that some influencers that used \nto make crypto content, like Ben Cowen,   for example, is starting to make content \non uranium. Is uranium a good long-term   investment? Which is quite surprising, \nbut ultimately that's what's going on. He says gold and silver just happening at new \nall-time highs. I can't find uranium on Coinbase. The truth is that there are opportunities to \nactually make money. And the truth is for us,   the good thing is that we can actually make \nmoney using our crypto money whilst the crypto   markets aren't moving. We can trade on crypto \nexchanges, use our crypto assets to actually trade   commodities. I don't know if you guys know \nthis, but for example, if you look at one   of our partners which is Blofin, did you know \nthat you can trade gold on leverage on Blofin? You can also trade silver. You can actually \nalso trade silver on leverage on Bitget and   on Blofin. You can trade copper on leverage on \nthese exchanges. Also, when it comes to the bots,   Pionex has got gold bots, silver bots, etc. So, just wanted to show you that you know what,   there is always a bull market somewhere. Right \nnow the crypto markets seem to be quite boring   and not much happening. And that has to play out \nin time. In fact, it has to play out very soon. Until then, there is a super cycle actually \nhappening and it's happening in commodities   and we can trade our commodities using \nthe normal exchanges that we use. If   you want to sign up and you want to trade these \ncommodities, just go to the bottom of the video. There should be signup links here for Blofin \nwhere you can actually trade commodities and   also all three of these exchanges. We'll put \nactually links to the actual commodities here. You can sign up and trade commodities and \neach one of these exchanges has an offer. I think for now this Powell under attack \nthing, the market seems to be brushing it   off as something of a nothing burger. I think \nthat the market just wants Powell out at the   moment and they want just Trump to get his way \nand I don't think that there's a real risk but   in the meantime the commodity super cycle is \ncontinuing and we can trade the commodity super   cycle basically using our crypto dollars. Great. I think that's it for today. Let me know what   you think in the comments. Otherwise, see you \nguys again tomorrow. Don't forget if you want   to go and trade them. I actually bought quite \na bit of copper this morning. $300,000 worth of   copper or something this morning on leverage on \nthe exchange. But yeah, you go and have a look. I'll put the links below. We'll change in a few \nseconds so that you can actually see the actual   links where you can actually go and trade. See you \nguys later. Until then, trade well, my friends."
