      "text": "squad. It has been a couple of days uh for me. Market's looking a little bit shaky. I do want to speak around it's turning bearish pretty fast. But I think the very important thing in today's show is are we going and going to hold $80,000 on Bitcoin bearish or are we going to go to $65,000 bearish? Right. I can hear myself here. Uh there we go. 65 $70,000. Right, that's the big question over here. So for me, we have lost a very important trend that I would like to see us reclaim and I'll show you guys this trend over here, right? Very important, okay, for us to reclaim. Otherwise, we are very much over the next few days going back into bearish momentum. But the very important thing is we have a strong level on the weekly and that is the previous bounce zone. And if we lose that, we need to really start wrapping our heads around three, six months of crazy bare chopped down. Now, this is not a negative. This just means that we have to look at what strategy can we make money if that basically happens. And again, for me, the important thing is is while we're waiting for this market to make its mind up, right? It just looks really confused. It looks like every pump is not trusted. a lot of these uh you know volume is quite low and I think for me we can use this time to really play out specifically in this show go through the very big bearish scenario right as well as what do we need to do to get bullish but I think we've worked a lot on bullish strategies we need to focus very much on how we're going to make money if this market turns bearish because it just means we need to play the market for what it is and it's crazy because stock markets and Many commodities and different things are rocketing, right? Absolutely flying. Is crypto lagging behind or are we just in a long-term bare cycle? Right? Again, every few days market will temporary turn bullish. It will turn bearish. But it's very important for us to just really nail down the strategies that this year we are here to make money. Okay? and the cycles have kind of shifted and changed and the main goal this year is to recover and make a lot of damn money and get very smart within the game, right? Does this mean sometimes we'll move to some stocks? We'll move back to crypto. We'll get into shorting strategies. There are many different things to chat about. So, this is going to be a nice strong stream where I'm going to update a lot of short-term stuff. Let's go through the alts. Alts are looking weak, right? Some of them are looking okay. Um, let's go through all the short-term uh uh time frames, but let's also go through the higher time frames and just speak around strategies and game plans and really just make sure we are prepared for either way that this market wants to go. So guys, I missed you all. Thank you for all the love. It has been a I just started getting momentum, just getting excited with shows and then ended up in hospital, but I'm in my house for the next couple of days. Um, out of hospital, been in bed quite a bit. So, I'm going to be streaming at home, but I'm glad to see you all. So, no more wasting time. Let's go. >> I try and fight the devils, but inside I'm just like sniper. >> Yes, fam. How are we doing? Brand new to the channel. Hit the subscribe button and like the video up just for one reason. You ain't going to quit. You're going to keep showing up, right? That's the important thing. Now, my energy is going to be here, but lower. I don't want to crack a rope or or trigger my chest pains. Quick update on that. Had two collapses in the last 14 days. Collapse to the floor. Massive pains in the ribs and the chest, in the back as well. Um to a point where I eventually had to go to to hospital. Um they then destroyed me with meds. um kind of felt like it wasn't even about the problem anymore. It was just about like dose this man up, right? So, it was a lot of sleeping every day and just completely out of it."

Had two collapses in the last 14 days. Collapse to the floor. Massive pains in the ribs and the chest, in the back as well. Um to a point where I eventually had to go to to hospital. Um they then destroyed me with meds. um kind of felt like it wasn't even about the problem anymore. It was just about like dose this man up, right? So, it was a lot of sleeping every day and just completely out of it. Um kind of got over hospital because it felt like it was just uh uh like I said, just a drugging kind of system, just like pumping with meds all the time, but when I wake up, there's still pain. So, we weren't really fixing the pain so much. Um but was zonking me out. um and uh got myself out of hospital, s myself out at MI. And I've been focusing very much this week on seeing specialists and trying to get down to the problem. And it's quite it's quite crazy. Um and I'm pretty sure a lot of us can resonate with this in life and trading as well. I started making really good healthier decisions four weeks ago, right? I started making all the shifts and it's crazy how when I shifted everything, how like resistance slammed me, right? just started getting everything back on track and excited and things shifting and then all of a sudden here comes a big major block and it kind of feels like trading too, right? Trading just starts it just starts slowly getting back up and then again we have a ugly dump over the last few days. Um we just got a crack through the resistance. That's the very important thing. But gotten a lot of love. Thank you guys so much. I'm good. Gonna keep pushing and for me still going to be the best year yet. Now let's go through a couple of things. So few things to go through within the show is to really just speak around when do we get out of this bare market, right? Because a bare market doesn't necessarily just mean down. It just means that pumps are not trusted. It just means we range for a while. Um and there's just not much certainty, right? Not a lot of people flying into crypto. Many projects are losing money, right? Many exchanges are losing money. It's a very tough environment. And that for me is a bare market, right? It's just when we we've lost 90% of the audience, right? And we're not just talking audience. We're just talking users on all platforms. We're talking many different places. Now, those audiences are not gone. They're kind of moving to other spots at this point, but we are at that sentiment kind of low. And for me, a lot has to be proven for that to to come back. Now, the key is to not kind of come back when everyone's coming back, right? But it is important to kind of know when will people start to to come back, right? And it's also important to know like firstly how long we're going to be here and is the low in on Bitcoin, right? That's the big thing. Now the next realization and I'm I'm going to go through this in a sec, but I'm going to possibly make a big pivot and I think it might be a little bit late some will say because I've been four or five years trading altcoins and things like that, but for me things are never late. You know, things kind of align. There was always strengths of trading altcoins. There was always strengths of doing these things. Um but for me it was okay instead of paying so much attention to altcoins and specifically Bitcoin, right? The the key chart is just paying attention to very big levels on the Bitcoin dominance, right? And until we are very certain or break a very key level on the high time frame Bitcoin dominance, your best bet is probably to trade Bitcoin. And this is coming from someone that is obsessed with altcoins, right? And I'm obsessed because I've seen what they've done before and they did give me an opportunity to change my life, right?"

And this is coming from someone that is obsessed with altcoins, right? And I'm obsessed because I've seen what they've done before and they did give me an opportunity to change my life, right? But I've also seen that they are becoming one of the biggest destroyers in not specifically trading uh trading and investing, right? They're becoming a very big downside risk as well. And this is a very big thing to finally kind of pay attention to. Um I've been spending a lot of time with a lot of entrepreneurs. I got a lot of groups outside specifically when one main group outside of crypto this world and it's a entrepreneur group that I spend time with guys that have run businesses and I think the number one thing that we've said many times and stuff but protecting downside and managing risk is probably one of the hardest things and probably the most important thing right when it comes to growing money and things like that we have our times but it's the downside and for me there's so much hope and you know experience in alt seasons and alt runs before that there's a part of me that will still believe that it will always be there but I got to really understand that when it comes to me holding money and making money I've managed to do at times but losing it's becoming incredibly easy these days I need to really just pay attention to a longevity strategy right and a longevity play of me really protecting downside as much as possible. And if we look at probably the best asset, right, which is Bitcoin in the crypto market, it hasn't been performing as in gold and silver and these things. It has done very well over the last two years or so. We're still like 4x from the lows or 5x from the lows. Um, but ultimately the downside is so much less stressful. Um, but the growth is a lot less too. Now what that means for me is yes it moves slower doesn't mean you can't make as much but for me the downside thing is attracting me very much and it's quite sad because if I look at my portfolio 80% down let's say or even just net worth in general 80 70% down um again this is on a very bad market we'll see when things turn but the truth of the matter is looking at that might see it a little bit late but the important thing here is the long-term game of I'm 100% confident every single one of you and myself stay dedicated and stay in the markets. Doesn't mean just crypto anymore. We might shift a little bit um but we keep going. We will recover, right? But I don't want to go through this downside anymore. I don't want to go through these cycles of 10 times in your net worth and then losing 70% of it. um spending time in hospital, spending time in bed has made me like really realize that I suppose it's maturing. I've came into this game quite young, right? And I'm this optimistic I can't think red and I can't think these things. And I'm sure a lot of people in the comments here and let me know if you're very similar. Um can't think these things. And you know, and it's just so important to know that downside risk and diversifying and these things are the ultimate skill to to wealth, you know, and at some point you got to admit it. Um, zero zero regrets, nothing, right? There's parts that are upset and stuff like that, but you can't complain how you got here, right?"

Um, zero zero regrets, nothing, right? There's parts that are upset and stuff like that, but you can't complain how you got here, right? you got you because of where things worked and didn't work and who you met and who you didn't meet and where you lost and where you made right so you can't really fight with with there because I think we can all be grateful that we we living and we we we here right um but I think there is a certain point where it's like okay it's time to now like really look and and and listen so I'm going to really focus specifically over this next period on learning Bitcoin trading Bitcoin maybe short-term, midterm, um not so much long-term, long-term I've always been accumulating Bitcoin. Um but to really just get it back to basics and back to basics is trading one coin for a while, right? Because the alts are so incredible to the upside and and it hurts that we haven't seen the crazy run yet. And I got a lot of cool charts that I want to show you guys. Um but the downside is just ridiculous, right? And just the way the I wouldn't say manipulation but whatever the hell it is it's just it's not the dream of what us all alcoin believers have been waiting for. There are times where altcoins are going to absolutely rocket to the upside. But that shouldn't be the the main reason of getting rich. that can be 20% of it, right? And I always believe there will be a part there, but there should be something else that gets you rich, right? And I think for me it's it's that sense of like, okay, like let's build a long-term skill over the next few months and let's narrow down back to basics and let's get really good at one coin. There's liquidity there. It's probably the strongest asset to the downside, right? A little bit slower to to the upside, but we can work with that. We can we can strategize a little bit more. So, for any people that are kind of feeling I'm just having a quick quick chat with you guys. It's been a while. Um, the sense of like really just stuckness and losing absolute belief in things. I don't think this is the end. I think it's just a reboot button for us to all hit and to really get back to the basics again. One coin, simple setups, learn to accelerate fast to the upside, and learn to lose a lot less to the downside. Um, and when it comes to alcoins, I will still hold alcoins for the long term and I'll still be a believer. But, and again, this is not to say that this is the strategy, right? This is just to say that this is the route that I'm going to attempt. If I want to make a dramatic change because the last it was so weird. I I was speaking to a bunch of friends and the business buddies like last year was there was two months in the year where I was my highest net worth and there was two months where I was my lowest net worth, right? And it it's it's just crazy in one year you can see your highest highs and your high and your lowest lows in one year. And that for me is just I'm tired of that, you know? I'm really getting tired because you you you you feel safe and then you feel unsafe. So what this creates over time is just completely unsafety, right? There's no safety because you never know if it's going to last. Um, and when the emotions are green and things are really good, you tend to not like diversify, take enough profits, all these type of things. Um, and then when things are red, you obviously regret every single one of those decisions."

Um, and then when things are red, you obviously regret every single one of those decisions. Um, so I need to make a big change. I need to bring this new version of Sheldon. You know, I'm coming I'm about I'm going to turn 30 this year. Um I'm proud of the journey. There's a lot of goods and and not wrongs but lessons that I've learned on this thing. But I think a big pivot is like trade the best asset now. Focus on downside more and focus on strategies to build your money up but start building something way more sustainable. Start maturing in these things and don't regret a single amount of money that was lost or any of these type of things because that's what gave you the experience to where you are today. And I'm pretty sure we're going to put it to a test, but there's going to be a lot of me now attempting full-on Bitcoin altcoins, which is going to be weird, right? But I'm pretty sure all the hard work of learning to chart and trade the volatility on altcoins, plus doing leverage, plus doing all these different things, I'm pretty sure this is going to make trading Bitcoin easier. that experience is going to come into play because I feel like we went to level hard before we played easy. Well, easier, right? And easier is just not losing as much money when when bad streaks kind of come down and these things as well. So, I do think all that experience is a big role. So, for me, just letting you guys know that this is the time to clamp down. It's a time to work harder. It's a time to not lose your faith. Feel every single one of them, right? You're breathing. You're living. Feel your faith. feel your conviction and let's make some big pivots and by the end of the year let's make sure we've made a lot of money but let's make sure we're just so smart at protecting that money and you know and not losing it so much anymore and these type of things um and it's very hard after losses and you kind of get humbled but you know we got this we got this we absolutely got this so let's jump in let's go okay let's jump through a couple things so Quick thing is just a couple of high time frame importance. Um for me, we are in bare markets and again bare markets is not just downside, it's just no interest type of areas, right? So we're going to need to really break key structures and levels to bring interest back specifically when it comes to the bullish side, right? Um yeah, I've been honest, but I've also and I appreciate that. Thank you. Um, a lot of respect and love to you guys. Um, but there's also times where it's just like, you know, make the shifts. And I hope you guys have learned from mistakes, too. My goal was not here la last last little chat. Last little chat. Last little chat. My goal here was to not always be perfect. I'm going to be step one in some people's journey. I'm going to be step one to 100 in some people's journey. Some will be with me in this entire journey, right?"

I'm going to be step one in some people's journey. I'm going to be step one to 100 in some people's journey. Some will be with me in this entire journey, right? Some will come in and we struggling with alts and I'm taking a couple losses and they end up sitting and taking one or two let's say losses from what they've learned and things like that and then they're like okay screw this Sheldon guy and they go watch Benjamin Cowan as an example and they start Bitcoin and they ended up making a success like amazing I was step one I didn't have to be step 100 right but I was someone that was there that came in and these type of things as well so this is why the honesty And that's quite important. And then there's those that will be with me in my journey and they know the volatility and my goal now is to way more less volatile income, volatile Sheldon, volatile mentally. Like no more volatility anymore. Like let's grow more steady, more slowly. Like I I've done my hours. I've done my my my time in that. Um and those are those people that resonate to that that know that life ain't that easy all the time, you know, but we've survived. We've been at rock bottom many times. we've gotten through in these type of things. Um, so the big thing here is to be to open and honest uh of where we at. But uh for me it's it's a journey, right? Been here since 2023. Incredible. Amazing. Guys, pop in the chats when when have you been here? Since when? Just let me know. Would you just want to have a look? Okay, so two very important lines just to pay attention to. And I'm actually going to pop to this chart and just put them in quick. um is the line of the kind of last support until we start really thinking of you know 60,000 70,000s right so this line over here um most touched trend for me you know this is why we're in a tough market because we're sitting between two of these lines right the one was when Bitcoin started to speed up um towards the mid 2024 right I think it was when uh Trump and all that came through we did start to speed quite aggressively range definitely started to pick up um quite a bit but when we obviously lost that now in November we stuck between these two right and that's why this market is going up hitting resistance coming down going up during this and it's purely a range where it's just they're not lasting too long right pumps are not trusted dumps are getting bought up right we see an exchange of hands happen quite a bit so that's that trend there that one's at the most relevant don't run one right now, but that is what's kind of holding the growth at this point is there. But the big thing to pay attention to is obviously this over here, right, which is the the bottom trend here. Anything below this trend, right, we do start looking at going to test supports. Now, again, this isn't it's over for Bitcoin, but it is a honesty view of, you know, are we going to go to 65? Um because when we did see bear, there was two legs down, right?"

      "text": "why this market is going up hitting resistance coming down going up during this and it's purely a range where it's just they're not lasting too long right pumps are not trusted dumps are getting bought up right we see an exchange of hands happen quite a bit so that's that trend there that one's at the most relevant don't run one right now, but that is what's kind of holding the growth at this point is there.

Now, again, this isn't it's over for Bitcoin, but it is a honesty view of, you know, are we going to go to 65? Um because when we did see bear, there was two legs down, right? And if this is the bare right there's phases of bare but there is the downside phases too but this was the first drop right and then it's quite similar to what we're doing right now we're in this phase over here right and then there's the second drop okay and that all again came down to us breaking that key trend right key trend once we dropped those big levels that's when things started to shift down so important to know that right important to know that Okay, are we going to just range sideways here and this is maybe the bare market lows and we're just going to sit here and people need to forget about the pain for this market to reset. Right? So why these long sessions come here is that if you sit in a loss or a breakup or anything in your life, right, and you're sitting in it for for two years, right, it doesn't really hurt someone. You actually kind of start to forget it, right? Anything that hurt you two years ago, you kind of start to forget it. And then there can be life for you to maybe try it again, right? So I remember people that kind of flushed out in 2018 when I started like they haven't and when 2021 came after like two three years they were like okay let me try it again right type of thing. Um so that's what tends to happen is this like now who trusts anything? So if we do decide to go into that long period that's why they take a little bit long right people need to kind of forget about the pain. Um got serious in 2023. Oh, nice. Cool, cool, cool. Um, but the question is this. So, the key here that we kind of tracking is we had the first trend that we let's say lost and this is why we are fighting the tops exactly where we are now, right? And then we had this one over here which was the there's another leg incoming. Okay. And that's the important one that I want us to pay attention to. So, that line is very much this bottom line over here. just get back to here, which is this trend here, just to say, okay, is there a secondary leg kind of coming in? And this does still give us a little bit of bullish hopes, right? If we hold this, we could still see some some upside and maybe even a trap. Maybe we are here, right? Because this is also rough, right? But Bitcoin from $65,000 down to $30,000 sat here from May all the way till basically August, right? And then we ended up having a higher high and that was old season, right? Old season happened a little bit here, but this is where it really started to spark up. Just a little bit of that hope for as long as we sit above this trend over here. Um, and then the big thing is this damage here, right? And this dominance doing this over here has not really I don't think a lot of people have lost faith in Bitcoin. Even myself, I'm like, \"Oh, maybe I should just stop trading Bitcoin.\" Not saying I want to leave crypto forever, but definitely alcoins were a big one. that was uh uh dropped off. And it's basically this very big area here that no one's going to believe anything until we're actually back up to the high areas here. Right? So, I want to show you guys this chart of what I built up over here."

And it's basically this very big area here that no one's going to believe anything until we're actually back up to the high areas here. Right? So, I want to show you guys this chart of what I built up over here. And I think it's important just to to do it because right now, if we hold this trend and we keep doing what we are doing, then we need to go look at what has happened the last couple of weeks. And that's what the market's going to continue doing, right? So, if we look at, okay, we finally got some push last week. There was a double digit green day, right? We know they're not going to last long. We know we're very very likely go down to the bottom. Right now, we can kind of prep ourselves for trading wise, prep ourselves strategy wise, prep ourselves timing wise, mindset wise, portfolio-wise. Cool. Right. But the important thing here is when does that change? When do we start thinking other scenarios? And then what do we kind of do? You know, that's the important thing. And that's why here I've marked that this 80 to 85,000 is still giving us the strong understanding that between this 80,000 and between 100 105,000, right? Very similar to the market that we're seeing now. Okay, that's kind of where we're going to stay and remain. Okay, so this down push we are seeing now could just be a higher low for push up to the higher areas. But is it going to last very long if we don't get through there? No. it's very likely to come back down into the 80,000s, right? So, it gives us an understanding of, okay, let's not uh um think where it's going to go. Let's just kind of play the game the way it's been played because if we sold two weeks ago, let's say, or week ago when we saw that nice little pump, not really long term, not happy selling longterm, but just took a little bit more off the table and just didn't take a trade for seven days and we kind of did that a bit more, we'd all be screaming enjoy on the pullback now to be buying, right? And I think that's the thing. How do we turn things into these opportunities that we are seeing? Okay, if anything below this 80,000, right, and a specifically a weekly close, we do need to look at the possibilities of a $65,000 to a $71,000 range on Bitcoin. And that will take us back to the best strategies that we could have used in this time over here. And luckily having this leg does give us a a a shorter period of time to to go relook at that leg, right? And go relook at what were the key areas of where we really accelerated. And if I shorted here and did this and did this and did that, right? What would have this ultimately uh become and that will be the exact kind of strategy you'll start be moving if we go into that play over there, right? Which means the shorting of stuff. Now again, I always want to be very wary of getting too much in short mentality when we've had this happen to all coins, right? Like the shorting is is quite crazy. But if we're in bare markets, the market will continue to do so, right? And it will continue to to to give you this 30% up and then 50% down. Not to say we're going to go much lower than where we are. I don't think we're going to go much lower, but I do think that this can happen, right? And these percentages end up being big. So the key thing here is to keep the key zones here. And when things kind of shift for now, for as long as we hold here, we're still optimistic to 105 to 111,000. And whatever this market's doing, and it has been doing, it's very likely it's going to continue doing, right?"

And whatever this market's doing, and it has been doing, it's very likely it's going to continue doing, right? When we finally get a bit of strength, ultra will wake up nice and strong to the range. Now the important thing is that for me specifically that I am now going to start a strategy of going into Bitcoin you know type of thing um that will remain for as long as we are in this bare market territory and this bare market territory for me is is basically this 111,000 right it's basically above mid-range above like this is where I see the market really starting to get excited again and where I really start to bigger moves incoming and people kind of forgetting about the pain and starting to get excited again right anything until then I don't think many are going to get super excited okay so for me it will still be very much yes alts are moving now have one or two of them do the plays cool cool but don't lose the focus of getting good at Bitcoin now just because your altcoin bag started waking up right remembered the higher time frame play so for me the bullish break is us actually exiting this area of this 111 getting above that. Okay. And anything until then I still got to think bare market vibes, right? And then the important thing is also just kind of looking at the top trend, right? So another thing as well just to quickly add to this. This is I need to put myself in a mentality of bare markets. So that it just teaches me to really look at how am I going to make money in these periods right now. Okay. what am I going to trade? What strategy I'm gonna trade? How I'm going to basically do it. Right. On the other side of that, I still have my fiveyear 10-year plans of making a bunch of money. And that doesn't necessarily mean I'm just going to sell out of all my alts and stuff. I'm still going to hold a lot of my altcoin bags because the interesting chart here specifically, this is why for me, we never got an alt season. We never got a run that we were waiting for, right? Is just look at the top line on alts, right? Right. So if you look at the top line here on Bitcoin, you can see that the previous all-time high in 2017 and the next one in 2021, you can see we tagged it perfectly. Right? So it looks like this line over the last really 10 years has been quite accurate for highs on Bitcoin. Right? It's been these really tracking these highs over here to the upside. And I think that one day we are going to go to let's say a million dollars on Bitcoin. we'll have to break this momentum because this is actually showing us slowing down on the highs, right? So, one day we're going to have to really get outside of that, right? To to go to those crazy crazy crazy numbers. But, nonetheless, you could see now we're back at support. But that gives me a good idea and it still just shows me here, you know, for the long-term approach. Um, you know, altcoins are still incredibly oversold, specifically good ones. And for me that two trillion mark at some point will still for me get hit right and still follow the same system of what Bitcoin is doing over here. Okay, it just seems at this point timing is very different than what it used to be. Okay, but that that for me is still a very important chart here to to to pay attention to. So again, this is where I will maybe consider going back to making my main trading focus. Until then, it ain't right. I'll still trade one or two now and then. Cool. Okay."

But when it comes to size, when I want to build, when I want to do anything, I guarantee you if we did Bitfunner challenges and we trade Bitcoin, we will not smash our accounts and lose the challenges a lot. We we will survive a lot more because Bitcoin is actually a little bit not necessarily easier to trade, but the ranges are smaller. Like it is better, right? It's a lot easier to survive. So, we'll pass more bid funds, which means we'll have more unlocks of capital that we can use to the upside, right? there's so many tools to make money to the upside and I think that's the big thing. Then when it just comes to alts like I just showed you now I still think there's huge opportunity and I still think there is this line here of support and this is kind of we don't want to see much lower lows than what the altcoins made this week right specifically over the last three days lower than this we need to start thinking about these areas down here right which is basically this 650 700 billion range um but ultimately it's levels all the way back you know before we had Trump before we had those crazy areas you It's ETH back at 2K. It's Lana back at 80 bucks. You know, these are type of things to think. Until then, we are in a bear, right? But there ain't anything stopping us from having these ranges slightly start to expand over here, but they are still not my top priority. Right? I will still trade little ones where I can and still do these things. We got to get above this wall. Once we get above this wall of this 1.1 1.2 too then I get quite excited right so the exciting part of me is just whenever I can 20% of capital going forward previously it used to be 50 70 I would buy all coins buy all coins buy all coins right but for now it's like okay there is a exciting part in the future I don't think it's done I just think people mentally have to recover from all the losses when that's done all coins will come back to life right there there's no doubt about it um So 20% every month of what I can buy some alts, some good alts, right? And that's it. And think about the long term there, right? That's starting to think a little bit more mature and and but then on the other side it's like I need to make money shortterm, right? That's why for me I built a plan of obviously Bitcoin in the key levels. So all I'm doing is just really like where is my focus going to be for the next three months? Like where am I focusing? Because I ain't quitting. I I you ain't going to knock me down like this. I want to make I'm going right. I'm going to rip things. Um, let's match up, but the focus has been a problem. Oh, I'm here, then I'm here, then I'm here, then I'm here. Right? All these different things. And anything when it comes to my bots and things like that, I've made sure that there stops and I've made sure that this can be survived, right? This can be survived and that means like ultimate protection zone right now. Got an alt. So when else break this level bull market zone until then bare market zone and this trend will indicate for me those lower areas over there. Now I want to quickly go through uh mid time frames."

This can be survived and that means like ultimate protection zone right now. Got an alt. So when else break this level bull market zone until then bare market zone and this trend will indicate for me those lower areas over there. Now I want to quickly go through uh mid time frames. Um before I do so the important thing that I also want to wrap my head around specifically sorry money um specifically this year as well is to just remember that all my time and effort I've learned a skill, but the skill has been wrapped around one topic, right? Crypto, but that skill can work anywhere in the world. And I've never taken that to my advantage. I've never really used that to my strength, right? So, the next thing that's very important for me is I don't want to chase too much of the pumps happening. There's a lot of things that are pumping stock marketwise, right? And commodity wise and and all different things like incredible. Um, and if that's where money is to be made, then I really need to for the next three months. This is a part of the three month shift for me is to just study that. It's quite unknown the platforms and how it all kind of works. But trading is trading. And to be honest, there's there ain't as much wick there like we see on exchanges here, right? There's way more volume, right? So when you full orders, they're full. You don't lose too much on opening trades. You don't lose this, do that. So I'm quite excited as well to realize that built a trading skill, right? Not a crypto skill, a trading skill. And that's a big thing as well to to to to shift into. So that is something that I want to start bringing a little bit more into the shows. Okay. And the thing is as well like I also realize now like we don't also have to um relearn the whole system. Right. So this is why again just highlighting BDC that for me USDT can buy stock tokenized stocks now. Right. So we go here to the markets. we go here to tokenized stocks and I can trade them. So for me, this is going to be a big part of just tracking them. See the percentages I think are a little bit less, not as volatile. Um, understanding the leverage a little bit more, but really starting to to shift and understand. So remember guys, if you don't have or want a BDC account, we do have a 10% bonus. Link below is in the description. But the main purpose of this here is to is to start looking and remind ourselves that we are traders. We are not just crypto traders, right? I believe in crypto in the long term, made a lot of wealth in crypto. Um, but ultimately it it ain't everything. Okay, now let's go short time frame, midtime frame, and give you guys my view. So, short time frame, we got to start getting our head around going down to that big trend. So, to go back here to the higher time frame, uh, on Bitcoin here, uh, is this here. There's nothing stopping us from coming down to this trend again, right? Right? And that for me, we got to see strong buying power in those areas. So, as we kind of zoom in, we can see it. But as we zoom in, we can also see that right now we can think a little bit more bearish um than bullish. Um and maybe there's some shorting opportunities. We'll go through a couple setups now. Um again, I need to now get used to just this chart, right? Not just the the old coin charts anymore. There's so many of them. Um just give it two sec. Yo, brother. >> Oh, sorry. Okay, I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it. Okay, I'm sending to you now. >> Hey, where you coming? Constant. >> Okay, I've sent it to you. Thank you, bro. Oh, Dylan, Lord of Entry is coming to visit me."

Um so again if I look at this now it does look like momentum is moving to the downside. So we lost the trend. There's a big area of bare control now and we we need to recover this pretty quickly if we are bullish right specifically midterm frame as it stands right now. I'm kind of bracing myself for this right and we'll obviously see how we react over here. The important thing for me as we are doing that is obviously to kind of track that down. wait for a real bounce on this side, we we'll see some opportunity. But as it stands, bearish, right? Which means if I am kind of looking at let's say some shorting, which is going to be uh I'm going to get some used to with Bitcoin. Um I'm kind of tracking this up, right? And if we start losing this over the next few hours, there can be nice shorts. I'm quite excited to have like way less less risk if I must be honest. if I look and we get here and we start to lose this a little bit later on. I can short there and I look at the percentages are a lot smaller, right? So I can start really focusing on that. Um and again doesn't matter which may just be Bitcoin and alts. It's kind of the same thing, right? Alts have also lost a lot of these key levels here. Um we must remember though that there are a lot of RSIs um getting reset. So specifically the 12-hour daily and the weekly. It's important to see this week is going to cross again to the downside. Um that for me will all determine on if we kind of hold this this 80,000 um dollar zone on the down but right now a little bit more bearish than bullish. Okay. And then for bullish so again I don't want to kind of predict that we this might be a whole trap, right? And the trap would look something like that. That's when I kind of turn I look for longs. Right now I'm in the mentality of not trading too much but kind of looking for shorts, right? And obviously the shiny objects is to go short the damn altcoins. But for me I have to change the mentality. I have to look at ways of making money with Bitcoin because ultimately the risk will be looked after a little bit more itself. Right? This don't mean I won't talk about L coins in my shows. I will talk about altcoins. It's just where my focus personally in my trading is going and my bigger trades and these type of things. So, this is where I would need to see bullish control or something like this. Until then, I'm kind of tracking this move up and getting ready for a 80,000. We should see a bounce there. Um, altcoins, same thing. So, alcoins also lost that trend. So, we kind of need to get ourselves in this mentality of uh possible another push down and there is support there. It's that big trend and a big wick we made. Um, this is where we need some to see some strength incoming over here. So, I'm kind of also just tracking this to the downside. Okay. But as it stands, bare, right? Um, and the key here is to not like even if it breaks this top trend for me, I ain't going to turn straight bullish, I need to basically reclaim the level, right? This is where bears are holding. So, let it ride, let it come, let it go. Right? That's something for me in a bullish scenario. Right now, we're kind of sitting on the fence when it comes to the bear."

And this is a big thing for me as well. Right? It's kind of like So again, I'm making the decision that probably 60% 70% of trades and that will be focused around Bitcoin. Okay, times like this, I'm probably going to go 90 to 95% I'm just going to be focusing on Bitcoin. Um, and so I need to know, okay, when will that also kind of change, right? Things like that. So, I've set up a Bitcoin dominance chart, which I think is a a cool structured chart um to to just give you where things so for as long we can see here, right? This dominance specifically all the way since November, it's kind of just been going like this. High time frame is looking a bit hopefully bearish, but it just hasn't turned bearish, right? But when I zoom in, I'm like, okay, like what have we done for the last three months? You can kind of see that the 60% and this 58% are basically the range. Okay. And for me, I'm no longer going to sit and say, \"Okay, um, this does look bearish or break this trend. I'm going to go full altcoin type of thing.\" It's more I'm going to focus 90% of my time on possibly Bitcoin trades right now. And the time where I shift to 20% alcoin focus, right, will be when we actually break this level that we haven't broken all the way since November, right, which is this one over here. So, we break above there, which is very likely an option. Like, it ain't going to get better for altcoin strength, right? And as much as on high time frame, again, I have conviction for my long-term portfolio. I will hold those alts. I have conviction of alt season. when it comes to trading and realistic views where we are now if we break this like we're going up here to 62 63 again right type of thing so for as long as we're actually above this green box you know it's it's going to be high priority for me to to think of that but again it can change very quickly right if we look at this time over here in May and I think it was this time here right one day can change everything so I need to keep that in mind as well right I don't want to be sleeping on the alts and give up on alts at the bottom right that's that's not the point here. So for me, when we break this box here, okay, this is really good for altcoins. This is really good strength and that's when I'll start tapping into 20 30% of my trades all coins now as well and kind of get moving. Until then, I just have focus. And I think if we focus on one or two specific things, we can get really good and we can turn this crappy market into a very good market because it's actually quite volatile at this point. Um, and obviously if we lose this bottom here, there's a big drop off to the early 50s that we've been waiting for. Um, and I still 100% believe we will hit there. Um, so just a nice little play and a structure of where we are at with that. When it comes to to ETH, couple of L coins have started to actually reclaim a little bit of the the trend. So ETH is looking pretty bullish. It started catching up though with the dump. The other day it wasn't pulling back much and then it did start catching up, right? It started to to to to drop pretty quickly here. It was just holding so well 33 and then Right, we dropped off over here. We did not technically lose the main support trend."

We're actually back in there. So that is a little bit of strength and that we're seeing. But for me, we've made a lower low and this middle control point is still the big thing. So I still got to have this mentality of this kind of happening back to the 2627 maybe in a little bit low. We'll see how if Bitcoin holds 80K or not. Um and for me to be bullish on this is kind of this, right? So that's why specifically right now I would not focus so much on the ETH or any else that are looking like this because it's uncertain now, right? Still holding support. We're still below bare wall, right? Should I short? Should I long? Like I'm giving away way too much money when I'm trading setups like this. So for me, the Bitcoin one's making more sense. And for as long as Bitcoin does not break that trend, like I'm not going to take any trades, right? let us either break through, retest and turn bullish again and then then I'm happy or you know wait for the trend to break to the downside and that's the opportunity. So, this is looking better, but we are still sitting with this wall above here. And then we have the the short squeeze walls. Um, because one thing I also just want to show you guys here, I think I did it over here. I just did it quickly on the higher time frame stocks, right? And I got to remember something that we are still sitting in an oversold stochastic, right? I can actually make this a bit bigger so we can see it a bit more. Should be able to see that a bit more. Let's go over here. Okay. Okay, but I just got to remember a couple of things, right? Firstly, in the over oversold section, we could be going up slowly, but there's still very bad sentiments around. So again, not much trusted volume still quite low. This is why it tends to not kind of carry is very boring and you kind of snooze off very fast, right? The influx of people very low, right? But one thing that is important is short liquidations are increasing, right? Shorters in the market are increasing. So we must not forget that there are people shorting the market and there is a lot of liquidations falling higher up right and it's the same thing on our overbought and that's why we'll tend to see markets on any time frame on the RSI we kind of move slow when we move here and when we got here things start to speed up right that's because when the market goes oversold to overbought shorts start getting liquidated right it's the same thing on the other side when we go from overbought to oversold longs start get liquidated right so we got to remember that Whenever we're sitting here and the weekly is still in the middle here, we are still oversold, but we must not forget that the shorts are being formed and formed and formed, which means that the the short squeeze walls are sitting there, right? And once we through this patch here, that's why I have 38 and I got 42 and 44 and different levels on ETH. Okay, there is still that big opportunity, but again, I need this to shift and go. But there is I need to keep that in mind as well so that my strategy and my mindset is very much set um and ready for that at any point. When it comes to the rest of the alts, you can kind of see in sui at the moment it has started losing the trend a bit and even if we do this I still cannot trust it."

When it comes to the rest of the alts, you can kind of see in sui at the moment it has started losing the trend a bit and even if we do this I still cannot trust it. It's just this market has created this nonrust type of thing, right? And that's why for me Bitcoin's pumps you can kind of trust a bit but it's not as like super volatile. So for me, like there's still the wall over here of control of the bears. So even if we do this and we shoot up here, right, I'm not necessarily fully bullish. So for me, this has to kind of move up there, which means there's a little bit of time, right, until I'm doing longterm great time to accumulate, right? Then there's a couple of alts. Obviously, pump fun's looking quite strong. One of the better alts that are kind of here in the market. Um, and this could be one still of a bit of interest, but I do need to just look at this, right? So there, if the risk is worth it, this is a alt that's still in the trend. This is maybe one to consider, right? Again, I'm going to keep my focus, but for those who are looking, like here's opportunity, right? Um, I'm sure many of you guys are going to trade altcoins your whole lives, and I get it, right? I've been a altcoin junkie. Um, hi, I'm Sheldon, and I'm a altcoin holic, right? Um, I'm there. I'm quite quite experienced in that game. Um, same thing with Soul. So, Soul's level of control is there. So, anything's kind of thinking a little bit more, you know. Um, this is something that I kind of not touching right now specifically on trades. Um, because this here and then let's say we lose a trend. I might be shorting, but that's not right now. That's still in a couple maybe a day or two, right? Or maybe a couple of days. We got to kind of reclaim push then I know to go long or we push up here le trend I know to go short right kind of play the thing um pendle pumping let's have a look at pendle and you know what the thing is though guys it's this isn't specifically when I'm speaking about my own strategy that I'm kind of changing I'm always going to look to to to to play the alcoin moves when they do eventually wake up again right I'm just looking at longevity like I just look at the last four years and I'm just you know, I don't want to um kind of just chase the that that thrill, but then also having that downside. Um so, pendal's looking really good. Just remember on the daily there is resistance. So, same thing. This actually lost this trend. So, it's actually a bearish area. Um but if it gets through it, it's very strong, right? So, same thing with this, right? I wouldn't be just shorting it just to say we had a bearish wall. I'd kind of have to keep tracking this up a bit. It's still a little while till it turns bearish. And I'm not bullish either. I'm kind of neutral, right? And when you're neutral, I kind of got to pay attention to that. Um those things. What is Zcash actually doing? Keeping out of Zcash. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Okay. Uh let's see on any other other bigger alts right now. So a lot of them if you look at like AVAC, I lost that trend. So this thing can even get here and it's still bearish, right? So I must keep that uh in mind guys. Yesterday they did a lot of trading competitions in club. Go and join. We're giving away a lot of um bit funers there at the moment.

So, as these things are going down, it is balanced. This is why it's good to have a couple of alts like I have pump that's up 26%. Bitcoin's up a little bit, right? Couple of them are down a little bit, but overall balancing at four 4%. And you can also see that we're making money on the grid profits as well, which is good. So that's also below in the description. Shout out to uh to Pionex. Um okay, amazing. Um remember as well, gravity, guys. I'm going to start trading a bit more on gravity. The airdrop is coming in the next few weeks. So there's still opportunity if you're doing any trading anyway. And if it's just Bitcoin, like I said, you can accumulate points for airdrop, right? And we have seen some really big air drops over the last little while. So there's a Gravity link as well below for you to get some bonuses with with that. Um, and on that page, I will see you tomorrow with some Bitcoin trading setups. It's going to be different. Let's do it. But it's time for some big changes. Love you guys lots. Thanks for all the support and I'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye-bye."
