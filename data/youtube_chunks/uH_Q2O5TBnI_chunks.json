      "text": "It's been a roller coaster for a lot of people that are in not only crypto markets, but also traditional markets. It's been wild swings left, right, and center. And if you've been in crypto, you've probably witnessed this as well over the last couple of days. $2,000 pump, $3,300 dump, two $3,200 pump back towards the upside. Uh what happens next, right? That's the question. We'll also talk about why this is happening. Why are we seeing these world swings? and doesn't mean that the market is back. You can always go through to the poll section over here and you can vote. Did Trump's Davos speech where he of course said a whole lot which caused this type of price movement um you know save crypto has it saved not only the crypto markets but also the traditional markets. 20% of you believe or 21 now believe that we're back. 42% believe we're just going to continue to range and then 34% believe not even Trump can save Bitcoin over here. Um, and it's been like this. This has been the true story, right? Every day Trump, I might do something wild, stocks dump. I might do or I might not do something while stocks pump. But what if I just stocks dump? Oh, come on, man. I was just kidding. And stocks pump. And that's really been the messaging basically coming out yesterday, saying that we won't take Greenland with force, right? That was the one thing that led to some upside price action. The second thing that he said is that he's going to be removing the tariffs on the EU. Um and basically the market reacted and moved towards the upside. We saw some of the commodities dump in the moment. We saw the equities begin to spike back up and consequently crypto as a higher beta play or a more aggressive trade move back towards the upside as well. But can it remain? Well, an important thing to understand is when you see heavily news-driven markets, you want to do what's called reading the tape. So, when you start to see uh news-driven events create price to move back towards the upside, when you're already broken down some key levels and therefore in the start of a downtrend on the lower time frames and price can't maintain those levels following these news-driven events. Well, that is called reading the tape and it's telling you the tape is telling you that the market is still bearish. Now, we don't have the answer to that yet, but we should see over the course of today. So, I want to show you exactly what you need to look out for. And those are part of the reasons why I personally wouldn't allocate into Bitcoin just yet. That's one of the reasons is you need time, right? You need a little bit more time to read the tape to see exactly exactly what the uh equity market specifically is going to do. That's reason number one, and we'll talk about two other reasons as we do continue. So, stay tuned, smash the like button. It really helps us to get the show content out there. Um and we'll go straight into commodities. Looking at gold, high highs and high lows on the 4hourly. Um still looks bullish, still continuing up. Little bit of a pause exactly where we had marked out that take-profit opportunity. To be clear, I haven't taken any profits because I do believe that this will still probably rerate higher and you have of course your full confirmation breaking above 48.880 and you should see gold accelerating course higher. We have silver which had a bit of a flush towards the downside but I still think as well um even the low time frame trends over here are intact with those higher highs and higher lows. So that's looking good. And then platinum platinum has given a little bit of a throwback. So for anybody yesterday that you watched I said personally I'd wait for a bit of a throwback if you got something like that which occurred on that 4hourly candle of course just before Trump spoke or excuse me just after Trump spoke where where the commodities began to dump. you could have got your entry over there. And now I think it's almost safe to say that you can move your stop loss to break even on the platinum trade. I'm going to leave my trade. I'm not going to move the stops to break even yet. I'm going to give it a little bit more of a chance because I do believe you may see some further volatility similar to what we saw over Bitcoin over the last couple of days."

I'm going to give it a little bit more of a chance because I do believe you may see some further volatility similar to what we saw over Bitcoin over the last couple of days. I'm going to leave that platinum trade on the table exactly as is. No changes over here. Couple more closes above the red line with a 4hour lease and things should look good uh for higher, right? So, we'll leave that over there. No changes needed. Let's have a look at the S&P 500. Now, this is the important part where you do need to read the tape because you did also have a bit of a gap that occurred over here, right? So, when you get that futures gap, price came back into that gap and since has been rejecting. Now, I wouldn't be surprised to see this basically give all of this up again. And if it does, of course, that means that the stock market probably wants to correct in a more serious manner. So, keep an eye out on this. Basically, what you need to see from the stock market to reposition back into strength is first and foremost, um, you don't want to take out this candle. So, it needs to come down, holding back basically above 6,866. I wouldn't want to see any closes below that. It would need to reaccumulate, need to get back above there. And then ultimately the main level that I'd want to see taken out is going to be coming in over here at 7,000. If you can start to trade back and hold above 7,000, that's going to look really good for the S&P 500. Otherwise, I think that there's still a good chance and a high chance that this will begin to roll over um and things will be given up later on um today when the US markets open. So, Dow Jones still mostly okay. It's one of the stronger in out of the whole bunch. It is still holding up over here um above that yellow box. So all is good over there. And then we have uh QQQ. I'm now going to remove that trade which we said failed rejecting off that trend line. A little bit of a fake out came back down despite the Trump pump over there. Um you know a lot of sell pressure came in. So still lower lows and lower highs. And on the 4hourly time frame this could be rolling over. And then of course the same thing over here on Russell. So Apple has almost hit our final take profit over there coming down aggressively again. This also looks weak. We should see this trading down to about 235. Um, all righty. So, I think Unless there's any requests that are coming in for uh stocks or equities, commodities, anything else you want to see, let me know in the comments. Otherwise, let's move on and we'll go straight into um what's happening within the rest of the markets. First, I have to give a big shout out to one of our traders and the coaches in um in Whail in the Discord. We have Farooq over here. Absolutely crushing it. All the members are praising him over here. Big big big trades, right? Big trades over here. Again, shouting out Farukq from Toma. Everybody shouting out Farooq over here with some massive massive wins um in the gold market. So remember, there are a lot of trades to be taken. A lot of the guys are absolutely smashing it over there um on gold with those trades if you guys want to to get involved over there. Um and Dan says platinum bouncing perfectly off the 800 MA. Um interesting. I'm not using that one, but good to know. Good to know. So, platinum should continue. Now, what would need to happen for crypto to get into a position of strength? This is point number two. Reason number two for why I wouldn't want to get involved so or get long yet."

Um interesting. I'm not using that one, but good to know. Good to know. So, platinum should continue. Now, what would need to happen for crypto to get into a position of strength? This is point number two. Reason number two for why I wouldn't want to get involved so or get long yet. Reason number one was we want to read the tape. We want to see how the equity market opens um following a news-driven event which is of course Trump affecting price towards the upside. Reason number two is we want to see the total cryptocurrency market cap recapture and reclaim of course that bearish candle that led to the downside, the initial downside. Anything that occurs over here, you could get even tomorrow another green candle there over there and then ultimately that could fail. Basically, we need to recover that. Not only is that the candle that led to that downside, which is going to be a big psychological level, 3.1 trillion, but it also lines up exactly at the 50% level, which you can see I've marked out in purple over there. So, it's a big key level that must be reclaimed for the total cryptocurrency market cap, 3.1 trillion. Anything below that, treated as likely to fail, the rally likely to fail. So, that's your bit of hopeium over there to get back above. And this isn't part of the reason list yet, but it's something that we could consider. I was looking at the monthly scale. You can see, of course, it looks bearish, holding below the 20 MA over there, but that's not the point. The point was this. The point was I had a look at how many times in this entire bull run, this entire leg up over here. Have we seen a candle that has a body like that? Right, which continued to trade up higher at a later date? Well, there's only been a select few times. We had one over here. We had another one over here. And we had another one which was at the exact exact bottom. So, it's going to be very it's going to be very rare that you're going to see price ultimately um close this candle green. And if this candle is not going to close green, it's probably going to close red. And if it closes red, you can imagine there's a lot of free space in between the next major levels of support. You're of course going to find some support coming into this cluster over here. um in the whole $70,000 region, 60 to 70K region, there is going to be support over there. But uh if this candle starts to close red, it's going to start to look really really bearish. And again, just a reminder, there's only been a few times, three times, right? That was coming off of the FTX collapse lows. Got a big candle towards the upside. This one happened over here um in October 2023 where there was a bit of a stock market scare. You got quite an impulsive candle towards the upside. But this is all in the presence of what lines up with the timing cycle end firstly and where the timing cycle should begin for a new cycle and the next two happened in an uptrend. So what are the chances that you're going to have this monthly candle look like this without taking out that wick low? Basically the chances are very low and the chances are incredibly high that you will take out that wick low. Um which means it has to happen in the next nine days to have a chance to rally back towards the upside. And I think that that is another cause for concern and still risk within the market which would be one other reason why it maintain a little bit of a cautious approach on uh where things are currently at. The other thing is we still have USDT dominance still applying pressure into this."

And I think that that is another cause for concern and still risk within the market which would be one other reason why it maintain a little bit of a cautious approach on uh where things are currently at. The other thing is we still have USDT dominance still applying pressure into this. If we do start to see that Bitcoin candle turning down and um a failure for the total cryptocurrency market cap to get back above 3.1 trillion, expect USDT dominance will continue to mark up over there. Now we've seen a bit of a reset in the long to short ratio over here. Um you know sitting pretty balanced in a neutral territory. The skews just reset there negative0.22. We had some um periods where it got very very negative negative 56% and consequently we did get a bit of a squeeze towards the upside of course driven by the words of Trump at the Davos speech over there. Uh fear and greed sitting at 20. So in that capitulation environment what are the traders doing with their real money? Well, they are slightly slightly negative, right? So, there is still some shorts within the market which you can see over here. If we go through to um the institutional chart section on whail room, negative negative negative in terms of the deltas over there. So, there are some shorts that are on the table. We have flushed a lot of the market. Um of course, as you've seen over here, 2,000 pump, 3,300 dump, 3,200 pump washing machine for leverage traders. And consequently, we saw equal pretty much equal um in the last 24 hours 300 million shorts and 300 million longs taken out to create a combined 603. Right? So, we need things to settle. We need directionality, I believe, at least from the stock market. I think it's all eyes now on the stock market which always creates a little bit of a bigger risk um for if the stock market starts to come down over here that's going to of course wipe out a whole lot of people. So for Bitcoin well we have bounced exactly exactly off of that golden pocket. You've reclaimed that yearly open. It's too soon to um you know get all giddy and bullish over here. And I'm going to give you a similar level to what I've given you for the total cryptocurrency market cap in terms of those fib levels. you're definitely going to want to reclaim 92,559. And what's so interesting about this number is if we just pair these up next to each other, well, the 50% level taken from the range high down to the current low for total cryptocurrency market cap is exactly where that candle opened up. And this is the candle that I said you'd need to recover. And if you wanted to be short, theoretically, you could be short with a stop-loss floating above there. Well, it's exactly the same thing for Bitcoin. 100% identical. Basically, Bitcoin must must must reclaim this candle over here, which just so happens to coincide with that 50% level. So, your number to get back above 92,559. If bulls can successfully do that, we can maybe consider um this to be a shakeout, right? Then you can say, you know what, maybe that's a shakeout. Maybe bulls are back. Maybe we've seen enough of a flush and damage um and we've met some of these metrics where we're looking for um over1 billion dollars worth liquidated which we saw uh over the last 48 hours. Right. So, a lot of work to be done from the the uh bulls over here. I do actually expect that there's a good chance that maybe tomorrow you're going to get another candle towards the upside basically one two and three and then ultimately probably dumping into the course of the weekend. And and that's that's the most uh probable outcome in my personal opinion. So uh we still have the presence of the bare flag. We still have relatively low volume and bulls are fighting at this volume point of control at 87,800."

We still have relatively low volume and bulls are fighting at this volume point of control at 87,800. But this is reason number three that I wouldn't want to allocate yet. Right? Reason number three is that the bare flag is still valid. This has not been invalidated. We must must must must see bulls reclaim higher prices first and foremost getting back above that 92,559 to invalidate the bare flag. Until then until we actually see price do something like this and spend more time up here above 95k. This bare flag is still valid and the bare flag is always more likely to break towards the downside. Um and we we need to see bulls really really fight to avoid that. consolidating at these lows is incredibly bearish and when paired up with things that look like that ultimately unfortunately guys it is a bit more of a bearish picture than a bullish picture. So, if you are looking to earn on your USDT, right, maybe you just want to stake capital over there. Remember that we are partnered over here with Figure Markets. There's a link in the description below. So, if you want to get involved with that, Figure Markets are offering um democratized loans over there. So, you can see over here you can get up to 9% so 8.5% by lending and then you'll be entered into the uh competition where you can win $25,000. So, you'll get an entry for I believe every dollar that you stake. The most that you can go up to, I believe, is $25,000. So, just read the the uh terms and conditions over there. But, if you do want to participate, they are going to be doing a big draw. $25,000 will be given away in the form of USDC. So, if you want to increase your odds to win, everything is linked below. These are the steps you have to follow. Download the Figure Markets app. go to earn, select, democratize prime. Choose the pool that you want to be entered into where you're going to stake your your USDT or your capital and you'll earn on that. Um that doesn't disappear, right? You don't lose that. Uh and then ultimately follow the rest of the steps and they'll they'll make their um their their draw soon. I'll let you guys know who wins. All right, we'll have a look at a couple of the altcoins as well. Very much the same thing. Still downside over here. aggressive downside selling for ETH followed by some consolidations. This is just consolidative bounce within a further downtrend. You have wicked again exactly into the mid-range, but ultimately I think that the path that this will follow is going to be the same as Bitcoin, right? So, if Bitcoin is going to go down, it's going to be a pretty risky environment. Um, what else? What else have we got? Let me know in the comments. Let me know in the comments if there is anything in particular that that you guys want to have a look at. Um, and we'll do it. Bit Unix draw today asks Dan. Uh, we will do it on Monday, right? I didn't prep to do it today, so let's do it on Monday. We'll do another thousand giveaway on Monday for for anyone that has signed up to Bit Unix. Um, there is a link in the description below if you want to get involved. Uh, it is Let's just see. There we go. It is over there. So, if you want to join in on the list, it is over there and we'll pull the list for Monday. Okay. Um, XRP. Yes, let's have a look at XRP because one of the things that I did say yesterday, remember yesterday we looked at the gold and platinum continuing its gains, the breakout."

Yes, let's have a look at XRP because one of the things that I did say yesterday, remember yesterday we looked at the gold and platinum continuing its gains, the breakout. We looked at silver getting a little bit sketchy, but I showed you the 4hourly is maintaining um that uptrend still, so it's okay. Uh we looked at Tesla, which we said we're stopping out of that trade early, so no regrets over there. Apple almost hitting the final TP. Um we we had a look at um Micro Strategy continuing its its um downside trajectory which we've been in the short trade. So let's quickly just reevaluate that. Pretty much the same thing. Remember Micro Strategy came out as a big buyer, but there's not really any other buyers and the small pumps that we've been getting have been completely news-driven. We spoke about Robin Hood being right on a knife's edge. So there it is. theoretically could start to enter into short if price doesn't move off of Trump's basically bullish talk. By the way, it's not the only thing that he said. It wasn't that it wasn't only that they're not taking Greenland with with um you know through war or violence uh the um at least elimination of those tariffs on EU. But he also came out and he said that the stock market will probably double. All right. So he said in the next I don't know what the timeline was few months to a year you'll probably see the stock market double. So if the stock market doesn't follow through then expect these things are going to start to trade in the opposite direction and there's no more buyers. Um because that's kind of like squeezing that last bit of liquidity when you come out and say things like that. You could see a bit of a deeper correction over there. All right then we need to have a look at Monero. Let's go back to Monero because that's one of the trades that we spoke about. So, Monero still coming down, still bearish. Unfortunately, this is probably going to come all the way back down, full retrace back to 424. The other thing that we had to look at is the Tron short trade. Tron short trade is still in the money in profit. It will probably do what Bitcoin does. If you're looking at this from a daily perspective, strong candle towards the downside, maybe get um you know, two or three days of relief over here. uh but to invalidate this basically must reclaim the entire candle that led to that downside move on Tuesday otherwise this is bearish expect lower prices and short we got taken out right or at least I closed that I've got stopped out of the pip and short trade um you know I spoke about it in Discord maybe maybe they caught wind that we're all short and they decided to squeeze us out taken out of that trade so that's one soldier that has fallen Um XRP was the other one which was the request. So let's quickly go to XRP. It is still in struggle street right in my personal opinion. Look at that candle. It attempted to get back above this one over here which was Tuesday's down candle. We said you need to recover that specifically on a closing basis. Um came came up smashed through the top sold off again. I I still think this looks incredibly weak for XRP. It's got a lot of work to do. All right. Lot of work to do over there. All right. What else? What else, guys? Uh, Pippen stopped you, Dan. Yeah, me too. Me, too. We out on Pippen. I didn't take any loss. I stopped out at broke at break even. It's a little bit frustrating because I'm still pretty certain that Pippen will eventually full retrace all the way back down to 0.023."

It's a little bit frustrating because I'm still pretty certain that Pippen will eventually full retrace all the way back down to 0.023. But, um, unfortunately uh, you know, if you're paying funding to be short, sometimes it's not worth continuing to hold. You need to catch this and play it out in quick succession. All righty. Rivershort says, um, Zam, I don't know if that's how we pronounce it. Rivershort. I'll have a look at River. I I don't even know the name, but let's let's quickly have a look at I don't know this coin, whatever this is, but we'll have a look at River. Um, you say there's a river short. Look, you need to wait for confirmation. It's going to be very similar to Pippen, right? You need to get a confirmed reversal. This is still aggressively moving towards the upside. So it's like remember when you're shorting there's a lot of risk involved because price can only go down 99.99%. But um which means if it goes against you it can go up for infinity. So on the long side if the trade goes wrong you lose what you put in. On the short side you can blow your whole account if you're on cross margin. So be very careful. Okay. Uh S&P 500 we already did. S&P6900 we can have a look at if that's the request over there very bearish new lows test one test two test three test four close below um this is a breakdown right I definitely don't really believe in triple bottoms right one two three very very very unlikely consolidating at these lows ultimately um S&P6900 is probably going to go back a whole lot lower and um you've just got this descending triangle almost that's formed over here. So, where you going to be looking at? Pretty much literally you're going to have to target these lows at 2590. Okay. 2590. So, very bearish on SPX6900. River funding is too high. Yeah. Look, stay away from those things rather. You're going to get wrecked. You're going to get wrecked. Even though we know that the most of these things are are going to be total rugpools and they're going to zero, you're going to end up getting hurt if you don't time it to perfection. Okay. Um, what else? What else have we got over here? Let's have a quick look through the list. Just see if anything else is pumping, anything comes to mind that um, we should be in a trade in. For now, it's more just about managing the positions. I did speak about that yesterday as well that I'm not looking to take too many additional positions. Let's just stick with what we've got and manage them. I think that um, the equity or or the commodities at least provide one of the better opportunities still. And um I just want to go back to that. You know, for anyone that was late on the platinum trade, this is probably a better risk-to-reward entry over here where you could now stop underneath that low. All righty. So, you're looking at this to now be a breakout and continuation. So, you're just re-entering the trade over here if you didn't get in. Stops go below these lows. Uh which is pretty much your your stop would be where our original entry was. But this is now the opportunity for this to continue higher. That is on uh platinum. So, expecting commodities to continue their run over there. Okay. Uh Mark Fraser still in the Tron short. Me, too. I'm also still in the short trade over there. We in the money. Uh did we have a look at that one? I think we did. Let's just quickly click on it and make a double show. So, let's go to Tron. There it is. Yeah, we did. We looked at this one. I covered that. Okay. Uh pump. We can have a look at that."

I'm going to clean that up a little bit. Um, but again, do you want to long something when the rest of the market looks like it wants lower? I don't know. I'm not so sure. I'd rather wait. I'd rather wait, but theoretically pump is reclaiming some key levels over there. Okay, what else? What else, guys? Let me know in the comments. Um, what I'll do is because the market is a bit more quiet tomorrow, I might skip the video tomorrow and rather just focus on uh what's going on in Whail. Maybe I'll move the video for tomorrow into Whail Room for tomorrow. So, for any of you that are in Whaloom, just keep an eye out. Um, you guys all have access to this site as well. Everything is listed over there with all the um the the Zoom sessions that we do. Now, it's YouTube sessions, right? If you want to if you want to watch any of those sessions, just go through over there. You'll see what time we are going live. Um, and I think we'll maybe move that till then. So, that's it from me folks. I will see all of you on the next one. I do hope you have a lovely day wherever you guys are in the world. We'll see you soon and cheers for now."
