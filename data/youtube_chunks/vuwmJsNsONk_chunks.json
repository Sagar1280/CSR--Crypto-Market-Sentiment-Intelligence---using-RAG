      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse. Today we're going to talk about Ethereum using logarithmic regression. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and also check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at intothecryptoverse.com. That sale is about to end. So, if you would like to lock in the lower rate, make sure you do so very soon. Let's go ahead and jump in. So, I don't know why, but a lot of times the last video I make of the year is usually about Ethereum. I don't want to say that's what it always has been, but I feel like just the December 31st, I I often will talk about Ethereum. And one of the things I was thinking about, I think by the end of the year, you always start reflecting on kind of like what went right, what went wrong over the last year. And I put out a video on that yesterday. Um, but as I did that, it it really got me thinking longer ago about when I first started this YouTube channel back in 2019. And one of the first models that I published was this logarithmic regression model. And you can see that and it is somewhat cringe. Uh but hope you guys can can get past it. This was the video that I put out when I first created this logarithmic regression trend line, right? and and the regression trend line that you're looking at is essentially just this one all the way down here where back in late 2019, you know, you can see the price of Ethereum was a little above $100. And we sort of speculated that the next low in say late 2022 would be around $800 if this regression model were to hold. What's interesting is that that ended up more or less happening, right? like the low ended up being around 880. So it wasn't exactly correct, right? And obviously predicting the peak was even more difficult, but it more or less played out, right? More or less in terms of measuring the lows, which again continued to make me think that the regression model was worthwhile to follow. Now we talked about it again. So this this video was from 6 years ago, right? 6 years ago. And then we had this video from 5 years ago where this is when I used to make the charts um and and you know talk about them outside of Trading View, right? This is when I made them on my own and and you know we sort of talked about Ethereum doing something like that, right? like where it would go up into the end of 2021 and then ultimately um come back down right to the regression band. What's interesting is that as this happened, as it came back down in late 2022, it begrudgingly stayed above the regression band, right? Like it didn't actually go into it. And you can see that here, right? as it came down, it didn't really quite want to go into the regression band. And so when that happened, we started this kind of this mantra of Ethereum needs to go home, right? And essentially what that meant was that the price of Ethereum was allowed to go up according to the rules of the cryptoverse, but it was only going up because Bitcoin was going up and the ETH Bitcoin valuation was bleeding. So during that time obviously just holding Bitcoin was a far better investment than holding Ethereum. And if you are an ETH maxi it doesn't really matter you know like like it doesn't really matter if you didn't like that. It was objectively true right like it was objectively true that from late 2021 until April of 2025 you would have been far better off holding Bitcoin than Ethereum. And the reason I sort of held that view was that historically it took until Ethereum went home to really start to form these lows for the Bitcoin valuation, right? And so that was why I looked at this and said, \"All right, maybe now Ethereum can finally go to all-time highs.\" But I really just want to get back to the root of of the regression model because I do feel like there has been some validity to it. You know, did we technically go below it in 2020 with a recession? Yes. Is it possible that could happen again that we get a recession and we go below the regression band? Yes, it's possible."

You know, did we technically go below it in 2020 with a recession? Yes. Is it possible that could happen again that we get a recession and we go below the regression band? Yes, it's possible. But I think one of the great things about a chart like this is that you don't necessarily need to know what's going on in the macroverse or, you know, the unemployment rate or inflation or any of this other stuff or Bitcoin dominance or the ETH Bitcoin pair, right? You don't really have to know any of that stuff to find some value from a chart like this. And one of the difficult things I had to face in 2021 as the bare market started to unfold in 2022 and I think there were some videos about this where I started like extrapolating that regression band to see like where it would be and I realized that it would take until 2026 for the fair value of Ethereum to reach $2,000. Now, think about how insane that idea is. First of all, if you're a Bitcoin maxi, you're just you're just going to say the fair value is is zero because obviously you just think everything besides Bitcoin is going to zero. But if if there's some part of you that is open-minded to other things in the cryptoverse succeeding besides just Bitcoin, um even though the majority of my portfolio for crypto has and always will be Bitcoin, I think there's some room for justification for other assets at certain points in the market cycle. And you know, from April until this all-time high, I think was a great way to make some money in the cryptoverse. Now, when I look at a chart like this, I think back to 2021 and 2022 when I first was looking at this and kind of recognizing, hey, how is it possible that the fair value of Ethereum is going to be only $2,000 by 2026 when the price of Ethereum was already at $4,000 in 2021. We have our answer now, right? Because this is what happened. The price has just gone absolutely nowhere. And you could argue the price has gone absolutely nowhere because the regression ban has just been slowly catching up. You see, you can pretty clearly see it. last cycle, the last business cycle, 2017, 2018, 2019, going into 2020, it didn't take us long to really get all the way down there to then propel us to more durable all-time highs that we could then, you know, we went from $90 to 4,900 or 4,800. And that was one of the more exciting times in my investing career. I think a lot of people here have also, you know, wanted that to return and it just simply hasn't. Um, but that doesn't mean it won't ever. Okay? It doesn't mean it won't ever. So, I want to talk a little bit about that. But again, if you if you do want to check out into the cryptoverse premium, we have three extra videos each week beyond the ones I do on YouTube. We also have a lot of Telegram posts. Make sure you guys check that out. Links in the description below. You can also scan that QR code if you would prefer. When I think about, you know, how this is ultimately going to look when we look back on this in 10 years or something, it's not going to really matter. A lot of people keep asking me, can Ethereum go to an all-time high before the bare market? Yeah, I mean, anything's possible, right? Like, I I don't know. I mean, it could, but at the end of the day, even if that happens, is it really something you're going to write home about if it's not a sustained rally?"

I mean, it could, but at the end of the day, even if that happens, is it really something you're going to write home about if it's not a sustained rally? So, what I think that the cryptoverse is accepting is that if you kind of continue to extend this out, what it's going to eventually look like, regardless of whether Ethereum is able to wick to a new alltime high or not, is that I think Ethereum will spend some more time in this regression band in 2026. Whether we just go kind of straight down into it and then just kind of hover there, whether we go back up and then come back down, do something like that, like that's always possible. That this would be the butterfly harmonic. So, if you are wishing for a new all-time high, uh just know that that would likely be that butterfly harmonic pattern because it would it would probably correspond to a Bitcoin lower high. And when that happens, it would likely then lead to a lower low for Ethereum, which is not really something that I think a lot of people want to see, but that is something that that could happen. If that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, I would say one thing to like look at with Ethereum is if you look at like the the valuation of Ethereum against something like silver, it's already below the 2022 lows, okay? And and it didn't have a new all-time high. So just remember anything is always possible. When you measure Ethereum against something other than just a fiat, you know, a fiat coin going asmtoically to zero like the US dollar. You can see that in some ways it's already below the 2022 lows. One of the reasons for the price appreciation of a lot of assets over the long term is just because they keep on printing more money. So then you need to find the assets that are actually going to do well. When you look at a chart like this, what it looks like to me is it just kind of looks like this chart where Ethereum struggled and then it finally had a nice rally against silver back in 2019 and then it just kind of topped out and then we went into this the doldrums of the 2019 social interest going to zero and then the pandemic induced recession. You could argue it's just very similar just maybe a slightly different slope. what I think like what I think is going to happen over the longer term. Okay, I cannot tell you what's going to happen next week or next month. What I think is going to happen over the longer term is that Ethereum will spend time consolidating in this area. Okay? And we're then eventually going to come out of 2026 and maybe goes into 2027. I don't know. um will eventually come out of it and we'll relive these glory days. But unfortunately, the time frame for a more durable bull market that lasts for say a couple of years, it's probably not happening right now. Notwithstanding, I mean, even if Ethereum gets another rally back up before it comes back down, I think something like that is just simply going to have to wait um for next cycle is is what I truly believe. And I think I could say that regardless of what's going on in the macro. Like, I don't need to know what interest rates are. I don't need to know what the inflation rate is. I don't need to know what the unemployment rate is. I don't need to know any of that stuff to be able to look at this chart and say, \"Look, Ethereum has always spent a considerable amount of time in these regression bands before going to new all-time highs.\" And you can see we did it like we went to the regression band and then we went to a new all-time high. It was relatively short-lived."

It was relatively short-lived. Maybe we have to go to it again in 2026 and then in 2027 or 2028 things can finally pick back up as interest rates potent, you know, potentially come back down and as we get more into the quantitative easing part of the cycle. From a macro perspective, if you wanted to incorporate monetary policy into this chart, what you could say is that this part of the bull market right here for Ethereum, this in 2019 is essentially this whole thing from this cycle. And the reason for that is because if you were to overlay total assets held by the Federal Reserve, you can see that basically as quantitative tightening was, you know, sort of in the final stages um before it ended, that's what Ethereum was doing. And and you can see kind of the same thing has happened this cycle. The only difference is that it the the QT phase of the of the cycle lasted a lot longer. So arguably right now we're in this phase where QE has started but it's only just started. And unfortunately when it started in 2019 Ethereum then bled back into the regression band. And so I think I have to look at a chart like this and think that there is certainly a decent chance here that Ethereum just simply bleeds back into the regression ban regardless of whether there's one more rally left in it or not. And I don't know I don't know if there is or not. I think at this point you can't keep asking those question. Those are not the right questions to be asking because this is, you know, this is more of a long-term view. A long-term this this channel exists for long-term investors, not day traders and whatnot. If Ethereum were to go back up to a new all-time high, the reality is is most people watching wouldn't sell it anyways because they would be expecting it to then go even higher. So, what I think is that when we look back on this video in a year, we'll likely see that Ethereum has spent some time in the regression band down here consolidating and preparing for the next bull market that would come after the current bare market is over. And that might involve Bitcoin going to the 200E moving average and, you know, going back below the April 2025 low. Um, it could include all of that stuff, but I just wanted to get back to the roots of of some of the things that started this channel. And one of the very first videos was this one. And I feel like the regression band worked out pretty well in predicting where the next low would be in late 2022. And you can kind of see we we drew out a potential path for Ethereum back then and in early 2020 and sort of showcased it going is this a 1,000? So 2 3 4. Yeah. Right around where it ended up going actually. Um and then kind of back down into the regression band. What was wrong about this this model was that I I just sort of assumed that we would just go straight into the regression band and then stay there. But that's not what happened, right? Instead, we stayed just above it or years as Bitcoin went up and then we've only just started going back down into it. So, that is where I think we currently are, right? That's where I think we currently are. Um, you know, we're we're probably in, you know, sort of like this phase right here where we're just kind of bleeding after QT ends and people are just kind of waiting for the next phase of the cycle to begin."

Um, you know, we're we're probably in, you know, sort of like this phase right here where we're just kind of bleeding after QT ends and people are just kind of waiting for the next phase of the cycle to begin. Unfortunately, I think that this phase of the cycle is just going to end up being sort of the latter half of the bare market. I mean, you could already argue that Ethereum's been in a bare market since August, right? So, if that's the case, it's already been in a bare market for several months. Um, and and you know, if you if you actually overlay a bar pattern from just simply say like the 2019 high, I guess you can exclude the pandemic, but if you if you just kind of overlay that over here, it, you know, it's just kind of like a slow bleed, right? Just a sort of slow bleed out. Um, and it just simply might take some time in order for things to more durably turn around. I will say this, if if somehow Ethereum does wick to a new all-time high before going into the regression band, I I actually think that would be a more bearish outcome long term because I think if it does this, if it goes up, it would then likely come crashing down to new lows because I think everyone would just be like, \"Okay, we're done with we're done with this after after this entire consolidation period.\" I think it'd be a lot healthier at this point to just kind of consolidate in here um and then kind of come out of it into the next bull market. And the good news is that in the next bull market for Ethereum, the regression ban will have fully caught up and furthermore, we'll be more than likely in the lower interest rate QE QE phase. I mean, we're already in the QE phase, but it's just not enough. But you can see when Ethereum exited the regression band during that phase, it had a much more impressive rally. This rally right here that we just had looks a lot more like 2019 to me, right? Look at that. I mean, it's it's the same sort of level of just, you know, sort of just barely barely coming out of the regression band and then going right back down. I think there's a lot to be said about about this idea. And the other thing that I've mentioned is that 2100 on Ethereum is is a number that I think will print in 2026. And what's interesting is that it corresponds to the low from April of 2025. But as we get into early 2026, 2100 is going to correspond to the fair value of Ethereum. Now, if you're an ETH maxi, you're going to think the fair value is a lot higher. But the reality is that this regression band has been a pretty good indicator of actually identifying where the true fair value is. Whenever we get too elevated, we just go back down to it, right? We just go back down to the fair value. And sometimes we we were Ethereum is stubborn and it doesn't want to go down there, but it just keeps going down there. And you could argue that in order for a true bull market to occur, for Ethereum to go durably much higher to even say like the coveted five figure mark, the regression band ultimately has to catch up. I think what a lot of people are are you know what a lot a lot of what has happened is that people overestimate what will happen in the short term and they underestimate what will happen in the long term. Imagine a scenario where Ethereum just kind of slowly bleeds into the regression band and then just hangs out here in 2026. By the end of 2026, who's left, right? Who's left? Perhaps after after all that, then you can truly start to to begin a a bowl that can take us much higher."

Perhaps after after all that, then you can truly start to to begin a a bowl that can take us much higher. But I do wonder if if that's sort of the destiny that Ethereum is is is looking at here is just sort of a slow bleed into the regression band. If you get a divergent high, I don't think it's going to last long. Uh something like that and then sort of eventually coming out of it into, you know, into the next bull market. And that's kind of how I would look at this, right? That's how I would look at this. You can see that if you were to I wonder if we have it here on the um on the website. I I imagine we do, but I don't fully know. Uh I don't remember. Here we go. Ethereum. Yeah. So, you can see it right here. And if you look at the price divided by the non-bubble price, you can see that this the extension from the regression band in in 2025 matches that extension from the regression band in 2019 almost perfectly. Almost perfectly. So base case for me is Ethereum spends some time in the regression band throughout 2026. I can't, you know, I can't keep wondering or speculating if another if another high is going to come. I mean, the only way it's going to come in 2026 is if in early 2026, Bitcoin gets like a counter trend rally back up to 100K and the E Bitcoin valuation goes to 0.053. Like, if that happens, then yeah, it's possible. But if you're a longer term investor, you know, not really too concerned about short-term moves, I think that 2026 will ultimately offer some good entries into Ethereum. Of course, that's not financial advice, but that is what I expect to happen. And then I expect better days in the next market cycle. So, we'll wrap it up there. That'll be my final video of 2025. Going back to the roots of how this channel began all those years ago in 2019. And back then we launched the channel. We just watched the asset bleed for a while and then about a year and a half later everything changed. I think it might all happen again. We're just in the bleeding phase for now. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and again, check out the sale on into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse.com. Link is in the description below, the pin comment or the QR code on the screen. We also have the direct access option as well that we recently launched. And so, make sure you guys check that out as well as we actually have a new website uh benjaminc.com for those who are interested in um reaching out uh at a different level for like speaking or anything like that. But anyways, we'll wrap it up there. Thank you guys for tuning in and I will see you next time. Bye."
