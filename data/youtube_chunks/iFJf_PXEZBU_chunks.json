      "text": "Check. Check. All right, we're live. What's up, guys? The trenches are so freaking hot. Today, we're going to look at some of the runners that have been calling, some of the runners that could probably be next because the penguin meta is hot. So, I want to talk primarily about the penguin meta, but about other metas as well. There's Listen, the trenches are so hot right now. If you're not making money, you're probably doing something wrong. So, it's my role to help you out figure out what to actually buy in the trenches because there's a lot of things going on, a lot of noise, but if you're looking in the right places, you're probably making money right now. One of the places is obviously my private group, but we're going to talk about it later because there's still a lot of things that are at a very good entry and are probably going to send back higher. Okay, so I want to start obviously talking about the freaking penguin like the main runner. If you are in my group, you found it at 155K. Even in my free Telegram, which you can find linked down in description, I think I called it something like 1 million. It just touched 90 million. So even this scorecard right now is updated. It's unbelievable to be completely honest. Like I couldn't expect I was expecting this to be a big trend, but not this way. Obviously, the White House just posted about it and I can't front run the White House. I cannot know about this, but it's just insane. Let me know down in the comments also any tickers that you want me to look at. I made a post. If you're not following Max, drop me a follow. I put this post saying, \"Show me some tickers in the comments. I'll take a look during the live stream.\" This is still open, by the way. just put the the CAS that you're buying right now. I want to hear from you and I'm going to take a direct look at some of the tickers. So, obviously some of them I still have them on my screen. Some of them I've been heavily working for the bags of my community. I like this Pingo. Uh honestly, if you think about it, the penguin meta is hot and pingu is like the OG penguin that everybody knows. Speaks a freaking universal language. To me, it's just like a no-brainer that it bonds. There's a lot of PVP between different penguin tokens, but I do want to say that in my opinion, this is like the best one because you can see that there's a very solid community on it. Um, yeah, to in my opinion, it's going to send because of that because the community is very active and it's not just me. There's a lot of other big guys that are posting in there. So, I think it's worth a bet. It's 40K. Obviously, do your own research. I'm not telling you to buy anything. I'm in this full disclosure. And, uh, it's very close to bonding, 95%. So, let's see if it bonds soon. I was in this one that Capsi was buying a second ago, funny enough. And uh it's Skyscraper. It's Skyscraper. I called it earlier. And let's see the community. Let's see the community. So So this guy is called Alex Hanold and it goes live on Netflix in eight in eight hours, something like that. So this guy is going to climb Taipe Financial Center. that was before the brush khalif I think it was like the tallest building in the world or something like that so this guy is going on Netflix live to climb it in my opinion it's just like a no-brainer of a sender obviously he migrated already it retraced and in my opinion it's just like at a good level so let's see the community is quite active I'm probably going to start posting in the community I didn't post myself in the community but I see some guys that I know that I'm posting let's see about that given that it's like listen usually this kind of ticker are sell the news events. But given that the news is actually like eight hours away, I think it's still like extremely extremely early to buy something like this. This is why I bought it. Being with 35K, let me know down in the live chat. Let me know down in the live chat what you guys want me to to take a look at."

Being with 35K, let me know down in the live chat. Let me know down in the live chat what you guys want me to to take a look at. Let me know also here on the post on X. I'm going to just put like I'm just going to take a look at all of the CAS that I find. Okay? Okay, I'm just going to try to take a look at everything. Okay, I said the Pingo. People bullish on Pingu. What's up? What's up, Will? The most famous penguin of them all is Pingu. I would agree. Yeah, let's let's cook. Let's cook. Also, if you guys Oh, I also have another one. I also have another one. Full disclosure, I did already at like a 15x in my group. Maybe even a 20x right now. I'm going to grab it right now. This is like one of the in most insane cooks that I've seen in a while. I had like very very clean conviction. I posted about this last night. Unbelievable. So, you know this met about bags, right? That that everybody is just like, \"Oh, what is this guy going to claim fees, etc., etc.\" Well, this guy is actually claiming fees. So for all the haters that are here that don't even understand the trenches that they're like, \"Oh, I'm not going to claim fees because otherwise it's a rug on my community.\" I'm not going to say anything, but I'm just going to say look at this chart. I think that the community is making a lots of money. Far boy, this guy, this guy's um an Australian artist that made this saga about uh you know, kids that fart, whatever. think it's pretty cool because he's directly on boarded and if you go on X he's actually directly on boarded in the community of this. So this guy Adam Wallace it's this guy quick visit to join and say hello before heading out 204 members when I joined it was like 40 or something like that. So this is just a clear testament that when a narrative is strong and um when uh the actual artist, content creator, you name it, whatever it is, actually joins a community, this is the things that happen like coins just go parabolic. And this is exactly what is happening with Far Boy. So, honestly, it's a very good cause because this guy said that he wanted to donate $100,000 to charity and uh the team is directly in touch with them. The guy is in the community himself and um I think that they're going to use something like 75% of the creator fees to be donated to charity and they're aiming to achieve this 100k goal. very good cause and this is also why I don't think they're just like extracting it's not necessarily extracting money from the trenches when it comes to like creator fees um when it comes to bags these are used being used for a good cause it's all in the community check it out we're going to take a look later but yeah very very bullish on this pingo is having a bit of a dip people cheating [ __ ] the cheat bro okay to you that are shing peaches says, \"Okay, first of all, I think it's absolutely outrageous that people expect me to shield a coin just because I shielded once.\" Um, and I'm going to tell you what, there's one [ __ ] that to you, if you're watching, you're absolutely stupid. Like, look at that. This guy bought 17% of the supply of peaches. If you expect me to even remotely consider the idea of buying this coin when it's when you bought 17% of the supply to probably dump on my call or dump on my shield. Uh I hope that this goes to zero."

If you're still holding peaches, I generally hope that it goes to zero and this guy loses money because this is not the way that you treat the trenches or whatever. Like what the hell? He bought 3.63. Well, I hope it goes to zero. If you guys want a cabal cabal, I don't care if you lose money. Like, you've been warned. You're basically donating money to this guy that bought 17% of the supply. It's literally all that I'm going to say to you. I don't know if it's you or whatever, but if you just pal speeches one one more time, you probably got banned. Slow man, what's up, bro? Skyscraper looking good. I have a bag in this. Full disclosure. I think it goes higher. I mean, it needs to go higher. Like, imagine if Netflix put some more teasers or something like that. Let's see. People are quite bullish on ping. Love to see that. I'm holding. I'm holding. Farboy official. My dad just bought the coin. Your dad is a trencher. I mean, that's bullish. Uh, my dad probably doesn't even know what a memecoin is. Oh, vapor. Vapor was another very, very good call. I'm still holding a moon in Vapor 244K. So, first of all, I want to give a shout out to Kroshi that put this on my radar. Another very good YouTuber, KL. Make sure to give him a follow. Um, this makes more sense than the majority of crypto out there. At the end of the day, there's so many tokens that are maybe like AI that are just like recycled GitHub pages that just don't have any sort of credible use cases. Vaporware sort of adds up everything that crypto that the transes are for 90% of it which is utter [ __ ] Vapor wear. So vapor is actually one of the coins that as a paradox that makes the most sense of them all. You look at a website it's absolutely nothing. Everything is incriptive is vaporware. That's exactly like it. I think that even a 5-year-old can understand this meta to be completely fair. So yeah very bullish. What's up, Lee? What's up? What's up? Feel bullish on Vapor. Vapor, no vapor. Don't miss out the ticker though. UID. Oh, there's a giveaway for Bit Unix. So, let's see if you guys are eligible. Let's see. Let's see if you are, brother. Going to tell you immediately. Need to refresh my data. I'll get going to get back to you guys. When live right now, bro, is it urgent? Yeah, it's actually urgent. Like there's so many things to look at in the trenches right now that is actually urgent. Not sure why Ping is dropping. Do you guys not like it? I don't know what to say. Maybe there's a lot of like PvP. Maybe it's because of that. There's a lot of PvP. Obviously, when when you shield when you buy or whatever, when when you're aping something like that and you see a lot of tickers, a lot of people are going to be demoralized because, hey, why not this ticker? Why not that ticker? To me, I try to I try to look at facts and uh to be completely frank, if there's a lot of PVP, I know that I'm just like going to incur a risk if I'm trading something like that. But let's see. Which coins are Look at the entirety of the live stream. You're going to find a lot of coins. Is banter dead? No. What? Punch penguins. I mean, punchy penguins is like the meta that started that started it all with all the sort of penguins. So, punchy penguins, yes, but it's already in the building."

So, what I try to preach at least with with the things that I trade, etc., It's just like find the things that are much lower in market cap because to do a 2x with something like punch penguins it needs to go to like well from one building to two billion in market cap. If you buy something like I don't know pingo just to to name one that is like 20k to do a 2x it needs to go to 40k which takes absolutely nothing okay to move something like that. So obviously you're also going to probably invest with a different type of sizing. It all depends on your risk tolerance. But here I'm a bit of a DJ. Obviously, if you follow my course, if you follow my Telegram, you see that I buy a lot of things that are like very low in market cap. But even this penguin thing that obviously I bought it when I bought it was 155k market cap. Then it went to 90 million. So even things that go so up, you can still find them early or you join an alpha group like my and you're going to get my alerts and you're going to make a lot of money. Farboy, I called it last night. did already a 15x. This thing went 500x. So, if you're not in there, I don't know what to tell you. If you like money, you probably want to join. If you don't like money, if you're just there complaining, oh, I can't make money, blah blah blah, then I mean, don't join. You're a loser. But if you want to make money, that's the place that you're going to be. It's going to be linked down in description such as every link um on every social, everything. All right. Check out RAW. Uh I traded RAW a little while ago. I think it did absolutely nothing. I know it's viral on Tik Tok, so it could still pump, but I'm not exactly sure. You know what? I think it could be the next RAW. I'm going to show you. I saw this thing. I wish I could show you the I wish I could show you the video, but I don't think I can because I don't have audio from my Chrome. But anyway, is this fun? You probably saw it. If you guys are looking into like trends on Tik Tok, I saw this thing. Look at this video. It's absolutely hilarious. So, there's basically like this uh this conversation from this chick that says, \"Oh, this is my life is so hard.\" And then there's a veteran saying that he he's um yeah, whatever. I'm not going to spoiler it, but it's hilarious. Check it out. This is the ticker. You want to check it out? 386 and he veteran a man scream with no lungs. This is viral and everywhere on Tik Tok. Ra was also one the banking scar like that was also like very viral um it didn't really catch bits everything is vapor where I agree sell the spike in what was the pingo ca it's this one brother at least the one that I'm talking about is this one BB VF7 AK Okay. If it's if you're the one with 17%, I mean, you're stupid. So, it's not that I'm mad. I probably made way more money than you because you're at a loss. It's crazy. How can I be mad? I I'm like the top trader in that coin and you are just like buying 20% of a coin that is like 17k market cap. Mink of the cycle vaporware. Oh, Kroshi is here, bro. Is this the the actual profile? What's up, bro? I think it can be the mink of the Yes, sir. Okay, let's see how my trade skyscraper is going."

Is Capsi still holding? Bro, this might be the first time that I see Capsi holding a coin. I'm not even joking. What? Capsi is not selling. I'm not going to say anything, but if Capsi is not selling a memecoin, weird as [ __ ] Check Ustream. Give me a CA. Okay, let's take a look. May Maybe it's another ticker this one. Oh, did the guy dump it? He dumped it. Oh, I was jealous, right? Oh my god. BW4. Why can't I cop it? I'm trying to cop it, bro. Can't copy it from here. You need to put like just a CA, I think. Uh, okay. Do do one thing, brother. Hate Mighty Gaming. drop it in my tweet. Drop it on my tweet and I'm going to be able to copy and paste it because like this I can't copy and paste it because I'm just using like Streamyard. Okay, let's take some Let's take a look at some of the plays here. Okay, skyscraper. I've already taken a look at it. Very bullish. If Caps is holding probably knows something. Layer node. What is this? Layer node is posting Farboy. partway to the moon. Can you guys believe that I I've called this at like 60k is now 700. I've already gave my thesis. Uh you can also expect a video on far probably tomorrow on my personal YouTube channel. My personal YouTube channel is also linked down description. If you're not subbed, what are you doing again? This is alpha. This was alpha. This was actual alpha. Who the hell is making this call and he goes like 15k immediately? Damn, bro. What is the difference between your paid group versus your public post? Um, obviously, as you can imagine, my paid group gets things earlier because they paid me for they pay me for my services, which are getting early alpha, then I post publicly. That is pretty much the paid group of every single person in crypto. It's not just mine. So, if you want to, if you're willing to spend more and invest in yourself, get in and you're going to make it back with literally one single trade. Like, people got my Farboy call yesterday. He did a 15x yesterday and people can attest in the comments. So, guys from my group, let me know how much you printed down in the comments. Show your support, guys. I think that you need to post it. I don't know how to freaking paste it from here. Yeah, you gota just put it here. Black whale, bro. The the narrative is dead. Like, why would you buy a net narrative? Ray talked about what is vaporware. The man in cell. What's up, brother? Send me soul. Uh, I don't give soul to beggars. You can follow the cause and make money, my friend. 10k of wall the penguin I wouldn't top blast now I it's just to give context really you know what I'm saying okay let's see the comments here people are bullish on pingu people are bullish on vapor on far boy yo daddy I don't know which which one this is let's take a look okay also don't show me 4k 4K toppers. Why the hell would I show a 4K topper? I'm not going to buy a 4K topper. Jesus. Mary Rose. Uh, I made a video on Mary Rose like ages ago. So, if you're following my YouTube channel, you probably saw it before it got big. Now, I don't know where it is right now. So, I'm going to take a look. No, it's gone, bro. It's gone. Oh yeah, this is where I made a video on M Rose. It was 1 million."

Oh yeah, this is where I made a video on M Rose. It was 1 million. It went to 14, but now it's completely dead. This is actually dead for real. Look at that terrible chart. I don't know if they did relaunches or anything, but I'm just not interested. I don't think the narrative is like uh relevant anymore. By the way, the this is a beautiful consolidation. If you guys want a tip on finding gems, first of all, find something that is extremely relevant. find take a look at the distribution see if it's actually like um a good distribution and um yeah if if you see like big KOS big traders that are holding a chart that is with a good distribution and also um also with like a catalyst event of the meta itself. So for instance this guy is like climbing one of the world's tallest skyscrapers tonight and it's going on Netflix. Netflix literally put a post about it. I'm not even in the community. So, let me join to me. It's incredibly bullish. Yeah, it's today. So, it was to supposed to be yesterday, but for the weather, they postponed to today. So, it's today at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. I mean, Eastern as well. So, it's in uh 6 hours and a half. Incredible. like infinitely minimal. Yeah, I'm gonna repost this. I love it. Work for your handbags. Yeah, this is all I need to put. It's crazy. Let's put the CA. I guess the PVP got to pingo to be honest. 19K. Let's see. I mean, if it floors here, there's still a chance of like recovery, but depends if people like this one more than than other ones really. Skyscraper in my opinion. You see when you see like a chart consolidating than a dip that gets eaten in my opinion just like Yeah. In fact, it's like pumping. Like, it's just so B it's just too bullish of a concept to to just let go of. It's just too bullish. I personally really really like this a lot. So, yeah, we'll see. We'll see what happens. Inside of knowledge before the rest. I think that predicting trends can even be like more profitable than uh insider knowledge because at the end of the day I don't think that at 100k anybody had insider knowledge on on the penguin but I thought that the trend was strong and I was like [ __ ] the penguin matter can be something real especially big accounts start posting about it and the video was viral the video of the penguin so yeah you you can't really have insider knowledge on something that goes 1,000 eggs you can have insider knowledge on plenty of things, but that's not one of it, guys. Scraper CA. I mean, it's the one that you see on the screen. So, I'm just going to zoom in. It's this one that starts with FT FA MWG that one. The Nissan Penguin is rocking. Let's see what it is right now. Oh my god. 112. Have I just called a 10,00x team? Can Can you please give me my scorecard? My updated scorecard. Holy. For the record, I sold everything. I'm not I'm not in this anymore. I sold relatively early to what it actually has become. I cannot believe like whoa 110. It was like at 80 before I started the live stream. Jesus. Oh my god. 721x. They're telling me 721x. 721x. Wow. By the way, if you guys are thinking, how is it possible they pump so that much? The White House has been bull posting about this yesterday. They put po more posts. They put more posts. They not only they put a post yesterday with Trump and the penguin, which by the way went super viral. 12484K likes, 41 million impressions. They put another one, bro. Unreal. Unreal."

Guys, congrats if you're making money on this. If not, I'm honestly not sorry because I've been stressing for days now. Even if you saw it at like 10 million, you would have made 11x now. Honestly, I didn't think it would go this. I I thought it would go to billions and millions, but over 100 million. This is nuts. This is nuts. So this is like a clear representation that the trenches are back and money is there to be made. This is huge guys. Huge. How do we go about joining your paid group? Uh bro, you just go on uh just go here on the videoum. So you go right here in the links. Here is all of my links. Okay. So there's the private discord. So private discord this is the VIP group. This is my ex profile, my free talent group and also my personal YouTube channel. And also I have a big big announcement. So tomorrow, no not tomorrow, but from next week I'm going to start the live streaming again on my personal channel again. So, this one is always going to be there, the Saturday live stream on Crystal Banther, but I'm thinking of doing like one to two live streams during the week because there's a lot that I want to talk about right now in the trenches and I feel like streams are lasting like a few days now. So, it's probably best if I go live like two or three times a week. So, let me know if this is something that you want to see, but I'm thinking of adding some live streams to my personal schedule. All right. Um, yeah, these are all the resources. The best time to promote a coin. Promote, I don't even know if that's the word. I mean, it's just like buying and saying the bought it. Uh, is when a coin has a good distribution, which didn't happen, unfortunately. I just made 20k. Congrats. Peaches can compete with Poly. I agree. I mean, at the end of the day, the main characters are Pax and Poly. So, all of the other characters are sort of like derivatives, okay? So, this is also something that you need to understand. The freaking skyscraper is sending, by the way, 80K. 80K, bro. 80K. I wouldn't be surprised if this goes like to very big. And Capsi is still holding. I swear to God, I'm not kidding. This is the first time that I see Capsi holding a coin. And even capsi doesn't have a good entry. The entry of capsi is like 66k market cap. I have a better entry than capsi. My entry is something like 40. It's around here 40. Let's see. Man, I'm really interesting. Oh, they're just telling me that they they just sent me a DM that they paid a 50x boost on Vapor. That's bullish. That's bullish. 50x boost. GG. GG. Honestly, Vapor has been consolidating a lot. People in my group got this at 40K in the market cap. Full disclosure, we printed very, very hard. It did almost a 10x from my call. But yeah, I mean, it's consolidating. The chart is incredibly bullish."

And even capsi doesn't have a good entry. The entry of capsi is like 66k market cap. I have a better entry than capsi. My entry is something like 40. It's around here 40. Let's see. Man, I'm really interesting. Oh, they're just telling me that they they just sent me a DM that they paid a 50x boost on Vapor. That's bullish. That's bullish. 50x boost. GG. GG. Honestly, Vapor has been consolidating a lot. People in my group got this at 40K in the market cap. Full disclosure, we printed very, very hard. It did almost a 10x from my call. But yeah, I mean, it's consolidating. The chart is incredibly bullish. So we had like this big big run up then a big dump obviously of people taking profits and right now it's just like ranging in this area you know so as long as it keeps like ranging here I think that the next leg up could be loading so it could be a good idea to accumulate right now it's looking very very good in my opinion holy [ __ ] 100k damn bro 100k We're printing. We're printing once again. Let's go. Let's go. Are you guys in? I hope you guys are in. Not even copsy selling. Damn. Would love to see more streams. Then make sure to tune in also on my personal YouTube channel. Going to go live on Banter every single week on Saturdays. And uh on my personal channel, I'm thinking something like Wednesday for sure. or maybe I do like Tuesday and Thursday. We'll see. We'll see from next week. Just stay tuned because obviously I'm going to put the announcement in um um on my free Telegram. So on my free Telegram, I always put like my schedule when I go live and when I don't go live. Clickbait garbage. I mean, you probably are sidelineed on every single one of my calls. I'm sorry. And I hope that you start printing like everybody here. I think after Penguin Ra might be next. Can somebody give me the the the CA of RAW here on this post on X? Okay, let let's do something so I can actually find it. Let's see if I can find uh banging. Yeah, it's this one. Okay. Can somebody please put a CA of RAW to this post that I'm putting right here? So, I take a look. Okay. Drop the CA and I'm going to take a look. Drop it here. Bring it to me money. I'm happy, bro. Twinkle. Twinkle, which one is it? This one? Is it this one? The hell is this shark? What? Oh, it looks weird, bro. I'm not sure if it's this one. Commit is active, I think. No, the commit is not really active. I'm not sure if this is the one you meant. You didn't put like a CA 100x boost on poly. Really? It's pumping back up. It's looking good. This chart, I gotta say that this chart is weird. But yeah, I don't personally know the team. I don't know who's behind this. If the team is watching this, I would love to get in touch because obviously I've been in touch with the PAX team. I know that they're very committed, but I don't know anything about this one. So, it's a bit of a shot in the dark for me. Um, where is Pax right now? Pax is also sending. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. P sending. I love P. Obviously, Pax is like the main play of all the metal, the Das of Punch Penguins. 40% up in the last hour. It's looking really good, guys. It's looking really really good. So, yeah, we'll see. But in right now, it's looking really, really good. What's the coin I'm talking about? A lot. Zora. Zora is the the creator coin on uh base. No, I mean it's 139 million. Even the volume is really low. Like, can you give me like one good reason why I should buy it? I'm going to listen to you, but I have no idea why I should buy this. I don't think I I would buy it, but if you give me a good reason, maybe I'm going to take a look. Got no idea. Were they telling me? Oh, vapor is sending there. Yeah, they were just telling me that Vapor is sending. Yeah, Vapor is sending. Damn. What the [ __ ] I guess you you guys really like Vapor."

Yeah, they were just telling me that Vapor is sending. Yeah, Vapor is sending. Damn. What the [ __ ] I guess you you guys really like Vapor. Yeah, Plex was just telling me Vapor is sending. Yeah, I'm sure you like the chart, bro. What the hell? What was those buys? What were those buys? Somebody bought like 12 souls. Damn. You like vapor. You like vapor, guys. I can see it. Let's see how my skyscraper trade goes. I took my initial. The rest that I had to take. Let's see. But I'm still going to keep a very large moon because capsi is not selling. If capsi doesn't sell, I'm going to keep this. Vapor is flying. I do like veteran. I mean it went super viral. I mean to me this is like criminally undervalued and the dro how's the dro? Look even lin look at lfork. He hasn't sold a single token. Lindfork is my quant. So, if Linkorg doesn't sell anything, to me, this is like incredibly bullish because he thinks that it can go much higher. Aura, no, your message is here, bro. But I have like dozens of messages to read. I'm not going to read everything immediately. Aura. Um I I mean, that's funny. I don't think I saw this before. See G bought it. I mean not today. 500K. How's the volume is quite me? But it's holding the floor. So that's quite bullish. See the community. Ah, okay. I get it. So, it's like um a blend of like all the characters. So, Mudang the hippo, pin the squirrel, shea army, and uh cat ears. What's the cat runner though? Whatever. Oh my god. AI is getting out of control, right, guys? Um, yeah. I mean, it's funny. I like it. I like it. But um yeah, I don't know. It's already 500k like realistically where it can go. Like this big insider that I have sold everything at the top. Um if I had found this at the very beginning, I would have probably bought a lot. But I think that it's sad these days. It's very funny though. I'll give you that. You know what's also like on a very good dip? Oh boy. My god. Can you believe that? I called this at what did I call it? 60K. 60. I called this at 60K. So, over a 15x. Insane. Right now, it's on a bit of a dip. Buys are coming in. Will it keep going higher? I don't know. But I'm still holding some because I think it could. So, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Obviously, I took initial. Obviously took profits. Farboy going to millies now. It can. It certainly can. I mean, if it went from 100K to 900K in just uh less than one hour, it can definitely go to the millions. Vapor to alltime high soon. I mean, Vapor is definitely looking nice, guys. Vapor is looking good. Vapor is looking good. Even Bastil was trading here. By the way, this is not my full wallet tracker. It's just like a sample with some wallets, some of the most famous ones. Some of them are on KL Scan. The the full list of my wallet tracker, I give it to my private uh Discord. So, if you're in my private Discord, I have a section called tools. And there I have like uh the full wallet tracker. And obviously, this is not my wallet because I don't have zero salon on my wallet. I have a little more. It's just like um you know a dummy because if people see everything here they're they're going to start copy trading and uh I don't want people to copy trade me. They can I mean I have a doc wallet but I yeah I'm not the kind of guy to just like look for copy traders to dump on them. I don't care. Check repos. All right. Let's see if you guys put the CA."

All right, let's take a look. Holy, this is not the one I traded though. Let me check on my personal wallet. No, I did not trade this. I did not trade this one. I traded I traded another RAW. Oh well. Oh well. I seems like I missed it. So you see even once again I was not wrong. I was just early cuz I remember trading one but it's not the one that sent. And sometimes it happens bros. Like sometimes there's too much PVP and I happen to buy one and it's not the one that officially sets. 1 million has a lot of volume still. It doesn't have a lot of volume, but the volume that is coming in is like insane buys. Like look at that. $900. Donald calls. Who the hell is that? The chart looks good, not going to lie. Yeah, probably because iron. Yeah. So, I reiterate I I change my statement. I was not aware that there was one in the millions. I I saw a lot of PvP when they were being first being pushed, but this is just insane. GG. I faded this one. I missed it. Will, what's up? What's up? What's up? Vapor CA. I had it on my screen a second ago, but let me get it back. Is this one GRL for this one, right? Just type Vapor on your Axium. By the way, if you guys are looking for for trading bots, um I mean, right now there's a very good offer with Trojan. I would recommend Trojan because there's um there's $50 that you get at sign up. Um, you can use axim, you can use padre, you can use troan, whatever. My referral link is sepil is at sepriel for every single trading bot, but right now I think that the best one is tro because out of all of them uh is the only one that is giving 45% cash back. So if you're looking to like save a little bit on fees and get cash back, 45% is insane and you also get $50 for free at registration. So yeah, I would check it out. Uh, also Bit Ununix for pers. I'm going to give away uh $2,000 in discounts and training fees to four lucky people. So, there was two people that put Thanks. Okay, so here's the winners. I have two more spots. So, if you drop your UIDs and you deposited at least $1,000, you're going to be eligible. If you didn't put at least $1,000, even if I select you, you're not going to win. Okay. So, the first one is this guy that I can't pronounce the name. Congrats. You won. Uh, so yeah, you're just going to see it on your account if you have deposited more than $1,000. If you haven't, the team is going to check and you're not going to get it. All right, I hope it makes sense. So, you're the first one. Let me take a picture. One, Gisha, you're the second. Congrats. two more. And again, Bitunix is what I'm using for per trade. There's been insane per calls as well. Like if you look at the at my telegram, even even when there's no volume in the trenches, which is obviously not today, but even when there's no volume in the trenches, there's um there's always opportunities to make money. So obviously here you can see all the calls that I've been making this week. But we made a a Bitcoin short. Where is it? Uh where's the Bitcoin short that we did? Let me find it. I've been pretty just too much in the trenches at the hour. So, this was the Bitcoin short for instance. And this is also what you got in the VIP group. It's not just me coins."

Obviously, MCO right now are the the hottest things, but there's also per trades that we're doing and they're going absolutely parabolic. So, we got the Yeah, just look at that. We had a 93k entry and obviously BTC went to almost 87. So, you would have printed a lot. Okay, two more winners. All right, Banana Republic, congrats. Another one for another $500. By the way, it's trading bonus that gets deducted from your fees. So, basically, you're going to be um without fees up to $500. I hope it makes sense. Okay, to the next one that pulls the UAD is going to be the winner. First come, first serve basis. Yeah, the plays are looking good. I guess Bingo got too much PvP. Whatever. I'm still holding some, but yeah, see what happens. Skyscraper looks good. This is a beautiful chart. I mean, look at the chart. It's freaking beautiful. Freaking beautiful. Insane. So, yeah, obviously I'm showing Axium. You can sign up to my Axiom. It's Sapprial as a referral code or check out Trojan or check out Padre. It's the referral is going to be separal for both of them. Yeah, let's see. Like the trenches are super hot, so I'm going to go back to scanning in a second. But yeah, RA looking good. Looking really, really good. So many cooks, guys. Honestly, there there's just too much in the trenches right now. So, yeah, we'll see. We'll see. Okay, the stream time is up. So, I hope to see you guys in the VIP group because we're making just so much money. would be a shame if you're if you if you're not in there, you know, like we're printing, so join us and print with us. I'll catch you on the next one on every Saturday at 1 p.m. Eastern. I'm here on CryptoBanner. And also subscribe to my personal channel because there's going to be videos and live streams coming next week. I'll see you next time. Ciao."
