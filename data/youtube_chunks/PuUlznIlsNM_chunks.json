      "text": "Happy Saturday, guys. Yes, Saturday stream. I \nwanted to jump on today. I am seeing a bunch   of altcoins, specifically 10 altcoins, breaking \nweekly trends. And for me, these are entries,   specifically high time frame, that I do \nnot want to miss. You know, ultimately,   we're always looking for short-term gains. We \nneed to pay attention to the best high time frame   opportunities. And I'm sticking to a formula, \nyou know, of looking at where is the market   emotionally and where are the very key trends \nthat we are breaking. You know, end of the day,   when we're coming down sideways, bunch of red \nemotions, bunch of depressing emotions. But   the moment you start popping through the other \nside, the key is to get entries before the green   emotions start to come in. Because when green \nemotions start to come in, the first push is   a little bit not really believable. The second \none, people start to believe it. The third one,   they really start to believe it. That's why you'll \ntend to see pumps start slowly and then really   start to rampage up. But the key is to catch it \nbefore those green emotions come into play. The   key is to get entries so that we are not sitting \nand trying to chase pumps later on looking for   entries. The next thing as well is to stick to the \nformula, right? Is to only buy and build positions   when these structures are being broken. So right \nnow you're sitting with a market where 50% of   altcoins are still not breaking structure, okay? And certain amounts of altcoins are starting to   break structure. And therefore, when you see pumps \nstart as a whole or markets resetting as a whole,   you'll always see certain altcoins lead the race. Okay? And the important thing is to move where the   strength is. When the rest of the altcoins start \nto get strong, that's when we pay attention to   them. But as I see things now, there's only \na handful of alts that I am seeing that are   actually in buy zones. And these are altcoins that \nI want to bring to your attention today. So yes,   the key is markets have been a little bit \ndepressing, a little bit sad. So let's do   more shows. Let's see each other more often. Let's \ntrade and prepare charts even more. And when the   market is slowing down and everyone's flaking \nout of crypto, we are going to continue to work   harder and again make 2026 the best year of our \nlives. So do me a favor, hit the like button,   hit the subscribe button. Let's get vibes \ngoing nice and strong and let's start the   damn show. Let's go. I try and help everyone in \nmy space and this is what I get. I try and fight. Fam. How are we all doing? Your brand channel. Hit \nthe subscribe button. Get the likes flying through   the roof. So, I have a quite a bit of trades \nfor you guys today. Specifically, long-term   trades. And I do have some short-term trades \nof some altcoins breaking structure right now. Now again guys, when it comes to markets moving, \nsometimes it can take a little bit of time,   right? Specifically the start, right? We always \nsay that the start is the hardest and the start is   the slowest and then things start to speed up nice \nand aggressively after that, right? And again,   the key here is to get the entries in the good \nlevels, get the protection zones in, and be   patient for the push to the upside. The last thing \nwe want to do after going through everything we've   gone through in the last year or so, okay, is to \nmiss the entries, right? Is to have the 100% pump   and then kind of sit and say, \"Oh, now I want to \nget back in or now I want to take advantage.\" That   is not the key here. The key here is again is to \nremember the past, work on strategies on how we   can protect capital better, but ultimately get \nback into the race. So again, let's jump through   a couple of things. Let's start off. I am in a \nSUI BitFunded long position that I'm building. Okay. The key that I'm seeing is specifically \nrecently it's been very much around this thing of,   you know, short-term kind of trades, right? And \nwhat I'm realizing is short-term is actually   getting quite difficult specifically with \nBitFunded challenges. So what I'm doing now is   I'm taking positions, okay, little bit less size, \nokay, giving myself a little bit more range and   just being patient for the move, right? Because we \nget in these little traps."

The key that I'm seeing is specifically recently it's been very much around this thing of, you know, short-term kind of trades, right? And what I'm realizing is short-term is actually getting quite difficult specifically with BitFunded challenges. So what I'm doing now is I'm taking positions, okay, little bit less size, okay, giving myself a little bit more range and just being patient for the move, right? Because we get in these little traps. But ultimately, if we   zoom out and specifically if I look at let's say \nSUI in the last little while, right? And let's go   through here quickly and jump in and show you guys \nwhy I'm very interested in SUI right now. Let's   jump in over here and show you guys. Here we go. Okay, so just let you guys know BitFunded trades   that I've just started now. SUI just started \nbreaking out the 4-hour trend. So previously   I was trading 1-hour and I've just realized that \n1-hour the market is starting to slowly change. So in December 1-hour trades were very good \nshort-term trades. Okay. And now what I'm doing   is I'm slightly moving to around the 3-day 4-day \ntrades. Okay? Because again you know for me you   got to read the room and the room is the market \nis starting to give gains a little bit slower now   and a little bit more high time frame. Now short \ntime frame can be a little bit difficult because   again when pumps start we start off a little bit \nchoppy and then we start to move through and in   this trap you know I don't want to get myself hit \ntoo many times hit too many stops get demotivated   right where all I had to do was just be patient \nright and a little bit later on that trend would   have broke right specifically the high time frame \ninstead of me wasting capital here catch the early   trade be patient or catch the the bigger break \ntrade and that is where the gains were to be. So   just to let you guys know specifically short time \nframe BitFunded I am moving a little bit slower   now okay looking for 4-hour breaks and looking \nfor strength which tokens are showing strength so   the trade that I'm in right now is SUI is what I'm \nbuilding I'm building the position outside of this   4-hour trend that we've just started to break and \nI do have stop losses around the 1.88 areas as my   stops round a percent which means I am not putting \nmassive amounts but I'm trading around 15% of my   current position sizes on BitFunded okay and again \npreviously when I'm short-term trading I'd enter   a trade now and I'll be like ah okay I'm going to \na little bit of a loss because the 1-hour mindset   process right is like I'm catching this thing now \nit's got to go now right where now it's like hey   you're buying a 4-hour break 4-hour candles take \ntime to print right put a correct stop loss in be   patient catch the bigger move right and that \nis the small shift that I'm making it's the   important thing guys that when this market starts \nto change trend you got to basically realize that   if the software of the market is starting to shift \nyou need to update your software and start to move   a little bit specifically if what you have been \ndoing has not been working so in the last 48 hours   specifically on BitFunded I went from 100,000 \nwhich is the start I went to 99 went 101 went   to 100 went to 99 went to 100 and 100,500 now back \ndown to 99. I'm like I'm wasting my like I'm not   reading the room here. Okay, it's just I'm going \nlike this. All right, so slow it down. Look at   where the opportunities are and I wake up today. Opportunities on the 4-hour charts a little bit   higher time frame. Be damn patient. Stop wasting \nyour energy and start playing a lot smarter. So my   BitFunded trade right now is SUI. Only trade \nthat I'm in. Stop loss is around the 1.8 to   1.805 areas, which means it's around a percent \nor so. And I am in 18%. Show you guys, I still   have available $80,000."

      "text": "you have been doing has not been working so in the last 48 hours specifically on BitFunded I went from 100,000 which is the start I went to 99 went 101 went to 100 went to 99 went to 100 and 100,500 now back down to 99. I'm like I'm wasting my like I'm not reading the room here. Okay, it's just I'm going like this. All right, so slow it down. Look at where the opportunities are and I wake up today. Opportunities on the 4-hour charts a little bit higher time frame. Be damn patient. Stop wasting your energy and start playing a lot smarter. So my BitFunded trade right now is SUI. Only trade that I'm in. Stop loss is around the 1.8 to 1.805 areas, which means it's around a percent or so. And I am in 18%. Show you guys, I still have available $80,000. So around 20, 18 to 20% in \nthe positions and I'm trading strength. Amazing. Again, now let's go through a couple of things \nwhy high time frame is quite important. Okay. And specifically focusing on a high time frame. I told you guys about the breakout. We did break   a trend. I do believe that this is the disbelief \npump. Okay. And again, what are we looking for? We're looking for Bitcoin to get back to the \n100, 105, $106,000 zone. We're not thinking   too far of new all-time highs. We're looking at \nwhat opportunities over the next couple of weeks   in those areas. We do have a bit of a bearish \nBitcoin dominance that has lost recent trends. And I just want to show you guys the trends that \nwe have lost. Okay, look at that. Okay, we have   lost it. We are retesting. For me, the opportunity \nand the money to be made is in altcoins and blue   chip altcoins specifically. But we are retesting \nthis trend, which means for me at any point, we   should actually see a nice push to the downside. So, if I'm looking at Bitcoin go to $100,000,   okay, which is a nice 10% 12% move from here, \nI'm looking around a 20 30% move within specific   altcoins, okay? And that's the important thing. Again, not thinking too far. When we get there,   we'll see what the next opportunity. Maybe we \nbreak 105, we go to 120, right? We will see as   it goes. Right now, entries, buying on supports, \npaying attention to strength, altcoins, when it   comes to a little bit higher, right? We do have \na big move on Bitcoin coming, you know, or a big   decision making point because are we forming some \nsort of head and shoulders, right? Are we looking   at possibly something like this and something like \nthis? Right? This is something for us to decide in   the future. Right now, the opportunity for me is \nthere. And if we see the markets bearish here,   we short the damn thing down. Right? I told you \nguys something that's very important this year,   right? Is now all of these previous I brought \nmats on by mistake. All of these previous   theories of four-year cycles, all these things \nout of the window. Now we're in the wild wild   west. We're in the ocean. No one knows where \nwe are. We are here with our survival tools. But the key thing is now no longer relying on \nalt seasons and these things to make us rich,   right? Where's the money moving? Where are \nwe going to make money? Trade it as it is and   become rich. That is where my mindset's at. That \nis where my brain's at. And that is the way I'm   going to be treating this entire year. I feel it's \nprobably the best strategy that we can ever do,   right? Is to just move where the money is going \nand no more just these presumptions again. It will   be bull markets again, right? But we don't want to \nput the pressure on that it's this specific month,   this specific year. Been there, done that, \ntick that box multiple times. Cheers. Right,   it's done. It's time to grow, right? So time to \ngrow from the past, right? Which is important. So again, I'm just looking for the opportunities \nin these areas over here. So let's go through   where I'm seeing the opportunities. The first \none is SUI, right? First one is SUI. So I want   to go through here. SUI for me is one of the \ntokens that are looking the strongest in the   market specifically right now because when I look \nat markets recovering, it gives me an opportunity   to kind of see what is the strongest, right? And \nthat's kind of where I want to move."

So again, I'm just looking for the opportunities in these areas over here. So let's go through where I'm seeing the opportunities. The first one is SUI, right? First one is SUI. So I want to go through here. SUI for me is one of the tokens that are looking the strongest in the market specifically right now because when I look at markets recovering, it gives me an opportunity to kind of see what is the strongest, right? And that's kind of where I want to move. When you look   at the whole of the altcoin market, it's oversold, \nright? Weekly stocks at the bottom. This is why   I'm saying I want to slow down to make money now \ninstead of just putting all of this pressure,   okay, on the short time frame. Just get the stock \nRSI up here quickly. Okay, I want to catch the   bigger move. So again, what I look for is I look \nfor an oversold token and I look for it exiting   the oversold areas. Okay, here oversold exiting \nmoves, right? And that's the important thing here   oversold. When it exits, we start to move, right? So, I'm looking for this specific key here of   altcoins that are starting to pop their head out \nof the oversold areas. Okay? Because it's clear   we've had a lot of red come through. The bulls \nwill reply. The next thing that I'm looking at   is a break of structure, right? As you basically \nlook here and see where is this altcoin now and   what major trends are we breaking. Okay? And that \nis that one important trend that I spoke about   previously where we have this trend. Anything to \ndo on the left-hand side is still red emotions. Anything on the right-hand side, we're starting to \ngo into green emotions. So, we had a breakout. The   first thing I wanted to see on SUI was the higher \nhigh. We have got that. Now, what I'm looking for   is the higher low and I was looking for a retest \nof support. Previous level, we broke out there and   that is exactly where we are retesting. Now, \nagain, the key is not to predict that that is   where we bounce. The key is let the chart or let \nthe token show you that the strength is incoming. So when we are coming down to retest here, I \npop in one important trend. Okay, and that is   the trend we are breaking and kitting out right \nnow as it stands. Okay, first token for me right   now is SUI. One token that's showing strength \nand a push. Now let's speak about where we are   seeing this token looking to possibly go on the \nnext push is the mid-range of where we dropped. Okay, all of these tokens for me, we are going \nto at some point have a mid-range pump. Okay,   then we will see if we are bearish for the high \ntime frame or not. Right. So from here, mid-range   pump. Again, there are many many many reasons \nwhy I'm saying this. Okay, the first one is   let's put up a big trend line. The trend line is \nmarking up to those areas. Let's put up Fibonacci   and we go from here to bottom to top. The 618 \nto 786 is sitting in these areas. We look at   resistances. There's resistance here, resistance \nhere. There are literally four to five to six. There's probably moving averages sitting in these \nareas too, right? Many areas of telling me that   this is the zone anywhere between 2.6 to the areas \nof $3 is where at some point we are looking ready   to push to. So those are my targets. And if I \nlook to risk-to-reward, right, and I look at,   okay, I want to enter this trade now. Protection \nzones are definitely under these previous daily   lows we made two days ago because remember when we \nare breaking out of a trend, okay, you that means   we should not come back in. Oh, we're starting to \nwake up here. Yes. Yes. Go. Come on. No, we need   a I need a nice strong victory here. This will be \nvery good. Okay, there's the breakout."

Protection zones are definitely under these previous daily lows we made two days ago because remember when we are breaking out of a trend, okay, you that means we should not come back in. Oh, we're starting to wake up here. Yes. Yes. Go. Come on. No, we need a I need a nice strong victory here. This will be very good. Okay, there's the breakout. So again my   protection zones on leverage positions will be at \nthat 1.8 right on spot positions will be at 1.7 to   the areas of 1.69 right take profit zones a push \nto 2.5 to 2.6, right? That is my risk-to-reward. Good trade. I'm in one of the stronger tokens \nin the market right now. Is this thing moving? Yes. Yes. Yes. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Break \nthrough this resistance and go, go, go, go, go. Okay. So, that is the first one. Let me know \nanyone that is holding SUI or think about it. Okay. Amazing. Someone says pump. Good. Nice prediction of my next token. Right. Is pump.fun. This is one of the rest. Let me \njust see here quickly. I set a budget. Nice   prediction. I know you were saying that coin must \npump but nice prediction. Nice prediction. Okay,   here we go. Okay, let's jump in. Okay, pump.fun \nas my next big token that I'm looking for a strong   push to the upside. Now again, pump.fun. One \nof the new narratives that come through. The   key is to never buy the narrative straight away \nas they come through. They still first have to   go through the validation. What's the validation? Put it under pressure. Right after sell pressure,   then it starts to rise and break trend. That's \nthe key of when we're looking to get in. Right. I do like the idea of newer tokens in the \nmarket, new tokens that are innovating,   new tokens that are bringing new concepts to the \nmarket. It's bringing a whole new stream version   to the market and could possibly be the YouTube \nof crypto, right? A new way for content creators   to make money. But again, the concept is cool, \nright? But ultimately, is it showing strength on   the chart? Is it breaking structure and yes it \nis. This is a token that has now broken out of   trends okay has now retested okay and for me is \ngetting ready for a upside push okay so entries   for me on this token is 0.002 to 0.0024, right? If again, you got a choice here. Okay, Sheldon,   does that mean I can leverage the life out of \nthis thing? All comes down to risk, right? So,   for me specifically, this is a higher time frame \nview. We got Maddie in the chat over there. We got   the other Matt, Aussie Matt, right? Please, can \nwe launch a pump.fun bot, please, brother? Okay,   thank you. Let's launch a pump.fun bot. Anyone \nwho wants to see the pump.fun bot, you will find   it in the description. Let me show you quickly. Okay, we are just going to launch more and more   and more bots. So, in the description over here, \nlet's go through. You will see the bots. There's   the link if you want to see all of the bots. Okay, you will see a pump.fun bot if you want   a bot section over there. But, nonetheless, spot \nentries for me. If I want to leverage this thing,   I zoom in a little. Okay, I look at a break of \ntrend. It actually did already break trend. Look   at that broke trend. Okay. So, if you wanted to \nenter this, it would not be a super high leverage   trade right now. It's very much a spot entry to a \nlow leverage right now. If it decides to do this,   this is a short time frame and you can catch \nit over there with a tighter stop. That could   be a little bit higher leverage. Nonetheless, \nthere's a lot of money to be made to the upside. You don't have to high leverage everything. I know it's desperation to make money back,   but just keep aware. This for me is one of the \nbig opportunities right now is pump.fun. Where   am I seeing us go?"

Where is that? Mid-range. Mid-range. That is where I'm looking at the opportunity. Okay, the next one is Grandma ETH, right? Yes. E, E, E, E, E. I don't care. For me,   ETH is still one of the plays and a token that I'm \nvery much interested in. Let's go here. Let's show   you where my ETH position is. There we go. Okay. For me, ETH is at the point where if you look at   market structure, emotions of the markets, very \nmuch into disbelief, very much looking to go into   hope next, right? Depression phase push. Now, \nit's a little bit earlier than the rest of the   tokens. It has not broke the top structures just \nyet. But where I like and why I like ETH right   now is where the risk aspect is to buy this token, \nright? The risk aspect is quite important for me   here. And it's quite an obvious if we are bullish \nnow, right? And we're looking for this push at any   point here. And I look at risk here and I look \nat the big bottom trends here. This for me has   come straight into support. Okay. And a good zone \nto accumulate. Now, this zone is anywhere between   $3,000 to $3,100. That's my accumulation \nzone for ETH. Very much a spot position,   very much a bot position. And this is why just to \nshow you guys here, we do have the bot positions   on ETH. Okay, there's my ETH, okay, that we are \nbusy building over here as well as spot. Where   am I seeing ETH go from here? I am seeing ETH at \nany point make a rally back to $3,700 to $3,900. Okay, so ETH for me is the third token that I'm \nnice and bullish on. Then there's a token that's   a little bit earlier than the rest. Okay. And \nit doesn't have a crazy amount. I was looking   here this morning because it's only starting to \nget listed on different platforms and stuff now. Okay. And it's this token called Lighter. And what \nthis is is the DEX, right? Very similar to the   Hyperliquid all these different types. Okay. I know a lot of people that have had a lot of   success when it comes to Lighter and the platform \nand trading on the platform itself. And we also   realized throughout the last few months that \nDEXes were becoming one of the hot things,   right? Hot things within the market. Decentralized \ntrading. You don't need to know me. Okay? And I   want a place to trade my money, right? DEXes. I am \nAZ 6777. Amazing. I'm trading amount of money. You   don't know that it's Sheldon, this person, this \nperson, this person, right? So for me, DEXes is   one of the plays that are becoming big, okay? And \nhave becoming big and I do think is going to be   one of the big runners when the market starts to \nrally up again. Okay? And I looked at Hyperliquid. I think Hyperliquid has done incredible, but I \ndon't think it's the biggest opportunity within   the market. Okay? Spoke to a bunch of friends, \nbunch of guys that are trading it. And Lighter   definitely for me is one of the better market cap \ntokens, better opportunities right now. Okay. Now,   when you don't have too much details on \nthe charts, I'm looking for breakouts,   right? And what I saw recently over \nhere, specifically shorter time frame,   is we've started breaking out and there is another \nbreakout point that I don't think we should miss,   right? And it's this area of this $3 mark."

And what I saw recently over here, specifically shorter time frame, is we've started breaking out and there is another breakout point that I don't think we should miss, right? And it's this area of this $3 mark. So, what I've been doing is this is purely   a bot verse a bot and spot trade structure, and \nI'm accumulating this anywhere between the areas   of this 2.6 to the 2.88 areas over here. I do \nand many that I've spoken to as well do see an   opportunity of up to a $5 to $6 mark over \nhere. Do your own research on this token. Have your own views on this token. But the main \nreason why I'm bringing this to your attention   now is I'm seeing a lot of volume spikes. I'm \nseeing a lot of accumulation happening on this   specific token. Okay? And this narrative \nover here too. This specific token volume   spikes I'm seeing on many many many different \nplatforms. So have a look at that one. It is   a token that I am personally building a lot and \nit's one of the newer tokens within the market. The next one to show you guys right is \ngood old AVAX which for me was getting   going last year. I still think this is one \nof the best altcoins in the market. I think   they're they're related in the gaming space. I \nthink they're in the AI space. I think they're   in many many many different categories. That is \nthe future within this world. Okay. And I still   think that this specifically catching this at \n$13 is crazy. Okay. But again, I want a chart   understanding of why would I buy this thing? And \nagain, for me, breaking of key structure at the   bottom. What am I trying to do? I'm trying \nto catch the pump outside of the disbelief   and I'm looking for the hope stage rally over \nhere. I think this can be a $100 future token,   but I don't want to say that that's going here \nin three months. Yeah, we'll see right where this   goes. But ultimately the trade and the aspect of \nwhere it is right now, it's a good entry. Okay,   we have broken out. We have retested. Okay, and \nthere's one more thing that we are looking for. Again, this is spot entries. This is bot when I'm \nlooking to leverage this thing is when we break   through this trend over here which is saying in \nthe next couple of days that will be some leverage   entries. Nonetheless, good entries on AVAX. And \nwhere I'm seeing AVAX rally to is up to the 20,   okay, to the $23 mark. Okay, a very nice strong 70 \n80% trade. Again, the gains are cool, but it comes   down to where are we at risk-wise. And again, \nI put the bottom trend here to know where my   risk would be. Where do I protect positions \nand things like that? Let's look at it. So,   where I would look to protect positions is around \nthe 12.6 to 12.7. Okay, which is giving me around   a 8% risk and my reward is looking anyway up to \nthe 50% like I said anyway up to the 70% mark   2 risk-to-reward risk this big reward this big \ngood token good project good area of where we are   right now I'm super interested in this position \nso AVAX is the next one that I'm looking at. Then Render. Render a ridiculous amount of volume \nis starting to come into Render. This token has   taken forever, right? But AI space, gaming space, \nNvidia space, all of these best top narratives in   stock markets in the world right now, for me, \nRender is one of the biggest ones in the play,   right? And why I'm super interested now is it did \nstart to break trend a couple of days back. Okay? And this is specifically a higher time frame \nentry that we're looking at here."

Then Render. Render a ridiculous amount of volume is starting to come into Render. This token has taken forever, right? But AI space, gaming space, Nvidia space, all of these best top narratives in stock markets in the world right now, for me, Render is one of the biggest ones in the play, right? And why I'm super interested now is it did start to break trend a couple of days back. Okay? And this is specifically a higher time frame entry that we're looking at here. But if I look   at the very high break that we are seeing here, \nokay, we are breaking a very long amount of trend   going all the way to November 2024. And this for \nme is a token that's getting ready to move. Okay,   anywhere up to the areas of up to $5. And when \nI see $5, I see up to 120%. Again, these are   later. I think this is a $12 token in the future \ndefinitely, right? Is that in 3 months, 6 months,   10 years? We'll see. But right now, opportunity \nof where we're looking, the token that's breaking   out, a token that's looking nice and strong. This \nis very much a higher time frame play, non-lever   right now, unless again, how do you know where to \ntake leverage? We're actually breaking a 1-hour. So, this is where you would put a stop loss. Okay? And this could be a leverage position entry for   you right now as it speaks, right? You can put \na stop here. You can put a stop under 618. Okay? Okay, so leverage just comes down to looking for \na little bit of shorter time frame break. Okay,   looking at where you're going to put your stop \nloss. Your stop loss will determine how much   leverage to enter, right? So again, this is a \ntrade for me if I'm wanting to protect myself. It will be a little bit of a bigger stop loss. This would be around 1.9, 1.8, 1.7. The key is   not to get stopped out of this trade just in \ncase there's any massive melt up in the market. I don't want to go to zero, right? Which is super \nimportant. And for me again upside is up to the   $5 mark is where I'm looking. $4.5 to $5 is \nthe next push that I am looking at for Render. Then let's speak about Fetch. Fetch is another \none. AI space, right? This is a token for me   breaking out of the daily trends, retesting into \nsupport right now, and I'm seeing a push up to 60   cents, right? Breaking all the structures, getting \nready for a hope pump. Okay? And I look at this D.   Like okay cool my protection zones will be \naround 24 to the 23 cent mark to 60 cents   risk-to-reward really good right now good \nnarrative breaking strength volume coming in   for me is one of the the trades and tokens that \nI am focusing on right now so there is Fetch. Then I have a couple of the old dogs the ones that \nI love very much I think the risk is really good   right now I think they are good entries Chainlink \nI'm still a big believer in Chainlink okay took   that does rally when we have alt seasons, which we \nhave not had. We haven't had a real altcoin pump. But nonetheless, look at that trend break. Look \nwhere we are right now. Retesting right now. So,   for me, opportunity incoming on Chainlink. Okay, good entries. Where am I seeing us go   again? Mid-range push. So, this is not me saying, \n\"Ah, bull market crazy runs.\" I'm saying, \"Guys,   100% here. Do you want it?\" Right? Because \nagain, we came down 80% on a lot of alts. So it's like 100 to 150% just to go \nhalfway from where we dropped halfway,   right? If we obviously go to the top, it's three \n400% pumps. We will see that as it plays out,   right? Wouldn't that this market trap everyone if \nit did? Just go back to the highs, right? Crazy. Okay. Again, that's just me green green blood. But \nnonetheless, just normal basics of trading. I'm   seeing a push at any point from here to the areas \nof up to 17 all the way up to 20 $20 mark. Good   risk-to-reward, good entries as we speak right \nnow."

I'm seeing a push at any point from here to the areas of up to 17 all the way up to 20 $20 mark. Good risk-to-reward, good entries as we speak right now. There is Chainlink looking nice and strong. Then we have Algorand. Why am I so interested \nin this? Because we are breaking a 1 2 3 4 5 6   touch trend line broke out retest higher high \nfrom here. I'm looking at a push up to the 24   to the 25 cent mark. Right. Protection \nzones on this is around 12 cents. Again,   we put in the risk-to-reward ratio here. Boom. That's the opportunity that I am   seeing when it comes to Algorand. So, \nthis is a opportunity that I'm seeing. Then, let's speak about So, those are my 10, \nright? I think I did them all. Oh, Solana,   Solana, Solana, Solana, Solana. I \nsee a $170 to $190 pump incoming. We have started breaking out just to show \nyou guys again. Why are my trends down here? Because I want to be in the most recent \narea. If I find higher time frame breaks,   that's cool. So, let's go through here and see \nwhat is higher time frame breaks on SOL. Look   at that. Right? Once we break through there, \nstrong strength. I zoom in a little bit more. I see where's the most recent breaks. You could \nsee a big decisions coming. Right? And again for   me I'm seeing slightly more bullish views right \nnow than bearish accumulation zone and I'm seeing   a push up to the areas of 200 protection \nzones is around 123 to $125 mark on SOL. So those are my 10. We'll go through a couple of \nyour tokens soon. Okay. So the next one is Zcash. Who thinks it's over for Zcash, right? Probably \nmany. Probably many. Probably many. I remember I   remember speaking about this in the beginning of \nthe week and saying that there's two dumps coming. Remember I said there was a bounce. I don't think \nit's real. And then I saw a drop down to 360. This   is my views on Zcash and I am buying it in these \nareas between 350 and 370 as a spot trade. I don't   think it's worth leveraging right now. It's a bit \nvolatile, but this is a interesting chart to pay   attention to that we are coming into the hot green \nzone, the bottom. I'm seeing this as a bull flag   and I am actually seeing an exit of up to $700 \nin the future. Take a bit of time. Right now, I   don't care about gains. I care about entries with \nlow risk. Okay? But it needs to be obviously worth   the gains. So, if I look at this and I look at I \nwould protect myself around 330. Okay? You can see   that the risk-to-reward for me is at a good area. Little bit more downside. We're 380 now. Little   bit more down. I think it's a good token. I am \npersonally going to be entering that position. When it comes to what else is showing some \nstrength, obviously we have the old MATIC   or the new MATIC which is POL, Polygon. I don't \nknow if it's Polyark or Polygon or whatever it is,   right? I know it's been around for a long time. I've was always a MATIC lover. Okay. But there is   some strength. This thing's obviously majorly \noversold, but pay attention to where the hell   we at right now. There's the break volume \nincoming, right? Look at the volume spike,   higher volume that we've seen in a long time. Look at the trend line break on volume, right? And   that that for me means real breakout, right? Real \nbreakout, real move, halfway mid-range. This would   be a spot trade only for me, right? Which would be \nthe areas of around 50 cents. Obviously future a   lot higher but for the trade around 40 to 50 cents \nis where I see us at any point rallying up to. Okay, let's have a look. Someone said Virtuals. Let's see."

Let's see if this thing is   looking good. Okay. Yeah, short-term strength \nis good. Where it really starts to break out   is this weekly trend here. So something like \nthis. Probably seeing a push up here to 1.5. This probably in a couple of weeks a really big \nbreakout to get us back to the $4 mark. Right now   I'm seeing a push around 1.5. Not bad. Not bad. Um pretty decent over here when it comes to that   over here. Uh just to show you guys that obviously \nme I'm trading the BitFunded but I've also started   releasing a couple of my trades leverage trades. So as you can see I am in see if I can show you   guys on the camera here. I've started building a \nSUI position. It won't set up here. Okay. But I'm   starting to enter my leverage positions as well \noutside of the BitFunded views over here. Remember   guys, link below if you want to BitFunded. I'm \ndoing a event. We are clarifying on Monday the   dates of when we are doing this event, but I'm \ngoing to be doing a 7-day pass a challenge with   BitFunded. You buy a challenge right now. You \nget the same value challenge two-step method for   free with the challenge you get right now. This \nwill close though when the challenge has begun. This is where it's the only way you can get \nthat special of getting two for one. Okay,   there's the BitFunded over here. And obviously \nyou guys know there are a bunch of different   packages just to show you guys the packages. So you buy a one step. So you can say limit   limited time only. Any of these you'll get the \nsame value for free. Right with it a two-step   you will get it for free. And again this \nis will also get you into the challenge. Uh   and I spoke about Bybit as well. Bybit good \nsign up bonuses right now if you sign up to   Bybit account today. Obviously the best trading \nplatform in the world. Um love them very much. Okay Maddie let's get through a couple of people's \nrequests. What are we seeing guys? What are we   seeing? What are we wanting to see? What tokens \nwould you like me to chart for you? Let me know. Let's see. NEAR Protocol. Okay. Bring some more. Bring some more. Then I can load them all up here. Okay, we got NEAR Protocol Sonic. Really \ndisappointing for me. I was a midterm holder. I'm now a long-term holder of Sonic. Sonic is just \ndropping and dropping and dropping and dropping   and dropping. Not buying as much as what I used \nto. I'm buying a little bit where I can to reduce   my entry price. It's telling us in the next few \nweeks we should see a breakout, but realistically   it's going to get back to around 30 cents, 40 \ncents. I'm not thinking much higher than that. So   I was buying a lot at 50. I bought at 60. I bought \nat 30. I bought at 20. Right now it's at 8. So the   only reason I'd buy more is to obviously dollar \ncost a little bit more into my entry. But if I can   buy a bit here and double to triple my money here, \nit can help me recover and and it's a good trade,   right? But it's not ready yet. When this weekly \ntrend breaks, that is for me when it will be   ready. Same thing with NEAR. NEAR is still quite \nfar from a high time frame breaks. I do think   there's a short-term trade incoming. It has broken \nout of the short-term trends. So, I do think there   is a push at any point to the areas around 2.3, \n2.4, 2.5. And that is where I'd basically TP on   some trades."

It has broken out of the short-term trends. So, I do think there is a push at any point to the areas around 2.3, 2.4, 2.5. And that is where I'd basically TP on some trades. Long-term, I do think it's a $10 \ntoken. But obviously, we don't want to put time   predictions on that over there. ENA breaking out. Let's have a look. Obviously, ENA is also one of   the newer tokens of the cycles DEXes, right? I \nthink this is the the Binance DEX. Okay. Yes, ENA   is breaking out on the 15-minute chart for those \nthat were saying over there. Pay attention for   a 4-hour break. We're not too far from a 4-hour \nbreak. From here, a push up anywhere up to short   time frame, it's a 10% move. High time frame when \nthis thing's ready to get going. We are looking   at a push to around the dollar mark. So, not \nbad. Not bad. Not one of my favorites, but I do   think it is a good token to have in your long-term \nportfolio. I do. I do think it's a very good one. Uh let's go some more. Let's go. Let's \ngo. Let's go. Guys, remember Sniper Club   free trading community for you right now. You \nwant to be a part of the BitFunded challenge,   it's going to be in club, right?
