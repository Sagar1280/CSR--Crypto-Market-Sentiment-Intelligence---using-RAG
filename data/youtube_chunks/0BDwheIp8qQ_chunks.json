Always do your own research. Hey guys, what is up? Welcome back to the channel. I hope you had an excellent Christmas. I hope you have been enjoying some time off with your friends and your family. Today we are looking at Bitcoin and we are looking at whether or not Bitcoin price today is relatively fair value or not. And so what we are looking at here is a regression channel, okay? A logarithmic regression channel. And what this tells you is based upon historical data, what price today is Bitcoin relative to its history? Is it undervalued relative to history? Is it overvalued relative to history? And this guy who built this, it is a pretty cool thing. You can see what he said here. Bitcoin has been moving between the green and the blue zones for over 2 years. These two zones here. It has never done that before. And so far, this bull market has been the most stable bull market ever. We have known this bull market has been a little bit different to previous bull markets. I know \"this time is different\" is obviously blasphemy. However, this time actually has been different. I am going to go into some exact reasons as to why that is, but you can see it in the charts really. This time has been like a step function. Previous bull markets have been aggressive sort of like euphoria blow-off top phases. So, we have just had steady accumulation, no fear, just steady growth. Right? This chart is that same thing there, the logarithmic regression channel of Bitcoin. And what you can see is that we have been trading in this green and blue zone all cycle apart from the FTX lows. This is not that normal. Normally we see Bitcoin push towards the upper sides or the upper bands of this logarithmic channel. And what this tells you is look, this is the sort of like first real cycle in 2013. It hit the top side of this regression channel. The second cycle hit the top side too. Actually poked past it a little bit. But 2021 we did not hit that top side. And this cycle, we have barely even touched above this blue line here. And what this blue line is, the top of the blue line is 85% of the time, Bitcoin is less than this value in terms of its relative price. When Bitcoin is in the blue and the green zones, for the most part, it is pretty much fair value, especially this sort of like the band between the green and the blue. The lower end of the green band, Bitcoin is relatively cheap. The upper end of the blue band, well, Bitcoin is relatively expensive. If you like average out Bitcoin history, actually it spends a lot of"

The lower end of the green band, Bitcoin is relatively cheap. The upper end of the blue band, well, Bitcoin is relatively expensive. If you like average out Bitcoin history, actually it spends a lot of time in this kind of like green band, especially during bear markets. This cycle has not been a bear market. Obviously, Bitcoin has gone from $16,000 all the way to $126,000. I mean, it has had a massive, massive run, a massive accumulation in price. Yes, the last year has not really gone anywhere. Actually, fact, Bitcoin has gone down within the last year. But relative to this chart, Bitcoin right now is fair value. It is well within the sort of range you would expect to find it most of the time. Now, this does not mean Bitcoin cannot go down from here. My base case actually is that probably we do see more downside pressure, but this is to say that look, there is nothing that is going to force Bitcoin into these upper echelon bands. And actual fact, as more time goes on, Bitcoin is less and less likely to hit the upper echelons of these returns because as it gets larger, as the asset grows in price, obviously it is going to take more and more money to move it. As the asset gets more adoption, it is just going to see a reduced amount of volatility like we have seen all year. If we look at the volatility this cycle, it is massively reduced relative to last cycle as well. So, I just want to be cautious when people are comparing Bitcoin to the S&P, Bitcoin to gold for example, all these comparisons of Bitcoin against other things and then saying, \"Look, Bitcoin needs to catch up.\" Look, Bitcoin actually relative to its history, its own history, is relatively fair value right now. And if we look at Bitcoin relative to global liquidity, we have seen lots of charts looking at global liquidity in the past. This one is pretty cool. All it shows you is look, Bitcoin normally trends with global liquidity. It goes a little bit ahead of global liquidity sometimes. Sometimes it lags global liquidity, but on the whole it moves with global liquidity. You can see this chart down here with the clouds around Bitcoin price. Global liquidity gradually goes up. Bitcoin gradually goes up with it. Sometimes it is above this sort of like green line here. Sometimes it is below. Generally, you know, it is above, right? And especially this cycle, generally it has been above. What this chart"

Bitcoin gradually goes up with it. Sometimes it is above this sort of like green line here. Sometimes it is below. Generally, you know, it is above, right? And especially this cycle, generally it has been above. What this chart is saying is look, there are times when Bitcoin is leading global liquidity. There are times when it is lagging global liquidity, but generally it trends pretty much in line with it. It is a macro asset. When there is more liquidity, Bitcoin tends to trend with the trend. However, we have seen this disconnect here. Look at this white line, which is the Bitcoin price has disconnected here, and we are now trading in the lower ends of these regression bands. And what does it tell you? Well, basically, if you look at this top chart up here, it shows a little bit clearer. This is the global liquidity index, but just as an oscillator. And all it tells you is, look, when Bitcoin is leading global liquidity, this white line is above zero. When it is lagging, this white line is beneath zero. And actually right now we are right on this lower end. So we are two standard deviations away from the mean. And what this tells you is look, Bitcoin is rarely in this position. It has been in this position six times since 2015 or six times in history pretty much. It is rarely this decoupled from global liquidity. So there is absolutely a situation right now where Bitcoin is lagging recently. The S&P lagging gold, lagging silver, etc. People have been saying it was the October 10th that was the thing that disconnected the market. But this disconnect of global liquidity actually happened before October 10th. It was not just an October 10th thing. Global liquidity was expanding and Bitcoin was not really following it. Then it started to come down whilst global liquidity continued to expand. These are very, very long-term charts though. This is a 12-year chart. It is definitely not something that is going to happen and correct tomorrow. But as a result of this disconnect, what we are seeing is that people are saying this all-time high was not like the others. Therefore, Bitcoin must catch up. It must go up. The bull market is not over. This chart just shows you cycle high performance. So each of these lines is a cycle of Bitcoin. This is 2013. The red one is 2017. The blue one is 2021. And the black one is this cycle. And you can see this cycle actually Bitcoin has done relatively poor especially versus other"

The red one is 2017. The blue one is 2021. And the black one is this cycle. And you can see this cycle actually Bitcoin has done relatively poor especially versus other cycles. This is like what 40x here, 20x here, you know, 6x here. And this is from all-time high to the next all-time high. Obviously the bigger Bitcoin gets, the lower those highs are going to be because we have just got diminishing returns. That has to happen. Otherwise, Bitcoin will be, you know, a quadrillion dollar asset. This is the sort of thing we are seeing a lot of like Bitcoin must catch up because it is undervalued because it has not done what it did last cycle because it is lagging against other indices, other global assets. This is where I think arguably in the short term, especially not really necessarily very true. These are massively long-term trends. And if we zoom out, right, Bitcoin is being compared to gold. This I showed you a logarithmic regression channel earlier. This one actually takes gold rather than dollars as the denominator. Right? So the thing that Bitcoin is being priced in is gold ounces as opposed to dollars. And you can see we saw it when we were comparing it to dollars. Bitcoin was relatively fair value. It was in this green zone. But against gold, Bitcoin is aggressively undervalued here supposedly because we are in this gray zone. And actually this guy is not saying that we should use this model to perfectly decide what the good value of Bitcoin is. But I have seen this model spread around in a few other places saying look Bitcoin is massively undervalued against gold. Therefore it must catch up. Just quickly guys I want to tell you about Easy Bitcoin. This segment is sponsored by Easy Bitcoin. They are part of the Easy Group family and Easy Bitcoin operate a recurring purchase service for Bitcoin. The service functions through scheduled card payments at user-defined intervals. Upon processing payment, the company purchased Bitcoin and transfers it to a user's specified address. The service operates in non-custodial basis, meaning purchase Bitcoin is sent directly to the user's controlled wallet without being held on the platform. This means users can choose how much they want to DCA, how frequently they want to DCA, and it is never held by Easy Bitcoin. It is always held in the user's own wallet.

One thing that is important to sort of like grasp here is gold was basically flat for the 12-year period whilst Bitcoin was ripping. Let me just show you this. What you can see is that when Bitcoin is compared against gold, yes, obviously Bitcoin right now against gold in all of Bitcoin history, it looks incredibly good value. We just saw that regression chart, but this is because those charts when you compare all history, what are they looking at? Gold had a completely ridiculously terrible 10 or 12 year period. Just look at this. Gold did not break above this level for I mean, I think it is 12 years. Look at this. We measure from here all the way to when gold actually begins to break above and it is 4,500 days. Yeah, it is like 12 years. Absolutely crazy. So, when we are looking at Bitcoin against gold, you have to remember that gold was basically flat for an entire period. So, of course, because gold has gone up aggressively since the middle of 2023. Yes, it has gone up too quite a lot since that period, but especially within the last year, gold has done 70%. Bitcoin has done, you know, minus 10%. It looks like a massive disconnect, but really this elastic band was pulled aggressively into negative territory for gold already. Now, personally, I think Bitcoin is going to catch up, but I really, really, really, really do not think it is going to be something that happens immediately, especially in the short term. The idea that this is now done, I just think is like, well, why is it done now? There has got to be a good reason for it to just just be done now. And so, from here, if we come back to just the Bitcoin chart, I think there is a very, very good reason to believe this all-time high from 2021, which has never been tested. It is very likely to be tested. Blue line is the 50-week moving average, and the sort of golden line is the 200-week moving average. Every time Bitcoin closes underneath the 50-week, it generally signals the end of a"

It is very likely to be tested. Blue line is the 50-week moving average, and the sort of golden line is the 200-week moving average. Every time Bitcoin closes underneath the 50-week, it generally signals the end of a bull market. Now, this probably is not necessarily news to you, but look, Bitcoin closes underneath the 50-week here, goes much, much lower afterwards. Bitcoin closes underneath the 50-week here, again, goes much lower afterwards. Bitcoin again closes underneath the 50-week here. This is the end of the 2013 bull market. Closed underneath there and again, it comes much much lower. What you tend to find is that Bitcoin finds support around the 200-week moving average. Find support on the 200-week after closing below. Find support on the 200-week after coming below again. It retests the under. This is 2021. What happened? It came, closed underneath, retested, came all the way back down. It actually lost the 200-week in 2021, which is quite unlikely. Obviously, this was the FTX situation, the Luna situation, just sent Bitcoin to all hell. And right now, the 200-week moving average is all the way down at 56K. So, it is not even that low. And if you think like high to low, that is only 55% down from the all-time high. It is really quite reasonable when you think about it. And actually, if we put a line of best fit on here, this trend line here basically sort of like mimics the way the moving average was going. This is my base case. Actually, we at least test the old all-time high at sort of like, you know, 69Kish, 65 to 69K. I think this region basically has to be tested just from a technical perspective. It has never been tested so far. This moving average will probably hit this kind of area around March of next year. You know, call it between sort of like end of Q1, start of Q2. In that sort of region, there is going to be a new Fed chair by then. Our market is going to front-run that. But to be honest, my base case of what I think happens is we are right here right now. We retest the underside of this 50-week at least. Maybe we break a little bit above it. But as long as there are no closures, there are no weekly closures and open and close above this level, then I think we just come down. We test this area. I think that is enough for a new cycle to begin for Bitcoin overall. Whether you want to call it cycles,"

I think that is enough for a new cycle to begin for Bitcoin overall. Whether you want to call it cycles, whether you want it to be liquidity, Bitcoin is in a downtrend. It has been in a downtrend. Unless it can get above this old wick high here like 107K, it is going to remain pressured to the downside. I think looking at all these charts comparing Bitcoin to silver, Bitcoin to gold, Bitcoin to the S&P, whilst they all provide a compelling reason for Bitcoin to be catching up, I just do not see the catch-up trade happening immediately. And look, Bitcoin is massively decoupled in terms of its performance against basically every other asset, right? This is Bitcoin against silver. I mean, it has been aggressively beaten by silver. Bitcoin against the NASDAQ. It has been absolutely destroyed against the NASDAQ since the start of July. Bitcoin is down 37% against the NASDAQ. Obviously, the NASDAQ has been ripping against gold. Since the end of last year, Bitcoin is down 52% against gold and against silver. Just this year, Bitcoin is down 65% against gold just this year. And since the end of last year, Bitcoin is down 67% against silver. Data across crypto is not looking great. This is 7-day exchange volume. Look at this for a perfect chart of lower highs and lower lows. High, lower high, lower high, lower high, lower high, lower high. Looked like it was going to reverse here, but no. Lower high, lower high, lower high. This is a chart of total daily exchange volume. That is telling you how many people are trading these things in crypto. Nowhere near as many as in 2021. Not even close to as many as 2021. Despite the fact we have had stablecoin adoption, despite the fact we have got RWAs on-chain, despite the fact we have got regulatory backdrop improving, Clarity Act coming soon, blah blah blah. It has not pushed more people to come and use crypto. Has not pushed more people on-chain. Crypto is actively missing a large number of its users. The question is quite simple. Is the world becoming more or less financialized? Are people getting more or less trust in their governments? Are more and more things being put onto blockchain rails?

I mean, it is very clear the answer to these questions is yes. There is more adoption coming. More things are going to be put on financial rails. More people have an interest in finance. It is clear that in 5 years, at least to me, crypto is going to be a core piece of infrastructure that underpins basically all of finance. I do not doubt that. But in the shorter term, I am very much convinced prices are coming lower, and I am quite happy about that, to be honest. Finally, guys, just a massive shout out to the channel sponsor, Uphold. Uphold is a wicked exchange with deep liquidity. They actually made the Forbes best list in 2024. And the main reason I like them is because you can get this card, and if you are in crypto, you will know how painful it can be turning assets on-chain into money in your bank. Being able to spend it directly has been incredibly convenient for me. This is not intended for UK audience. Crypto is a high-risk investment. You could lose all your money and you should not expect protection if something goes wrong. Thank you very much to Uphold for sponsoring this portion of the video. I am happy if Bitcoin just does 20% annually per year and I am able to accumulate it in the 80K region, 70K region, 60K region, whatever. Even if it goes down as far as 40K, 50K, to me it would actually be a good thing. I know it would cause a lot of pain along the way, but anyway, thank you ever so much for watching, guys. I hope you had an excellent Christmas. Hope you have a great time with your family. I shall see you in the next one."
