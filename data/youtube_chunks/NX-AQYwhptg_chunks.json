      "text": "I think what people should think about is we don't have an IPO for Bitcoin, but this last four months to me feels like sourcing the pricing of the IPO where the where the original investors are getting out of large chunks. Now, why is there ever an IPO? This is 100% true. Breaking news. Satoshi Ara just sold all of his Bitcoin after 14 years of holding. He just dumped 10,000 Bitcoin worth over 1 billion. Is this the start of a bare market? You can see here that shortly after the October 10th incident, he began selling off all of his Bitcoin, going from 100% 10,000 Bitcoin, 1 billion to now today, zero. And taking a look at the chart, it looks terrible. Guys, smash the like button. Make sure you watch today's entire video. I have a lot of information you need to see. I would love to get this info on your radar and kind of clue you in to what's coming down the road. Bitcoin isn't over. You're being fooled by information like this. And it is truly surprising how people are running with headlines like this saying Bitcoin is dead. Crypto is over. Is that what you think? Do you think Bitcoin is dead? Do you think crypto is over? This is Bitcoin's real chart. I want to revisit this chart in just a couple of minutes. There's something interesting going on here. Yeah, it does look terrible, but we'll discuss it in just a few minutes. And if you notice what's interesting about this chart, comment below. I think it's important you understand what's actually going on behind the scenes. So, I want to play you about a minute of this clip. Again, maybe you've already seen this, but I think the information shared here from a 22-year Wall Street veteran is invaluable. A lot of people think that Bitcoin is broken, but it's not broken. It's maturing. And what's going on behind the scenes is actually long-term bullish. Jordy Visser says, \"Bitcoin is going through a silent IPO moment, and this twominute clip explains exactly what is going on. Like, I sent this clip to my friends and family because I want people to understand what's actually going on with Bitcoin and crypto. >> What's your read on Bitcoin and are are you giving up? Are you walking away?\" >> No. The So, a couple things. Number one, every possible thing to everyone listening that you would want for Bitcoin is happening right now. Meaning the government is supporting things. The financial guard rails are shifting. We've got news after news every single day about the financial guardrails becoming more digital economy. It's things that are necessary for the network effects to kick in. All of that has happened. We still see inflows from retail. We still see the banks now opening it up for people to go through, but there's clearly a bunch of whatever it is, OGs, Bitcoin miners out of China, whoever it is, large amounts. If you go back to July, there have been billions and billions of dollars of, let's say, original investors supporting Bitcoin, regardless of how you want to term it. I think what people should think about is we don't have an IPO for Bitcoin, but this last four months to me feels like sourcing the pricing of the IPO where the where the original investors are getting out of large chunks now. Why is there ever an IPO for monetization? If someone has 9 billion in Bitcoin, I mean, I think they should diversify a little bit. Um, if it was related to China, guess what China has now that they haven't had since 2014 15? A bull market in stocks. Guess what else people have? Well, they have the chance to invest in AI. AI is a 10bagger in many cases. You've been able to do it in the public markets. So, I think at some point Bitcoin becomes a boring asset to people who are looking for three baggers, four baggers, five baggers. It becomes a diversification. So, I think this is just a distribution of a few massive holders. And the weaknesses I have heard about Bitcoin as I've gotten into it from institutions. It's too volatile. Not too volatile anymore. We've taken the implied volatility and the actual realized volatility down to 30 and below in some cases. So, the VSS come down. Okay. What's the next thing? Well, it's too concentrated in ownership. I mean, I've gone through the numbers. When you add Satoshi's wallet, you add the other whales, you're talking about about a third of it has been owned by not many people. I think like 10,000 is the number I heard."

I think like 10,000 is the number I heard. Regardless of what the right answer is, every every month the Bitcoin IBIT outstanding shares goes up. It's up again this month even though the price is down. So, I think everyone that's depressed has actually become entitled. I think they they think it's a risk asset. Oh, there's another one. This is just a risk asset. Okay. Well, it's not going up with the NASDAQ, so that's good. Lower correlation. Well, it's just digital gold. Well, it's not going up with gold. So, guess what? In portfolio theory, for everyone who hasn't bought any yet, I think with your stocks, with your gold, with your bonds, now there's every argument to make. It's lower volatility now, lower correlation with the other traditional asset class, diversification from gold. I think this thing is going to move higher. I was wrong about where I thought we'd be at this point. It's still up for the year. I think once this consolidation is done and we're through the IPO process and the fundamentals take over next year once we get through clarity and the beginning of tokenization and the stories of zel and everything along those lines I think we're going to have an acceleration. So think about it like this when accumulation is happening without excitement it usually means something is building markets rarely top when confidence is missing. Price is holding, sentiment is neutral, participation is selective. That often signals digestion rather than distribution. These phases feel uncomfortable because momentum shows up. How are you playing this phase? And the fact is we are seeing bottoming signals. Bitcoin is moving from net realized losses back into net realized profit. This transition has marked recoveries from local bottoms over the past two years. And it almost goes without saying to our audience at Altcoin Daily, you understand this. Bitcoin's not going away. I I can't believe still people think Bitcoin's going away. Bitcoin has become a $2 trillion asset. Never in financial history has anything reached 2 trillion and disappeared. Tom Lee, Bitcoin has now been around for 15 years and there has not been a Bitcoin 2.0. >> Mhm. >> So there's no crypto 2.0. This is Bitcoin is the is the surviving chain >> and Bitcoin has become a $2 trillion asset which never in history financial history has anything reached $2 trillion and then disappeared. >> Mhm. >> So we're not it's a different argument if it was hundred billion. >> Okay. >> Um the third is the US government is reiterated its commitment to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. >> That's not bad for the price of Bitcoin. So if someone has is watching this and said well they don't understand Bitcoin so they decide not to own it. >> It's a catast it's a catastrophic way to look at market. So let's talk about Ethereum. I actually think Ethereum is gearing up to have a much stronger narrative in the next one or two years. I think Ethereum is really a dark horse in this space especially with the building going on with the Ethereum Foundation and the devs and the Wall Street adoption we're seeing. Ethereum just hit the highest daily network growth in its history. About 320,000 new ETH wallets created per day over the past week. 300 almost 400,000 new wallets on Sunday alone, the highest single day ever. What makes this even more interesting is the context. While wallet creation accelerated, fees dropped meaningfully after recent upgrades. Stable coin transfers reached 8 trillion in Q4 and new users are showing up for real usage, not speculation. How could you not be bullish on Ethereum? With the Genius Act being passed, with the Clarity Act hopefully being passed in Q1 or Q2 of this year, eventually for sure it will be passed by Ethereum before Apple announces it."

With the Genius Act being passed, with the Clarity Act hopefully being passed in Q1 or Q2 of this year, eventually for sure it will be passed by Ethereum before Apple announces it. And not just Apple, big MAG7 companies like Apple. Save this video because I want you to come back to this video when this actually happens. So Tom Lee's wildly bullish predictions. Little bit of a meme at this point of course, but you have to understand Tom Lee has continued to buy during this downtime. He's putting his money where his mouth is. And what I like about this clip, he's on stage and not only gives his Ethereum price prediction and how he thinks about the future of Ethereum's price, but he talks about the fundamental things that are happening behind the scenes that will lead Ethereum to much higher levels in the future. So, I think it is worth it paying attention to the reasoning in this clip. Listen here. Let me explain to you why Ethereum, now that we've talked about crypto, Ethereum is the future of finance. And what I mean by that is Ethereum in this year [snorts] it's having its 1971 moment. But what I'm saying is that in 1971 the dollar went off the gold standard. And in 1971 it galvanized Wall Street to create financial products to make sure the dollar would be the reserve currency. Well, in 2025, we're tokenizing everything. So, it's not just the dollar that's getting tokenized, but it's stocks, bonds, real estate, and Wall Street is is again going to take advantage of that and create products onto a smart contract platform. And where they're building this is on Ethereum. And today, if you look at the share of real world assets, and the prior panel talked about that, the majority of this, the vast majority is being built on Ethereum. Even he has said e Ethereum has won the smart contract war. As you know, Ethereum has been rangebound for five years as I've shaded here, but it's begun to break out. And that's the one of the reasons why myself and Mosaics, Shen from Mosaics is here. We uh got very involved with Ethereum by turning Bitmine into an Ethereum treasury company because we saw this breakout coming. Now, this might actually be more important because Bitcoin and Ethereum are really the two most important crypto plat L1s or blockchains out there. But if 2025 is about tokenization, that means Ethereum's utility value should be rising. Therefore, you should watch this ratio. Well, I think Bitcoin is going to get to 250,000. And if Ethereum price ratio to Bitcoin gets back to its 8-year average, that's $12,000 for Ethereum. But I think Ethereum is going to become the future of finance, the payment rails of the future. And if it gets to 0.25 relative to Bitcoin, that's 62,000. So, um, I think Ethereum at 3,000, of course, is grossly undervalued. So, let's revisit this chart. Bitcoin, it looks terrible. You can see after one slight kind of fake out up, Bitcoin just looks like it's going to crater down. But what's interesting about this chart is it is inverted. Let's flip it around. Bitcoin after one more small move down, a fake out, looks like it will melt up. Speaking about a meltup, look at what happened when the gold ETF launched back in 2004. Went up a little bit, consolidated for a while, dropped a little bit. Even before the ETF launch, look, a big runup going into it, then a cool down, consolidation period, and then that huge melt up. This could happen to Bitcoin. Bitcoin got institutionalized last year, just like gold got institutionalized in 2004. A big difference of course is that after the gold ETF launched there was more demand. They started mining more gold. They increased supply. With Bitcoin they cannot do that. In fact supply flow gets cut in half in just a few months."

In fact supply flow gets cut in half in just a few months. Back then it's going to get cut in half again in a couple years. Like and retweet if you agree. Follow for more. By the way, when I posted this chart, Bitcoin was around 40k, 50K, 60K. So exactly what happened to gold. big meltup as it got institutionalized by Wall Street as Wall Street started selling gold as buy gold commercials were finally allowed on TV. You remember these from back then? The same thing is happening with Bitcoin today. And we are here when it comes to Bitcoin today. Much higher than years ago. But still, people just don't know what's coming. Still don't believe me will understand this breaking. The Fed will inject 55.3 billion into markets over the next 3 weeks starting Tuesday. It's not QE. That's not rate cuts. That's direct liquidity. 55.3 billion flooding into risk assets in 21 days. And you're still wondering if it's too late to buy crypto position. Now, just like I've been saying, in the short term, we could see a little bit of a fake out, another Bitcoin price falls. In the short term, if Bitcoin's price falls off a cliff, there will be three reasons for this. Number one, Clarity Act issues. Number two, Jerome Powell. Number three, the the next looming government shutdown that hopefully they settle and we don't go into an even longer period like we did at the end of last year. These three potential problems would be catastrophic in Q1 of 2026, but we will be able to rally through. After all, the overall trend is your friend. This thing's going in one direction. So, I'm here to tell you it's not over. Bitcoin's not dead. It is just beginning. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Salana, Chain Link, there are a lot of quality assets and once we get back in to this riskoff environment, this business cycle, crypto's really going to rally.
