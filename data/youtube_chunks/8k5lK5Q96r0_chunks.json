      "text": "Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency \non the planet. That's because its robust smart   contracts and track record have made it the \ntop chain for things like DeFi, stable coins,   and tokenized RWAs. But what happens to these \nassets and services if ETH were to go to zero? Well, a recent report analyzes exactly that, and \nit's safe to say that the answer is terrifying. That's why today we'll break down this report \nfor you in simple terms. and revealed just how   worried you should be about this possibility. My \nname is Guy and you're watching the Coin Bureau. Before we begin though, I'm not a financial \nadviser and nothing in this video is financial   or investment advice. It's educational content \nintended to inform you about a recent Ethereum   focused report. So, if that sounds good, \npunch that like button. Let's get into it. So,   the report we'll be summarizing today is titled \nquote, \"What if Ether goes to zero? how market   risk becomes infrastructure risk in crypto. It \nwas recently published by the Italian Central Bank   and we'll be giving you the key highlights right \nhere in this video. We'll also leave a link to the   full report down in the description if you're \ninterested. Now, the report starts by looking   at the economic incentives behind permissionless \nblockchains, that is crypto blockchains. They're   called permissionless because anyone can become \na validator helping to secure the network and   earn rewards. nothing you don't already know. One \nof the biggest crypto blockchains is, of course,   Ethereum, which launched in 2015. Now, Ethereum's \nlaunch marked a major turning point for crypto   after Bitcoin's 2009 debut. Just like with \nBitcoin, users can use Ethereum to send the   chain's native currency, in this case, ETH. But \nEthereum's smart contracts let you do much more. These smart contracts make it possible \nto create decentralized applications,   which is why Ethereum is often referred to as a \nworld computer. These decentralized applications   make it possible to provide financial services \nwithout any intermediaries, which is truly   revolutionary. In any case, the report goes over a \nfew key Ethereum statistics. The report's authors   note that there are over 1.7 million tokens on \nEthereum alone. In turn, the Ethereum blockchain   that hosts these tokens is powered by over 10,000 \nnodes in more than 30 countries. In this context,   a node is a computer that hosts a copy of the \nblockchain. In other words, nodes simply store the   history of all the transactions on the blockchain. Now, the actual processing of transactions is done   by validators, and there are close to 1 million \nvalidators on Ethereum. Now, the report notes   that there are three ways validators can earn \nETH. First, newly minted ETH from block rewards. Second, ETH from gas, aka transaction fees. And third, by ordering transactions on Ethereum   strategically in order to maximize their rewards, \na process called maximum extractable value or MEV. Together, these incentivize validators to join \nthe Ethereum blockchain. As some of you will know,   Ethereum validators need between 32 and48 ETH to \noperate. This ETH is staked and validators monitor   each other for suspicious activity. If a bad actor \nis caught, their stake is slashed and burned,   resulting in a financial penalty. So, this \nsystem deters misconduct, though malicious   validators could still cause damage if enough \nof them were to collude. That said though,   a bad actor would need over 50% of the validator \nnetwork, known as a 51% attack, which thankfully   is practically impossible. The report notes that \nthis would require at least 17 million ETH costing   over 56 billion at today's prices. In short, it \nain't going to happen. The report references Lido   Finance, though, as a case study of validator \nconcentration since its validators account for   a quarter of all staked ETH. The report then \nprovides a chart of Lido's profitability from   January 2023 to July 2025. During that period, \nLido's APR fell from a 9% peak to just 3% as   network congestion eased and competition among \nvalidators increased. Logically, staking long-term   for a 3% yield isn't very exciting, especially \nsince that 3% isn't guaranteed. That said though,   ETH's price has risen steadily since January 2023. So, anyone who bought and staked ETH during that   time is sitting on some impressive gains. And this \nties nicely into the second part of the report,   which examines how ETH's price affects validator \nactivity. Since Ethereum's launch in 2015,   there have been countless catalysts that have \npushed ETH's price up or down. That's why it's   important to keep up with the headlines for \nanything that can impact the crypto market. This can be a lot of work, but it doesn't have to \nbe.

So, what are you waiting for? Sign up now using   the link below or by scanning this QR code. And \nnow back to the report which notes that in 2015,   ETH was trading between 50 and $2. And if \nyou're wishing you had a time machine right now,   you're not alone. Anyhow, ETH hit an all-time high \nin November 2021, though it slightly surpassed   that in August 2025, peaking just under $5,000 \nin both cases. Even after the 2021 high, though,   ETH fell below $1,000 during the bare market. Despite this volatility though, the number of   Ethereum validators has steadily risen, which \nthe report attributes to two main reasons which   go hand in hand. First, it notes that so-called \nunbacked cryptos like Ethereum are quote driven   mostly by investor confidence since there are \nno traditional fundamentals to anchor the price. Second, whenever the validator pool shrinks, \nstaking rewards rise. Higher rewards attract new   validators, keeping validator growth relatively \nstable. so long as ETH's price increases over   time. But here is where things get interesting. The report notes that even a drop in ETH's price   likely won't result in a massive validator exodus. That's simply because even during bearish market   conditions, validators and investors still have \nconfidence that ETH will recover eventually. But   what if this confidence was no longer there? Well, \nhere the report poses a few possible triggers   that could cause a loss of confidence in Ethereum. These include internal problems such as Ethereum's   governance resulting in slow progress or even \nregression. Another possibility, meanwhile, is   if there's a massive loss in confidence in Bitcoin \nor the broader crypto industry. Alternatively,   a rival blockchain could emerge that clearly \noutperforms Ethereum across every possible   metric, including scalability, speed, cost, and \nreliability. Outside of crypto, another reason   why investors and validators could lose faith \nin Ethereum, is if there are major macro shocks   like escalating global conflicts or if another \ntechnology is developed that turns out to be even   more effective than blockchain. The worst part is \nthat any of these factors could trigger a chain   reaction, pun intended, further eroding confidence \nin Ethereum. For example, a major macro shock like   a war could make BTC fall short of expectations, \nshaking trust in crypto as a whole. Meanwhile,   other sectors like AI might outperform crypto, \nprompting investors to shift capital there for   higher returns. In all these scenarios, the \nbelief that ETH's price will keep rising over   the long run would be shaken. And some would argue \nwe're not far off from that. Now, if things get   really bad, the only ones still standing would be \nlong-term believers in crypto's potential. At the   same time, those in it for the gains rather than \nthe tech will likely move elsewhere, including   a huge number of Ethereum validators. And this \nbrings us to the next part of the report, which   asks the pressing question, what happens on the \nway down? Well, if ETH's price starts plummeting,   but there's no confidence it will recover, the \nmost obvious outcome is that validators would   race to unstake their ETH in order to sell it, \nnot only would this crash ETH's price even more,   but it would also result in far fewer validators \nin the short term. In the report's words, quote,   \"No validators means that the network does not \nwork anymore. Users could keep on submitting   transactions, but those would never be settled. Assets would still live on chain, but they would   be immovable. Now, to clarify, the report points \nout that this process would be gradual thanks to   unstaking periods, but Ethereum security could \nbe hit immediately nonetheless. That's because   cheaper ETH makes it easier to gain enough power \nto run malicious validators."

In the report's words, quote, \"No validators means that the network does not work anymore. Users could keep on submitting transactions, but those would never be settled.

Now, to clarify, the report points out that this process would be gradual thanks to unstaking periods, but Ethereum security could be hit immediately nonetheless. That's because cheaper ETH makes it easier to gain enough power to run malicious validators. And with more honest   validators going offline, attacking the network \nbecomes far easier. Notably though, ETH wouldn't   be the primary target in this scenario because \nit would quickly become worthless. Instead,   attackers would focus on other major assets \nlikely less affected by Ethereum's collapse,   like stable coins and tokenized real world \nassets or RWAs, especially if issuers are legally   required to redeem them at face value. Anyway, the \nreport notes that if something like this happened,   Ethereum's future would hinge on investor \nconfidence in the aftermath. There's no way   to know exactly how it would play out. But \nthe crypto industry has repeatedly shown an   incredible ability to pick itself up, dust itself \ndown, and carry on moving forward. Then again,   the crypto industry has never seen the failure \nof truly core infrastructure before. Sure,   we've had major collapses like Mount Gaus, FTX, \nand the Teral Luna debacle, but since so much of   the industry runs on Ethereum, a breakdown there \nwould make those failures look like merely a bad   day at Disneyland. The report reiterates though \nthat there are mitigation strategies in place, but   even they have limits. The first is the unstaking \nprocess I mentioned earlier. Normally unstaking   takes about 28 hours. But this period lengthens \nas more validators join the queue since there's   a daily withdrawal limit. In fact, in September \n2024, the exit Q hit its longest ever at around   46 days, almost 7 weeks. Crazy, right? Still, this \nsystem buys Ethereum some time, helping to limit   the impact on network security, availability, \nand ETH's price. However, network participants   would need to use this time wisely, acting \nquickly to prevent further damage. Custodians,   issuers, and holders would have to cooperate \nrather than follow their own self-interest to   stop the Ethereum blockchain from descending \ninto chaos. And let's be real, the chances of   widespread cooperation in that scenario are about \nas likely as Nick revealing himself as Satoshi   Nakamoto. News flash, he isn't. At least not that \nI know of. But let's say everyone did agree to   cooperate. The safest way to avoid the impact of \nEthereum's impending collapse would be to bridge   assets to another blockchain before the attack. But even then, three problems would arise. First,   bridges are notorious for their smart contract \nvulnerabilities with many having been hacked or   exploited. On top of that, these smart contracts \nmight not handle such a massive capital shift. Second, coordinating market participants isn't \nas simple as sending a quick message. Ethereum is   highly decentralized with users worldwide across \ndifferent time zones speaking multiple languages. Getting everyone to act in unison would be \nan insane challenge on its own. And third,   over $75 billion is locked in DeFi protocols at \nthe time of shooting this video, many with unique   governance rules that determine how quickly ETH \ncan be withdrawn. As an alternative, some whales,   exchanges, and stablecoin issuers could try to \nintervene to support ETH's price, sort of like   a safety net. But as the report notes, even this \nwould be faced with problems, especially if the   confidence crisis was caused by Ethereum being \ninferior to another blockchain or if problems   can't be fixed quickly. Okay, then now that \nwe've covered what could happen on the way down,   the question now is what would happen if Ethereum \nwere to hit rock bottom and ETH were to go to   zero. Well, the report notes that one possible \noutcome is that ETH suffers a staggered fall   from grace with a few partial recoveries here and \nthere. It explains that the Ethereum Foundation,   the nonprofit guiding Ethereum's development, \nalong with large corporate stakers, could buy   enough ETH to keep validators running. This would \nkeep the network operational for weeks or even   months. However, this wouldn't restore investor \nconfidence, and many would still sell their ETH,   likely at significant losses. Not to mention that \nEthereum would become extremely centralized."

This would keep the network operational for weeks or even months. However, this wouldn't restore investor confidence, and many would still sell their ETH, likely at significant losses. Not to mention that Ethereum would become extremely centralized. The   report also notes that if whales, exchanges, and \ntoken issuers moved assets crosschain, it wouldn't   happen instantly. During the process, the bridges \nthey use would be prime targets for hackers. In fact, sustained attacks could even cause \ntokenized RWAS to dep. Think stable coins dropping   well below $1 or tokenized real estate trading \nfar below its real world value. And of course,   the money locked in DeFi protocols would be pretty \nmuch wiped out either due to sudden withdrawals   or the massive liquidations of projects or \ninvestors that took out leverage positions. Now, in the event that a 51% attack were indeed \nto happen, the first line of defense would be   to freeze assets on chain. This is something that \ncentralized stablecoin issuers already do, and you   can learn more about that in the video right over \nhere. The report notes this could help prevent   malicious activity like double spending, where \nan attacker tricks the blockchain into accepting   the same transaction twice. That said though, \nfreezing assets would be highly controversial and   would only further erode confidence, causing even \nmore long-term damage. And as a final measure, the   Ethereum Foundation could intervene with a hard \nfork. This would reverse illicit transactions, but   would also signal defeat, likely driving investors \naway to alternative chains without the same   issues. So to wrap up, the report notes that while \nEthereum is used as its main example, these risks   apply to any permissionless blockchain with its \nown token ecosystem, whether that's Salana, Tron,   BNB chain, or many others. But because Ethereum \nhas the second largest market cap and is the   largest ecosystem in crypto, its collapse would \ncause the most damage. For policy makers, though,   the picture isn't so clear. Some Tradfi players \nlean towards permission chains where only approved   players can run validators and unbacked cryptos \naren't involved. This makes regulatory compliance   easier, but these systems are more expensive \nthan public chains like Ethereum. However, the   report adds that while permissionless chains can \nbe steered by groups like the Ethereum Foundation,   they are decentralized by nature and therefore \nnot ideal for tradi infrastructure. Moreover,   they add that central banks can't be expected to \nprop up cryptos issued on these chains. Recall   that this report was written by Italy's central \nbank. And with that, we've reached the end of this   report. And we'll remind you that you can find \nthe whole thing in the description below. For   now though, you're probably wondering how likely \nit is that ETH could in fact go to zero. Well,   the short answer is not very likely at all. While the report raises multiple concerns   worth considering, they're honestly overblown. As mentioned earlier, attacking a major chain   like Ethereum would require a bad actor to control \nover 50% of the network. This would cost billions   of dollars in ETH alone, not to mention the \ncosts for the hardware needed to pull it off. This is why decentralization is such a powerful \nsecurity measure. and Ethereum just so happens   to be one of the most decentralized blockchains \nin the world, second only to Bitcoin. In short,   malicious validators aren't breaking Ethereum \nanytime soon. You may also be wondering if   a competing chain like Salana could overtake \nEthereum with its speed and efficiency, but there   are three major obstacles here. First, Salana has \na spotty track record for going offline. Second,   it doesn't dominate key corners of the crypto \nindustry like Ethereum does. And third,   and perhaps most importantly, Salana's speed comes \nat the cost of decentralization. That's not to say   that Salana is centralized per se, but it's not \nas decentralized as Ethereum. Salana has a few   thousand active validators, while Ethereum has \nalmost a million active validators at the time   of shooting. That is a huge difference. And not \nonly that, but investor and validator confidence   in Ethereum is actually incredibly strong, \nat least in recent months."

Salana has a few thousand active validators, while Ethereum has almost a million active validators at the time of shooting. That is a huge difference. And not only that, but investor and validator confidence in Ethereum is actually incredibly strong, at least in recent months. Case in point,   Ethereum's validator exit queue recently hit zero, \nwhich literally means no validators are going   offline. At the same time, demand for ETH staking \nhas soared. If that doesn't spell confidence,   then, well, I don't know what does. In fact, this \nconfidence shows up in the charts, too. Sure,   the October 2025 liquidations cut ETH's rally \nshort, but ETH has nonetheless been hitting higher   lows since the spring. And indeed, ETH has been \non an uptrend on its BTC pair since April last   year and may be about to break a major resistance \nzone. With Bitcoin dominance gradually declining   since June 2025, this suggests capital is rotating \ninto ETH, albeit gradually. And most importantly,   institutions are desperate to tokenize their real \nworld assets. But to do this, they want the most   reliable, secure, and liquid smart contract \nblockchain. It's no wonder then that Ethereum   hosts the lion share of RWAS. And as Ethereum \nrolls out major hard fork upgrades like the recent   Fusaka upgrade and the upcoming Glamsterdam, \nit becomes an even more attractive option for   institutional and retail investors alike. And by \nthe way, you can learn more about those upgrades   in the video right over here. Now, I could go \non, but I think you get the point. Ethereum   isn't going to zero today, tomorrow, or anytime \nsoon. In fact, it seems to be doing the opposite. With every upgrade and development, Ethereum \ngrows stronger, and it's only a matter of time   before ETH's price reflects this. So, yes, this \nreport was definitely worth the read. And yes,   these scenarios are possible hypothetically at \nany rate. In practice, though, it's probably best   to take this report with a huge, and I mean huge, \ngrain of salt. Okay, folks, that's enough from me,   though. Now, it's time to hear from you. Are \nyou worried about Ethereum's future or are   you stacking ETH as we speak? Let us know in the \ncomments below. If you're wondering where all the   retail investors are, then check out the video \nover here. And if you're wondering which crypto   narratives you should be watching closely in \n2026, well, you can find out in this video right   over here. Okay, thank you all for watching and \nI'll see you again soon. This is Guy signing off."
