      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coinb Trading. Today, we're going to talk about why the small pullback is almost over and which altcoins you should be watching when the crypto market continues powering higher. This is the kind of content that you enjoy. Then, be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different, and if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, I want to start off guys with a throwback to the video that I did on Monday where I had actually specified that my base case was a small pullback in the coming days because of course the crypto market had been going up I think for around six days uh straight at that point. A standard pullback was of course expected. You can check this again this video on Monday January 5th and literally the title of that section is small pullback as base case. I probably should have mentioned that in yesterday's video about Ethereum exploding higher because of course the moment I posted that video then we got that pullback and everyone's saying oh you're wrong. You're wrong. But it doesn't change the fact that I do think Ethereum is going to explode higher. Uh and again later on in the video, we'll take a look at which altcoins could benefit. Uh not just just not just Ethereum, but other altcoins later in the video, as well as why as to why there was a small pullback or why that pull that small pullback was likely. Of course, it had to do with the CME gap on Bitcoin, which has been filled at the time of shooting, at least the first CME gap here that was left over the weekend. Uh what's really interesting, guys, is that this second CME gap here that's down lower around 88,100. Uh this CME gap basically happened over New Year's and for those of you guys who don't know the reason why these CME gaps are closed, it's it doesn't have anything to do with emotions. It doesn't have anything to do with traders. It has to do it's basically a mechanical uh thing that's related to an inst well I guess technically a trade it's related to an institutional trade. Basically a basis trade where institutions are basically trading on the CME and using a spot Bitcoin ETFs. And one thing that I mentioned on Monday that's kind of interesting is that it's possible that this uh first CME gap here uh that you know this lower CME gap here around 88,100 it's possible that it won't be closed because it's possible that the dynamics for CME gaps over holidays are different than the dynamics over weekends. With that being said, I should note that officially, you know, like basically the textbook explanation of CME gaps is that it doesn't matter uh if they happen over a weekend or over a holiday day. Uh those CME gaps still get closed regardless. Uh and of course that would be kind of consistent with the target that I had specified in Monday's video that we would see uh Bitcoin, Ethereum and most cryptos fall back uh to uh basically retest the uh the daily Ballingerband moving average here which is currently around 89,100 to see a little bit of a deviation below that to fill that CME gap for Bitcoin would be completely normal and that would be a standard small pullback in an otherwise uh you know continued uptrend which has arguably been uh in in progress since the end of December. Uh similar idea here for Ethereum. There was no CME gap over the weekend, which is pretty interesting. But of course, there is a CME gap still down here from uh from January 1st. You can see the CME gap is currently somewhere around 3,000. If we look at Ethereum uh on the daily chart, you can see that a pullback for ETH back to the daily Ballinger band moving average would be around 3,000, which again is consistent with what I had mentioned in this video on Monday. So again, maybe another small pullback later today. Still possible. Whether it happens or it doesn't, I don't think it changes the fact that crypto prices are going to be going higher. And also I guess uh also to address the elephant in the room here. ETHBTC had been pointing that out yesterday."

And also I guess uh also to address the elephant in the room here. ETHBTC had been pointing that out yesterday. Everyone said, \"Oh my god, and the moment you posted ETBTC went down.\" Well, yeah, it just came down and like retested the Ballinger band moving average on the 4 hour, which is completely normal from a technical perspective. Maybe it'll chop around this range for a bit. Maybe it'll even have a little another uh deviation lower like it did back here a couple days ago. But then I do expect it to continue heading higher. Uh you know, pullbacks when crypto prices are going up, guys, are completely normal. And if you're not able to stomach those, then maybe crypto is not for you. So, when it comes to uh which altcoins to watch here once crypto prices do start powering higher, which I do think is going to happen as a result of the Clarity Act, as a result of the SEC's innovation exemption, as a result of the tariffs likely being struck down this Friday, uh as a result of the Fed likely easing in response to weakening economic data and a whole bunch of different stuff like that. Uh the two uh I guess narratives or niches, whatever you want to call them, technically niches because you know, you have like a niche which is stable coins and you have a narrative which is like payments or whatever. Anyway, uh the two to kind of watch here in the coming weeks will be stable coins and tokenized real world assets. Of course, you guys will know that search trends for terms like crypto and cryptocurrency have been at multi-year lows. What you guys might not know is that, as you can see here, search trends for stable coins and tokenization and other kind of like institutional terms like that have actually been skyrocketing over the last few months. And if we zoom in here to what's been going on over the last year, you can see that the drop off in interest in tokenization and stable coins that only really happen going into the holidays, which is what you would expect, right? Cuz people are going, you know, they're going on the holidays. They're not going to be checking and searching for stable coins or tokenization. They're going to be watching Home Alone and other movies like that, right? That's what they're going to be searching for. Um, but uh in all seriousness, what's really interesting is that, you know, this basically suggests to me that we actually could see an uptick in interest in stable coins and tokenization again, especially because you have so many institutions coming out and saying this is the main thing to watch in 2026. Uh, right here, Moody's, this ring rating agency, I think they said stable coins will become a core market plumbing in 2026. Uh we also have uh basically instit uh institutional analysts or whatever like Bernstein saying that tokenization super cycle is going to start this year which you know be be weary of that type of stuff. I don't think there's going to be a super cycle per se but it's definitely going to be entering the news again. So again that does suggest that this interest in stable coins and tokenization will start rising again. And you might think well why does that matter? You know stable coins tokenization how are altcoins going to benefit? Uh this is where things get really interesting. If you look at the correlation between search terms for stable coins, tokenization, and altcoins, you can see that they've been basically neck andneck, especially they were really highly correlated over the summer, that correlation kind of broke down going into the end of last year, of course, with the huge October uh 6 liquidation since that time. The interest in altcoins really took a hit. Uh but you can see that the correlation nonetheless remains pretty close."

The interest in altcoins really took a hit. Uh but you can see that the correlation nonetheless remains pretty close. So, riddle me this, what happens when you see uh you know, interest in stable coins and tokenization starting to rise? What do you think that's going to do in interest in altcoins? And it makes perfect sense, guys, because where is the stable coin and tokenization stuff happening? It's happening on altcoin chains. Of course, that brings me to the big question that I'm sure you're all wondering which altcoins to watch where the well the first one guys uh in case you've been living under a rock is of course Ethereum because most of the stable coin supply most of the tokenized real world assets are on Ethereum. Uh so, you know, don't be surprised that you start to see uh more inflows and more interest in Ethereum in the coming weeks that when we do get a bounce, you know, out of this pullback, which you know, could already be over. Maybe it'll happen. Maybe it'll continue for another day. Certainly possible. But in the next couple of weeks with the Clarity Act and with the SEC Innovation Exemption and all these different things coming up for crypto and also with a more positive macro backdrop, um you know, you you're going to see Ethereum probably outperforming Bitcoin, which again can be confirmed in the ETHBTC chart, uh which is probably going to continue powering higher in the next few days. Um but anyways, uh looking again at the real world asset rankings, uh you know, looking at the chains here, you can see that Salana is up here as well. Salana has actually been gaining even though you can barely see Salana here on the stable coin. Uh this is you know the supply of stable coins on different chains. You can see that Ethereum has the lion share again but of course Salana is up there as well. And not only that but the growth of stable coins on Salana has been very quick. There's been a lot of institutions deploying stable coins on Salana. Uh another one of course to watch is Bass although Bass doesn't have a token. It would be more like Coinbase stock. Um but uh besides that you know in terms of cryptos to watch Ethereum and Salana and then think of all the different uh you know adjacent crypto projects and tokens that are on Ethereum and Salana because what a lot of pe what a lot of people don't understand guys is that when Ethereum pumps when Salana pumps this pushes up the prices of tokens in their respective ecosystems. So if you have let's say for example I don't know I'll just use a just a simple example imagine you have like ono finance right which is like a a token on ethereum that's also doing tokenized real world assets that suggests that ono finance would do much better than say I don't know some tokenization protocol uh on polygon for example or on apttodos right um then uh then same idea when it comes to stable coins you know maybe there's some stable coin payment protocol or whatever on salana that's probably going to do way better than a stablecoin payment protocol on let's say I don't know Avalanche right and uh so that's you know One thing to kind of keep in mind is to focus on those uh crypto projects that fall into this stable coin and tokenization niche uh and especially to focus on narratives you know like divided into narratives like payments and like tokenized real estate and to focus on tokens in Ethereum's and Salana's ecosystem that fall into those kind of a hot narratives. So again, the niche is like high level stable coins tokenization. Narrative is like tokenized real world assets, stable coin payments and stuff like that."

So again, the niche is like high level stable coins tokenization. Narrative is like tokenized real world assets, stable coin payments and stuff like that. And to look for cryptos that fit into those categories that are in Ethereum and Salana's ecosystem. I believe those are the ones that will perform the best here uh in the coming weeks. And if you guys are going to be trading crypto in the coming weeks, then do check out the link in the description here, especially this first link here, uh BitGet up to 50,000 USDT deposit bonus. When you click on that link, it'll take you to a page that looks like this. You guys will notice that the coin bureau does have a partnership with BitGet. But on a personal note, I do think that BitGet is an awesome exchange. It's one that I use personally. That does not mean that you should be keeping crypto on exchanges, whether it's BitGet or any other exchange. Always keep your crypto in your personal wallets.
