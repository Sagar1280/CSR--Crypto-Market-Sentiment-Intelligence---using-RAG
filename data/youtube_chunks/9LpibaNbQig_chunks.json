      "text": "Yo, welcome everyone and happy new year. Bitcoin's next big move is probably coming very soon. That's why make sure you're ready. Let me show you now. First, you're going to see Bitcoin, yes, is once again trying to get a major breakout out of our descending triangle. In the past, we already got the first fake out right here. Major push down. Another some kind of a fake out. Or we can also say it was only a bullish retest of our trend line resistance right here. And right now, Bitcoin is once again trying to get another push back towards the upside. My long trades, yes, at least as of right now, they're still being in a profit. The long trade on Bitcoin approximately 18% and also the long trade on XRP approximately 8.75%. The short rate on Bitcoin however probably if we are going to start pushing even higher is going to get stopped out at the break even at approximately $9,000. So right now for Bitcoin is really a decision point. Are we going to be able to get another bigger push towards the upside and actually continue higher or simply is this entire move right here actually a fake out? What we can right now do let's go with the volume indicator where we are right now going to see that on the 2hour time frame. Unfortunately with the entire push towards the upside or we can simply say with this entire price action we are not getting any volume coming through. Yes, Bitcoin for the past few hours it is getting a bounce towards the upside. However, volume is going lower and lower and lower not only on the 2-hour time frame but also what if we zoom out on the 4hourly. It literally it is the exact same story. volume going lower and lower and lower and also not only on buy bit. What if we go right now on the Coinbase chart? Overall speaking the volume is not coming through on the entire move towards the upside. That is right now why even though yes it looks like we are breaking our descending triangle. The area where we are at the moment at least in my opinion is not really a good level where we can be looking for another long orb position. Yes, later in the video I'm even going to go through Ethereum and XRP technical analysis because both of them are right now trading at a very important level. But nevertheless, paying right now attention only to the Bitcoin chart. Yes, a good thing is we are right now apparently breaking our descending triangle. Not only that, we are also breaking a significant trend line area of resistance when we are connecting all of our lower highs on the daily time frame. Yes, it looks like we are getting some bullish indications but unfortunately the breakout is not really confirmed because simply volume is not coming through. That is"

Not only that, we are also breaking a significant trend line area of resistance when we are connecting all of our lower highs on the daily time frame. Yes, it looks like we are getting some bullish indications but unfortunately the breakout is not really confirmed because simply volume is not coming through. That is why I do remain right or still in my short trade on Bitcoin just in case we are going to get another major push towards side maybe even in the next few days. Also right now pay attention to what other people are right now doing in the market. That is why we should really pay attention to what the CVD indicator right here, the yellow line is actually happening in a comparison to the Bitcoin price. What you can right see lower low on our CVD indicator, higher low on Bitcoin. Technically speaking and theoretically speaking, this right here is a major bullish Bitcoin indication. Significant lower low on the CVD. It simply means more selling pressure is coming in the market, but Bitcoin is still pushing towards the upside. So this right here is going to be a bullish divergence, bullish absorption, bullish Bitcoin indication. However, I would say like that in the past few times when we got such a significant bullish divergence, this right here was actually a bearish Bitcoin indication and we got not a push toward the upside, but actually a major push down. So looking right now on the CVD, yes, technically speaking is a massive bullish indication, but looking right now in the past, I definitely would right now still be slightly more careful and definitely not really enter a brand new long trade at the area where we are as right now. However, once we go right now with our volume indicator, the picture is going to become slightly more clear because all we have to do right here is to actually pay attention to only one level. Remember for the past few days we have been paying attention not only towards our SNA channel right here but also we have been trading in quite an important horizontal range and with our range what are the most important levels simply measuring right now the entire range with volume you're right now going to see value area high of the range is getting a break towards the upside. So what we can right to say above our volume level we are slightly more bullish looking potentially for another push towards the upside at least towards our next area of resistance. Of course if we get a rejection acceptance once again below our value area high bearish indication in this scenario we are"

Of course if we get a rejection acceptance once again below our value area high bearish indication in this scenario we are going to look for lower targets. Very simple rule to follow very easy level for you to pay attention to. But at least as of right now yes we are above the value area high right here. We are getting technically a bullish indication on the CVD indicator. However, we still need to know the volume is not really coming through. And that is also right now one of the reasons why I would really appreciate for you to smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible. And of course, also thank you for subscribing to the channel. Now, we also need to talk about our exponential moving averages. Let's right now go with our EMAs, not only on the 2hourly, but also on the 1 hour time frame. Yes, our 50 EMA is definitely right now above the 200 EMA. So on the 1 hourly, Bitcoin is also moving in a very nice uptrend on the 2-hourly. Also, in the next few hours, potentially we are going to get a bullish cross. 50 EMA is probably going to go above our 200 EMA. And this right here is also going to be another bullish Bitcoin indication on the 2hour time frame. Last time we got a bullish cross, it was literally almost exactly at the high. We got a cross for a brief moment but then simply Bitcoin got another major push down. So overall speaking when we do get a bullish cross on the 2-hourly it is simply going to mean we are in an uptrend on the 2hourly and also of course then on the 1 hourly but also then we still need to pay attention to the 4hourly exponential moving averages. Ideally we also get a bullish cross on the 4hourly. And if we are going to get a bullish cross on the 4hourly, definitely then is going to mean Bitcoin is moving in a significant uptrend on all three important time frames. Last time we got a bullish cross on the 4hourly time frame, it was actually back right here in October 2025. We got a bullish cross. Bitcoin then simply continued slightly higher back towards the upside taking the liquidity above the recent high. Overall speaking, a bullish cross is definitely going to be a bullish Bitcoin indication if potentially we are going to be able to get it literally in"

Bitcoin then simply continued slightly higher back towards the upside taking the liquidity above the recent high. Overall speaking, a bullish cross is definitely going to be a bullish Bitcoin indication if potentially we are going to be able to get it literally in the next few days. Also, right now, pay attention to our Bitcoin liquidation heat map. First of all, on the twoe time frame, at least as of right now, it is being more of a 50/50 move if Bitcoin goes up or if Bitcoin goes down. Looking right now at the liquidations below our recent lows, approximately 227 million of long trades are going to get wrecked if we do get a push down. Also, if we get a push towards the upside, slightly over 210 million of short trades are going to get liquidated. So, pretty much this specific chart on the twoe time frame is almost 50/50. Then going on the oneweek time frame, the story is going to change a little bit because bigger liquidations when we are zooming in on the one week is actually showing to us that we do have bigger liquidations exactly below our recent lows where approximately 140 million of long trades are going to get wrecked. on the weekly. This one right here unfortunately it is looking slightly more bearish than on the twoe time frame. So what we can right now say Bitcoin liquidation heat map overall speaking when we do combine the one week and also the twoe time frame it is going to be slightly more bearish simply because the oneweek time frame is showing more liquidations below our recent lows. And this liquidation cluster right here is unfortunately going to be some kind of a magnet for the Bitcoin price. Usually we want to rank the most amount of people before getting a bigger push towards the upside or a push towards the downside. And also right here, one of the most important thing I want to write to share with you in this specific video, pay attention to what Bitcoin has been doing for the past few days right here. We are simply forming a lot of higher lows. The first low right here, another higher low, another higher low right here, and then another higher low. What does that actually mean? It means a lot of liquidity below our recent lows and usually again we want to wreck as much people as possible before actually getting a bigger push towards the upside. So in our previous video we said Bitcoin does have only three liquidity levels. This right here was the first one. This right"

So in our previous video we said Bitcoin does have only three liquidity levels. This right here was the first one. This right here was the second one. This right here was the third one. But also right here right now we have another liquidity level at $87,000. Bitcoin right now really does have four major liquidity levels which of course unfortunately it is also going to be more of a bearish Bitcoin indication. But I would say like that if we are going to right now get another push down hitting our liquidity levels right here definitely we could be looking to enter another long trade but only after we do get some kind of a reaction back towards the upside. And more about the trading ideas slightly later. right now.

Right now, let's also talk about another more of a local support level that in my opinion it's not as nice one as the liquidity level right here, but actually it was confirmed only a few hours ago. What we are right now going to do, let's go on the daily time frame where we are right now going to see Bitcoin does have the first daily support level at $87,500. And this specific daily support level right here actually does this align very nicely with another important level. what we could write to do. Let's go with our fixed range volume profile measuring the entire bottom price action right here with the volume. You're going to see point of control coming in almost exactly at our daily level. So definitely this specific area is going to be more of a local support level on Bitcoin. But in my opinion and usually because Bitcoin really likes to take the liquidity, I would definitely say sure you could pay attention towards the daily and the point of control. But the better price target is definitely going to be our major liquidity zone right here. exactly below our recent"

But the better price target is definitely going to be our major liquidity zone right here. exactly below our recent close. Also, right now, what if we are not going to get a push towards the downside, but actually another push towards the upside? What is going to be the first important resistance level where potentially, of course, yes, I'm going to look to fire another short trade. If Bitcoin right now does go just slightly higher towards the upside, I'm going to get stopped out out of my short trade on Bitcoin right here. That is why I'm going to hold no short trades on the entire crypto market. But of course, I still want to be prepared in a case we are going to go lower. So, I'm going to look for another short trade at another important area of resistance, especially if the entire move towards the upside is still going to be happening on a very low volume. Similarly, what has rightly been happening for the past few days right here. That is why what we rightly need to do, let's go on the two-hourly Fibonacci retracement from the high right here back towards the low. Golden Fibonacci ratio coming in at approximately $91,000. And also right here, as you probably already know, Bitcoin does have another important volume level when we are measuring the entire price action right here. Value area high coming in almost exactly at our golden Fibonacci ratio. But of course also if we go higher, we have the first liquidity level right here, the second liquidity level and then of course also the third liquidity level. Another important level you should really pay attention to Bitcoin is simply going to be this specific area because simply of course we can write to continue higher take the liquidity above the recent highs hit the area of resistance and only then do get a bigger push down taking also the liquidity below our recent lows. So the plan of Bitcoin right now is very very simple. Overall speaking we can right now actually say it's pretty much 50/50 if Bitcoin moves up or if Bitcoin moves down. But this right here is not the point. The most important question we always need to ask ourselves is simply where we are prepared to buy or where we are prepared to sell. And at this specific area at the gold Fibonacci ratio, I'm simply going to look to potentially fire a brand new short trade"

And at this specific area at the gold Fibonacci ratio, I'm simply going to look to potentially fire a brand new short trade if there is going to be a nice reaction back down or simply if Bitcoin does get a push down. And of course, we need to then get a reaction back towards the upside above our recent loss right here for then also us to be looking to fer another long or a buy trade. Very simple plan. One of them probably is actually going to play out literally in the next few days, maybe even in the next few hours. But nevertheless, we know right now exactly what two levels are the most important ones. Also, right here, pay attention to Ethereum because Ethereum right now, yes, it does look like it is also getting a push towards the upside. But what is going to be the most important level you should really pay attention to. Remember, the most important Fibonacci ratio is always going to be the golden pocket. So, we go right here from the high back towards the low. golden Fibonacci ratio coming in at approximately $3,200 US. Also right here we can identify another liquidity level exactly above our recent high but also again fixed range volume profile measuring the entire bottom price action with volume value area high coming in exactly at this specific area. I would say that if Ethereum does get that big of a push up, this specific area of resistance is definitely a very important level where right now I am definitely also going to set an alert at because if it's going to get hit, nice reaction back down. I'm also going to look to fire another short trade on Ethereum exactly at this specific area. Also, what about XRP? Because XRP right now, at least on the 4hour time frame, we started closing some of the candles above our trend line area of resistance. how I'm making the trend line here. Let's go on the line chart because you're going to see I'm connecting the candle closes, that being said, all of the lower highs on the 4hour time frame. And at least as of right now, yes, XRP is really trying to break it back towards the upside. So this right here, theoretically speaking, is a bullish indication for XRP.

That is why if you're looking for a breakout trade right here, definitely you still need to have proper risk management stop-loss probably below our trend line area of support in a case everything is going to get a major push towards upside for XRP. Personally, I'm not really interested in a short trade but definitely I am looking for a short trade on Ethereum right here and also Bitcoin of course at our very important area of resistance if right now it is going to get hit maybe even in the next few hours.
