      "text": "Venezuela is sitting on an estimated $17 trillion worth of untapped crude. >> Everybody's watching Venezuela's oil, but the real story is with Venezuela's Bitcoin. >> All right, I want to talk to you about Venezuela a bit. You've done some reporting on this. Venezuela has been an early adopter of crypto as a currency and use of it. Official data shows that Venezuela holds 240 Bitcoin, around 22 million, but multiple analysts confirm a much larger shadow reserve, bigger exposure. >> But the the other side of this is the fact that the there are multiple reports that the government itself has been looking to evade sanctions by doing sales of oil in Tether, which they then move into Bitcoin. And if you're asking why, >> for going back a decade now, my reporting was back in 2017, because of spiraling inflation of the bully bar, a lot of people had turned to cryptocurrencies, mining Ethereum and Bitcoin in their homes in order to just have a a stable source of u of cash. In fact, here's a clip on Fox Business from eight years ago, the collapse of Venezuela as Maduro announced that he would launch his own altcoin backed by oil, quote unquote, in order to buy hard assets, buy things like gold and Bitcoin. >> Shambles, that country's president, Nicholas Maduro, saying he will begin selling cryptocurrency, which is going to be backed by now. His government claims that 100 million petrol dollars are going to be worth $6 billion. It it sounds like a crazy long shot. Is there any [laughter] chance of this working? >> Well, that's all he's got left is crazy long shots. I mean, with the the the country is facing 13,000% inflation, according to the IMF in 2018, that's 1.5% an hour. So, here's the pros and the cons. The people of Venezuela have been mining Bitcoin for a long time as a way to try and get around government, the Maduro government, for them to trade and to and to store store value and buy stuff in this hyperinflationary scenario. What the people of Venezuela don't want is for the Maduro regime to get their own cryptocurrency so that they can continue indebting the country and stay in power. So, as it stands today by country, the United States has over 207,000 Bitcoin. China, even though it's a banned to the people, the government, has over 190,000 Bitcoin. Bhutan, they were an early adopter many years ago. El Salvador has been buying since 2020. Dubai just came in the rankings. I I mean, the UAE. And even though Venezuela reported to hold 240 Bitcoin in the books, what they reported, what the data doesn't show, multiple analysts estimate a much larger shadow reserve as they acquired BTC via gold swaps. They sold oil and settled in USDT. Of course, years ago, you couldn't swap that into anything but Ethereum, but Bitcoin. And they've been accumulating since 2018. But who controls the Bitcoin now? Venezuela's because we know since the United States took took over who controls Venezuela's oil now >> we're going to keep it >> we're keeping it >> either it is lost forever which is good for price because if it's lost forever then it can never go on the market it can never be sold if the BTC is seized or frozen rather than liquidated >> and so much of this market moves on sentiment so even the promise that perhaps the US government when they came in might seize these assets hold on to it that's a bull case for Bitcoin. If you have a stockpile such as that uh that isn't being liquidated, >> this may be how the United States can add Bitcoin to their strategic Bitcoin reserve in tax neutral ways without spending any money. >> Yesterday, I signed an executive order officially creating our strategic Bitcoin reserve. >> Now, we want as much Bitcoin as we can possibly accumulate. Now, obviously, we have to do that in these budget neutral ways. U but I think that there's many creative ideas out there that we can act on. And breaking news as if on Q. Very interesting. This story came out today. The Department of Justice for the US violated President Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve executive order by selling its forfeited crypto. Meaning if true, if true and we have the official documents, asset liquidation, so it looks to be true, from the Southern District of New York, leadership of Keon and William authorized the US Marshall Service to receive the Bitcoin account and then immediately liquidate in a manner dictated by the US Marshall Service. Now, how much Bitcoin was this? How much exactly did they sell?"

Now, how much Bitcoin was this? How much exactly did they sell? Well, Keon Rodriguez and William Hill agreed to transfer Bitcoin worth approximately $6 million, which is referred to then as thus as the Bitcoin utilizing the previous day's close close price as identified by Yahoo Finance after the agreement is signed from this account Bitcoin address. So, this is a violation of Donald Trump's direct executive order that they will keep the Bitcoin the US already has. But this is only $6 million worth. That's about 64 Bitcoin in total that the US apparently sold. That's about 1/4th of what Venezuela is confirmed to have. And if Venezuela does wasn't honest when they actually reported how much they actually own, the hundreds of thousands Bitcoin exposure is either lost, which is good for price, is either seized for the United States, which then I would presume go into the reserve, which is good for price. >> We're a big inflection point right now for digital assets, Bitcoin especially. If you look at the regulatory clarity that's come into the system over the past year, uh it's just it's a whole new ball game. uh head of the SEC said a couple weeks ago that capital markets are all moving on chain. Uh Jamie Diamond has reversed course. They're now building on blockchain. So all of this is massively positive for Bitcoin, which looks like it's put in a higher base than it did in the spring of 25. The technicals are really starting to line up and it looks like it's ready to go again. I personally expect it to break out to a higher high than its all-time high from the vault. And just in, the Black Rockck BTC ETF pulls their largest inflow. Black Rockck Spot Bitcoin ETF pulled in $287 million in a single day. It's largest inflow in nearly 3 months. Pay attention to not just what they say. Pay attention to what they do. >> You're back on the horse of predicting Bitcoin. Even though it didn't work out last year, your your numbers were not hit. Maybe analysts like Tom Lee about Bitcoin weren't wrong. Maybe they were just early. >> You know, it's like, no, I I would not say that you're a terrible financial advisor based on trying to predict Bitcoin. I don't know who could could do that. So, I'm not going to hold your feet to the fire, but as I said, you're getting right back on the horse. 250 250,000. >> Yeah. You can bleep me out, too, if I just say the number. Um, >> yeah, that'd be good for that. That we don't care. I'm trying to protect you. Uh yeah, 250 >> 250 thou not $250, which some people still have. That's a >> Tom Lee says that Bitcoin could reach over $250,000 in 2026, which by the way is what he said about the end of 2025 if the four-year cycle breaks. >> Uh yeah, in 2026, if Bitcoin gets to 200 or 250,000, it would be breaking the four-year cycle. Um, so that's sort of part of our view is that this, you know, if you follow the four-year cycle, Bitcoin should be down this year. But I think that there are tailwinds that are building and part of it as we kind of reset leverage on October 10th with that big shock, >> right? >> And now I think there is still institutional adoption taking place and Wall Street is still building a lot of products on the blockchain and then we have US government support. So, I think these are tailwinds that help Bitcoin recover this. >> And love him or hate him, right now, Tom Lee through his company Bitine is practicing what he preaches. Bit mine now holds over 4.1 million Ethereum, about 3.4% of the total supply. And of course, he is down."

Bit mine now holds over 4.1 million Ethereum, about 3.4% of the total supply. And of course, he is down. Bit is sitting on an unrealized loss of $3.5 billion. Even though people have pointed out the divergence from gold and silver, you think with gold and silver doing well, eventually Bitcoin benefits from that trade. >> Yeah. Uh it does look like gold rallies typically lead Bitcoin rallies. So I think it's been healthy for gold to rally. Um part of it, you know, dollar debasement and now with monetary easing, >> those are things that are supportive of crypto to follow. And as you know, crypto adoption rates are still quite low. So, crypto has sort of an exponential growth opportunity because the adoption is increasing.

And I will be back tomorrow with another video, keeping you informed about crypto. Going to be a great year."
