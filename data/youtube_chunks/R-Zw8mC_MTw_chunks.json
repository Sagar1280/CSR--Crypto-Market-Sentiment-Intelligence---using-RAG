      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coin Bureau Trading. Today, I'm going to tell you why I believe Q1 is going to be bullish for the crypto market. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different. And if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, in case you guys missed it, I did a actually 2026 prediction video here on January 1st. And what I basically explained there was that I do expect Q1 of 2026 to be bullish. Of course, the question there is how bullish will Q1 be, right? Will it just be a rally to lower highs or will there be a rally to higher highs? And the honest answer, guys, is in the short term. I'm still not sure about that. But I do think at the very minimum, we're going to see Bitcoin rallying to the Ballingerband moving average on the weekly to retest that level. That's currently somewhere around $101,000 uh and similarly for Ethereum. I do there expect there to be a rally at least to somewhere around 3500 3600. And if we do see Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies get above this key resistance level, then we could actually be looking at higher highs in Q1. But we're going to have to take things one step at a time, especially if you're trading the market. Again, short-term target here in the next few weeks. Uh at least somewhere up to around 101,000 for Bitcoin and somewhere to around 35 3600 for Ethereum. Uh, with that out of the way, I want to kind of dig into the reasons why I believe Q1 will be bullish, especially because the reasons for that are kind of becoming clearer by the day, if that makes any sense. So, just to quickly recap, Q1 includes obviously January, February, and March. And what I'm basically saying is that during January, February, andor March, we're going to see crypto prices trending higher overall. And again, is that going to be a lower high or a higher high? Still too too soon to say, but it is becoming apparent what the catalyst for this rally in the next few months is going to be. And the first of these guys actually has to do with something that could have happened by the time you see this video, and that's the fact that the Trump administration is planning on limiting uh interest rates on credit card debt to around 10%. I've heard that there was like discussions with banks that maybe it would be closer to 15%. This is expected to be implemented by Tuesday of this week, so like a few days ago. It's possible that it wasn't implemented right away, but the interesting thing is is that there is political support uh for this policy on the left and the right. Of course, uh even going up into the midterms, there's lots of focus on trying to lower costs for consumers. And of course, the practical effect of lowering uh interest rates on credit card debt to around whatever it is going to be 10% 15% is that there's going to be more money left over for people to spend uh which of course means more money uh invested into the markets, more money spent into the economy uh which would be basically bullish for for let's say for market liquidity, for economic liquidity overall. So, and that's just the first reason or I guess one one catalyst to watch. Another one is coming up here in uh in February, in early February, and that's bigger tax refunds. Uh I guess just to quickly recap, the Trump administration of course had passed this big beautiful bill last year. Uh and if memory serves, within that bill, there was basically some uh kind of like tax cuts uh to basically average Americans. And it's estimated that the the size of the tax refund on average could be around $1,000 or or more per person. And to put things into perspective, guys, the uh the stimi checks from 2020, the initial round of stimi checks was also roughly around I think it was 1,200 or 1,400 per person. So we could see a basically similarly sty check sized uh you know like liquidity injection or or cash handout or whatever you want to call it."

So we could see a basically similarly sty check sized uh you know like liquidity injection or or cash handout or whatever you want to call it. Um and again this is something that is going to start in February as these tax refunds uh basically start being sent out you know in early February into midFebruary which again does fall into Q1. Same idea with lowering interest rates uh to 10% for these credit cards. you know, it's probably going to happen in the next couple of months here, either in January or February. Uh maybe it'll take until March, who knows? And that's just in terms of kind of like liquidity catalysts. There's also kind of like liquidity factors, like things that are actively impacting the markets right now. And one of these guys is the Treasury General account. Uh as you guys will know, the Treasury General account is basically the US uh government's account at the Federal Reserve. And when the Treasury General account is being drained, that's positive for liquidity. And you guys will know that since around November, October, whatever you know, period you want to be exact here of last year, around late October, early November, we started to see the Treasury general account drained. And that means that ever since November of last year, we've started to see kind of more liquidity flow into the economy and the markets as a result of the Treasury general account being drawn down. At the same time, you guys will know that starting around December, we started to see the the Fed's balance sheet expand as the Fed started basically increasing uh well, it was started basically buying back 40 billion I think roughly of bills of bonds every single month and people are saying, \"Oh, it's not QE. It doesn't count as QE.\" But as you can see, yes, the Fed's balance sheet is expanding and that is basically a positive for global liquidity. But the catch of course is guys that crypto lags liquidity by around 3 months. So this liquidity uh basically increase from the Treasury general account from November and the liquidity increase from the Fed starting in December, those act with a three-month lag. And if you you know you add three months to that, you basically end up in February March time frame where these liquidity these positive liquidity flows from the Treasury General account and from the Fed. They will only start impacting the crypto market sometime around February and March which again fits into that Q1 window. Uh, and of course, one thing I do need to mention though is that this assumes that there will be a kind of a liquidity, let's say, injection into the crypto market because, as I've been pointing out for the last few months, guys, it looks like something could have broken in the crypto market over the summer of 2025 where even though global liquidity continued rising, it wasn't flowing into crypto for whatever reason. Uh, and I'm not sure if this factor is something that's been fixed. But one thing that kind of does give me some hope there is the fact that you've seen the Russell 2000 over the last few weeks finally breaking out. As you guys will know, the Russell 2000 is highly correlated to the crypto market. This basically is because the Russell 2000 like small cap stocks and uh and crypto are kind of all they're both further out the risk spect uh spectrum. So if we see that the Russell 2000 has been starting to rally here over the last couple of weeks and of course we have seen crypto prices pick up over the last few weeks as well. Obviously they haven't like exploded high or anything but we did see crypto prices bottom. They look like they're starting to recover. That is a further idea, I guess, further evidence of the idea that we're starting to see liquidity."

Obviously they haven't like exploded high or anything but we did see crypto prices bottom. They look like they're starting to recover. That is a further idea, I guess, further evidence of the idea that we're starting to see liquidity. All this macro liquidity is finally starting to flow out more out the risk curve. Another factor to watch there is the US dollar, which is measured using the dollar index, aka the DXY, aka the Dixie, whatever you guys want to call it. And you can see that yes, we did see, I guess, a small surge higher here in the US dollar over the last couple of weeks, but it looks like we're finally starting to see the US dollar roll over again. If the dollar continues rolling over, that's also going to be positive for liquidity in the short term. So again, on the macro front, we have basically interest rates on credit card debt probably being uh lowered, which will result in more money left over for people to spend. We'll have more uh money coming from tax refunds uh and that'll be of course going into account sometime in February. We have again the uh the draw down of the Treasury General account which started in November and the increase in the Fed's balance sheet which started in December which again three-month lag. You're looking at February March time frame for that liquidity flow into crypto. because of this three-month lag, there could potentially still be some kind of liquidity disconnect between uh crypto and the and basically global liquidity. However, the recent rally in the Russell 2000, as well as the kind of a kind of, you know, bottoming process we've seen in crypto and the fact that we're starting to see some signs of recovery in the crypto market, that is basically supportive of the idea that this macro liquidity is starting to flow into risk assets. And of course, the one thing that's kind of missing there is some kind of catalyst that would bring that attention and capital, you know, and very much concentrate it, let's say, into crypto. Uh, of course we do have the SEC's innovation exemption which is expected to be introduced by the end of this month. Hopefully that's happened by the time you guys have seen this video. And who knows, maybe it's been delayed again. Maybe they'll say, \"Oh, it'll actually be maybe next month or something.\" But for this to happen sometime in Q1, I think there's a very high likelihood of hap of that happening. And as you guys will know, the SEC's innovation exemption would basically temporarily legalize everything in crypto in the US, especially onchain activities like tokenized RWAs and DeFi uh and social fi and all these different uh kind of niches that have lots of regulatory uncertainty around them and has made it hard for there to be, you know, actual adoption and integration, innovation. I think you could see like banks, let's say, for example, launching more tokenized RWA, launching more stable coins. you could see uh even like social media companies uh launching stable coins or integrating with crypto protocols and integrating NFTTS and stuff like that, right? That's the type of stuff that this innovation exemption would kind of allow for. And of course, we also do have the Clarity Act, which currently at the time of shooting is still, you know, kind of on rocky waters, let's say, uh or whatever the term is. Um but, uh what's interesting is that, you know, even though many people are saying, \"Oh, Coinbase is the one that's blocking this.\" It does look like obviously it's in Coinbase's interest to make sure that the Clarity Act gets passed. It looks like they've still been working towards that. Uh and it looks like uh that will be happening in the again in the next few weeks assuming there's no government shutdown at the end of the month, which is, you know, another thing to keep in the back of your mind."

Um I do think that it's likely that the Clarity Act would be passed somewhere in the first couple of months here. Um if it's not, then it probably won't be passed, you know, until who knows when because like roughly when we are approaching like the March time frame, it's going to be very hard for there to be any kind of progress in Congress because all the focus is going to be on the midterms at that point. Um, so I'm hopeful that the Clarity Act is going to be passed here in the next couple of months. Um, but I do think that the SEC's innovation exemption is the more important thing to watch. This doesn't rely on any politicians. All we're waiting for is for Paul Atkins to, you know, stop smirking and start doing something here. Um, but uh, in all seriousness, yeah, like I do think that Q1 is looking really good for crypto and it's easy to forget guys that, you know, like this recent price action, it's basically just been chop since mid November. Uh, we are seeing again like signs of of higher lows ever since whatever it is here in in December. You can make the argument we've seen higher lows since November of last year. So this is in my view like signs that there's a recovery is underway. Does that mean prices are going to go up only tomorrow? No. But I do think that again that Q1 of 2026 is going to end up bullish. How bullish is that going to be? Again, we'll have to play things by ear. Um but uh yeah, and I'll be keeping you guys up to date there, I guess. And uh if this is the kind of analysis you guys like, then this is the type of analysis I'm doing every single day in the Coin Bureau Club. That's where we do deep dives into promising small cap and midcap altcoins. We've also started doing deep dives into like tokenized stocks and like you know commodities and a whole bunch of different things. Uh members get to vote on which assets and altcoins we review. We have a research feed where I'm sharing these types of insights. We have a team portfolio page where you can see which cryptos we're holding and which ones we're considering buying. We have an exclusive deals page where you can find deals on uh basically research platforms uh that can help you in your own crypto research. And we have a members Discord where you can ask us questions and discuss all these kinds of ideas and stuff. And again, the link to all of that will be down in the description. And if you guys did make it this far and you did find that information helpful, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, ding that notification bell, and I'll see you in the next"
