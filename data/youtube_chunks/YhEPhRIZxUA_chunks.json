      "text": "[music] All eyes on Powell. Bitcoin chops mostly sideways as markets await Wednesday's Fed meeting. That's not good. Digital asset treasuries were flavor of the month not so long ago, but it seems the market is now losing its taste for them. The big driver. We examine the main factor that will determine how markets perform next [music] year and whether the omens are good or bad. and a look at last week's top performers, tweets of the week, Lewis with the TA, a portfolio competition update, and much more besides. This is the Coin Bureau News Live. This is the Coin Bureau News Live. You are in the right place. Welcome everyone. It is great to see you again. My name is Guy and I am joined as ever by Nick. Hello, sir. >> There you go. How you doing? >> I'm all right, thanks. All right. >> Okay. How was your weekend? My weekend uh it was all right. I went to a Christmas drinks and overdid it on the drinks. Oh >> and uh Sunday was tough but as per usual >> yes I seem to be I seem to be stuck in a bit of a rut like that. It must be must be something to do with me not getting much joy from the crypto market. >> I don't think any of us are getting joy from the crypto market but some of us actually do some healthy stuff to get rid of our stress and release and >> you you had a nice whole suit again. Do you? >> I did but then I also think I caught I got a bit sick you know. I don't know what happened. Must have been from the crypto conference I was attending last week. Someone >> Yes. You know. >> Yes. We were at Binance Blockchain Week last week. >> Someone brought some germs and pass it on to me. >> Okay. That's where patient zero was. >> That's exactly why I don't go to We shouldn't go to crypto conferences. >> Okay. There you go. You never know what you're going to catch. Um so great great to see you everyone. Thanks for joining. Uh today, as we said in the headlines, we're going to kick off by talking about Bitcoin, as we always do, and uh then a couple of other things as well, including uh as we mentioned, uh that all important factor that we really need to be keeping an eye on for the sake of all our bags. But before we get into the meat of it, um don't forget to well, don't forget to subscribe if you for some reason have managed not to do that already >> and the bell of course, >> ring the bell and hit the like button. You will see just below Nick there, there is a little progress bar. If we get to 1,000 likes and 100% on that progress bar today, I will reveal some portfolio changes uh that I've either just made um or am considering making. I shared these with our Coin Bureau Club members uh earlier today. So, if you give us >> some trades you've also shorted he's also shorted some. >> I do have a couple of trades on. I'm not normally a trader, but you know, you've got to entertain yourself somehow in this market. So, >> copy trade guy, guys. Come on. >> Yeah. or you or or you could inverse me, which may be a good idea as well. But yeah, hit the like button and you will find out a bit later on if we get to 1,000 likes. Nick, is there any more housekeeping we need to do before we crack on? >> Don't forget, of course, about our portfolio competition, which I think is probably up on last week cuz you guys full ported into Bitcoin. That was at about 88 or 89K. So, you're slightly up. So, that portfolio competition is still ongoing. So hang around till the end of the stream if you want to participate this week and see where we're at in terms of what the value is at. >> Okay. And uh just one more point of housekeeping Brett. I'll let you get away with it once for mentioning the England cricket team. No more no more mentioning of England or cricket. >> No more mention of cricket ever in any streams ever going forward. Please make that a policy >> unless we win the next test. But uh yeah, I'll let you I'll let you off this time Brett, but I'm I'm keeping receipts. Okay. Uh what happened last week in Bitcoin, Nick? Well, if you recall on Monday, it was quite a shocker."

Well, if you recall on Monday, it was quite a shocker. Uh this was because our friends over there in Japan, UEA, the Japanese central bank governor uh basically caused the markets to crash because um there was expectations for rate cut potentially coming in the next few weeks and the markets adjusted and this brought back fe uh you know memories of the >> Japanese carry trade unwind of last year. >> Uh although to be fair it wasn't as bad as August. Um and the markets did duly recover uh in a day but but crypto took a bit longer to recover than the other markets. >> Surprise, surprise, >> surprise, surprise. Exactly. Um Sailor did come out on last week, Monday, and actually he announced this, not a Bitcoin buy, >> but a $1.44 billion cash reserve. Cash fiat. Can you imagine [clears throat] sailor stacking fiat instead of Bitcoin? >> Oh, he must feel so >> so dirty, right? He's has to go and shower after that, you know. >> He can't be like that. >> But anyways, this is the $ 1.44 billion uh reserve for dividends and interest, which we will talk a bit more about a bit later. >> Mhm. >> On Tuesday, can you believe this? Bank of America came out and they said they're going they recommending for their clients, their retail clients, uh 1 to 4% crypto allocation, uh and they could invest in these different products, uh FBTC, IBIT, Grayscales, Mini Trust, etc. So just Bitcoin products right now, but 1 to 4% is pretty large for the size of Bank of America's client base. >> Yeah. Now, it wasn't just Bank of America that we we kind of had a double whammy of holdouts uh finally breaking down last week because Vanguard as well. Now, these guys, you may remember when the spot bitcoin ETFs launched in January 24, these guys were like, \"No thanks. No, we're not touching it.\" Um, but they have finally caved. They've seen the absolutely obscene amounts of money that their the likes of Black Rockck have made from IBIT. >> Oh yeah, exactly. It's one of its most profitable product ever actually IBIT. So Vanguard is now offering this to their clients and you know the floodgates are slowly opening. Uh and Bitcoin did start recovering back above 90K on Tuesday. And speaking about IBIT actually this on this day you had the volumes on IBIT were insane. In fact, I think that um the volume actually speaking of Vanguard as well, the volume on IBIT actually exceeded the volumes on Vanguard's flagship S&P 500 ETF. >> Wow. >> It's crazy. >> Wow. Vanguard must be >> That's why that's why exactly. >> Okay. Um so yeah, we we it looked like we were getting a bit of good news. Um then uh weddednesday came and the news was certainly not good. We had uh weak ADP numbers. >> Exactly. So the ADP numbers, these are private payroll numbers. Uh and this was we saw them shed employers shed 32,000 jobs in November >> and this is actually the third consecutive negative print in or not a third negative print in the last four months. So you can see the trend there. It's not looking good on the employment front. >> No. And then actually this was confirmed the following day on Thursday when we had uh yet more layoff announcements. And this um NBC was saying uh yeah the highest level since the pandemic. >> Yeah. This is for the challenger survey as well. Another private payroll survey. Yeah, the largest since the pandemic level. So the job market's not looking too good. >> So I mean that you guess must be a kind of combination of economic uncertainty."

You know, obviously the tariffs and things like that, but also you kind of feel this must be AI playing a role as well. >> AI playing a role and that whole K-shaped economy, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> However, um amidst all the bad news, um someone was sticking to the script. Um uh Thursday uh was when the Binance Blockchain Week conference that was the first day, wasn't it? Was it the second day? >> No, it was the second day. >> It was the second day. Tom Lee um of uh Bitmine was one of the keynote speakers there and he was also uh obviously on uh uh CNBC where he likes to go. Um he was doubling down on his predictions, right? >> Yeah. 100K uh before the end of the year or all-time highs. So, you know, and he's also says the crypto markets have bottomed and uh I think he said also 120 150k by early next year. 250k by the end of next year. He had some crazy ETH predictions as well. >> Okay. >> So, >> and is this is this new alltime high in the room with us right now? >> I know. I'd love I'd love to know what his opium dealer is and maybe he can get some stash of that. >> Good for him. He's sticking to it. I hope he I hope he proves all of us naysayers wrong. And uh yeah, everyone will be happy. >> Everyone loves a comeback story, Tom. So, let's do it. >> Absolutely. Absolutely. You keep fighting for it, Tom. Um Friday uh the PCE uh came out. That was bang on expectations. Yep. Exactly. So thankfully no surprises there. >> Unfortunately, Bitcoin still fell below back below 89K. >> Oh, it's just it's just wobbling. And um we actually had uh we spoke about IBIT earlier. We then had its longest weekly outflow streak >> since launch. Yeah, pretty sure. Not ideal there. >> So um a bit like me, Bitcoin wasn't looking in great shape as it headed into the weekend. >> Yeah, exactly. Although it did pick up back above 91.5K overnight, but you know what they say, uh, never trust a Sunday pump because what happens on a Sunday pump, >> guy? What happens on a Sunday pump? >> Well, you know, I know I know the people in the comments want you to say it, Nick. But we get a CME gap. >> Guess who's back? Yep. The CME gap. [clears throat] >> Nick didn't. I saw people were saying how people were saying in the comments, \"How many minutes do you think until Nick mentions [laughter] a CME gap?\" >> Guys, it was me. I I have OCD. I can't have gaps in my chart. [laughter] >> Um anyways, what's coming up? So, FOMC week this week, big week. Um and 25 bips is basically baked in. We'll get to that in a bit. Uh on the charts, on the weekly chart, this isn't too good. Actually, this is um our fourth weekly close below the 50we moving average. Uh so, this is means that momentum is not on our side. And I'll note that the first time we had four weekly at least two to three weekly um closes below the 50we moving average was uh in January 2022 and we had a bit of a scam pump that was caused by FTX shenanigans in April May but then all into a bare market. So I don't know that's not looking too good from a momentum perspective. We as I said we did have on the daily chart we did have or the 4hour chart we did have a pump over the weekend but we opened up this gap I mentioned 89.4 4 to 89.8K."

We as I said we did have on the daily chart we did have or the 4hour chart we did have a pump over the weekend but we opened up this gap I mentioned 89.4 4 to 89.8K. We could potentially head a bit higher because there is a lot of liquidity above um as we go towards the uh Fed meeting or the FOMC. Although it is pretty much uh baked in uh 85% chance it's priced into the market. What we will be looking for in that meeting is forward guidance and whether the and how polarized the the Fed will be because apparently this is going to be the most contentious vote in terms of forward and against in the rate cuts. So yeah, very very like the governors themselves are basically so pitted against each other right now. So I think that that's what you're going to watch to see for their forward guidance. >> Okay. So I mean I kind of feel with the rate cut priced in unless Powell is kind of really dovish in his press conference afterwards. We're also getting the the SCP, aren't we? The summary of economic projections. >> That's the bright cuts for next year. Yeah. >> Yeah. So unless Powell is really dovish and cheerful after the uh after the at the FOMC press conference, which I I can't really see myself, we're probably going to sell off post that. Would you think? >> I think it could be a solo news event. Yeah, we'll have to see if he's super doubbish and they come out with massive projections and SCPs for next year, cuts in January and stuff maybe, but let's see. Anyways, if you guys are feeling bullish for the rate for the rate cut and you think that it could rally out of that or if you're indeed feeling bearish and you think it's going to be a hawkish cut, you would want to trade on bit.

Uh let's do a quick sentiment check. There's a few questions and a few people asking about Fed rate cuts. Um but uh yeah, I think we've I think we've just answered that. Um yes, Liz was saying, should we do a sweep stake on how many minutes until Nick mentions a CME gap? >> There you go. >> Um Brett and the cricket, which guy does Guy does not have a stain on it's not a stain. >> [laughter] >> It's a owl. >> It's a owl. You think I'm turning up to these things in like food stained clothes? Like >> I mean it would be it would be surprised you >> honestly. Um uh GM Canra Australia asks more cricket. Did you know Australia only took six days to win both tests? Are you embarrassed? Yes. And yes, I was I have been paying attention. Maybe we ban him from the stream. Um now uh we need to we need to confirm this. This isn't confirmed but apparently it is confirmed. Okay. Sailor has bought folks 10,624 Bitcoin. >> So where's that money come from that?"

Please don't tell me it's from the dividend reserve. Like [laughter] it's like he's like, \"Yo guys, I'm saving this up for a rainy day in case we need to pay dividends and interest. I can't I can't I just can't help myself.\" >> You imagine the finance director sort of tearing out of his office like, \"Michael, did you did you raid the dividend?\" [laughter] >> I don't know. Do we know how it was funded? Do any do we know? No. >> No. We'll we'll um we'll find out. But uh yeah. Okay. Well, you know, Sailor is not is is not stopping. >> What is the price doing? Let's see. Let's see what the price is doing. Um >> I I would imagine it hasn't done an awful lot. It's up a little bit. >> It's up from$1 $100 or so. Good. Okay. >> So, anyways. >> All right. So, uh we'll come back to some of those comments a little later on. Don't forget to keep hitting the We're only 10% of the way there, guys. So, you know, if you want this, if you want to be able to counter trade me, you're going to have to uh you're going to have to hit that like button a little bit more. >> Now, we've been talking, well, that leads us very nicely into uh DATs, digital asset treasuries. We've just been talking about the biggest one of all, strategy. Um, but you you might remember this popped off. This was this was one of the big metas of this year, one of the big stories of this year. Companies accumulating not just Bitcoin but other cryptos as well um to keep on their balance sheets and uh yeah this was this was pretty healthy for prices. >> Yeah indeed. So I mean it was at the time uh but it's basically one of those metas that came and went as quickly as the seasons, right? Mhm. >> Um, so I think firstly, let's just run back and and update people on what's been happening. And and by the way, guys, if you are not following our Telegram channel, you should be because we've we now give these regular daily alpha posts and in this particular one over I think it was last week Friday, we shared a complete breakdown exactly what's happening with the DAT meta and what impact it could have on the markets and all these DATs share prices. But we'll give you a bit of a TL. So you can scan the QR code there by the way if you want to sign up. >> But um we'll we'll break it down right now quickly for you guys. >> Okay. So let's start off. First of all, the the cumulative market cap of DATs um fell nearly 40% in just 3 months from around $175 billion uh to $15 billion by early December. >> Yeah. And a large component of this was of course strategy. It represents 50% of the total DAT market cap. So its stock heavily influences the entire sector. >> Yeah. So uh you talk about uh we talk about Bitcoin dominance, you can also talk about strategy dominance as well. >> Now this uh this seems it seems like a few key uh structural risks are now starting to emerge with DATs. Some are now trading below the value of the crypto assets that they hold. And this is obviously a sign of kind of weak investor confidence. People aren't uh aren't so keen to hold those shares. >> Yeah, exactly. And these lower valuations make it harder to raise new capital in a bare market of course. >> Yeah."

And all these debts that are taken on a lot of leverage um and don't have any external revenue um they face risks with trying to refinance and also just general solveny as well because not all of these companies actually have a working or particularly profitable business attached to them. Obviously strategy uh and this is very important to note and we'll get into this later. Strategy obviously has its software business um which is you know not not hasn't really set the world on fire but nevertheless has you know has generated revenue for the company for for many many years now but a lot of these DATs really are just holding vehicles for for crypto. >> I mean Strategy is just a Bitcoin hedge fund with the with the software business tacked on. Let's be honest. >> I'm sure if Michael Sailor were here now, Nick, he would be tearing you a new one. >> He would agree with me to be honest. Let's be fair. But anyway, so this now comes to this particular point where the biggest risk that has been presented to the market right now and that's been talked about over the past two weeks is this question of the MSCI uh de-indexing or the of strategy itself and and all for that matter. >> Yeah. >> And they're basically reviewing whether firms and MSI by the way guys is an index provider and they have a lot of different indexes. So their guidance is important for all these indexes. So Msei is now reviewing whether firms that have over 50% of their uh digital asset exposure in their in their assets should stay in these benchmarks. >> Yeah. And this is an important distinction to make because uh you know MSCI is viewing DATs as more like as being more like fund fund-like entities and funds are generally excluded from MSCIS indices. >> Yeah. And if they vote to exclude it, what will happen then is all these index funds, all these funds that track the indexes like these large institutional funds will have to then automatically and programmatically sell out of these DAT shares including strategy. >> Yeah. So if strategy is removed from I can't remember which MCI index is it the MSCI world. Yeah. >> So if it is removed from that index that mean that will mean automatic selling of MSTR stock. And the big date to watch from this, we're just just over a month out from it. This is going to be the 15th of January next year when MSCI is going to make this decision about whether or not to uh exclude strategy and of course other DATs from its indices. >> Yeah. So slightly related to this is uh like we mentioned earlier, Strategy's new dividend policy. So as we mentioned, it's a 1.44 44 billion cash reserve to support dividend dividend payments on its preferred stock and interest on outstanding debt. >> Yeah. And it basically used an at the market program to sell a load of uh class A common stock in order to in order to fund it. >> Yeah. So basically diluting the common shareholders for the preferred to pay the preferred. So >> uh now the reserve currently covers 21 months worth of dividend obligations and the aim is to build it up over time uh possibly covering 24 months or more. Okay. So, um yeah, we did a video about this recently talking about the risk to strategy. Now, we published that video just before, talk about bad timing, but just before Sailor announced this $1.44 billion uh cash reserve. Um but really, you know, the concerns that we raised in that video were, you know, a lot of it was around dividend and interest payments."

Um but really, you know, the concerns that we raised in that video were, you know, a lot of it was around dividend and interest payments. Now, it seems like uh that isn't a worry for the time being. And I think really actually this business of the MSCI um uh index removal that I think is probably a more pressing concern right now. that is more pressing because uh the moment that it goes below its M its NAV in terms of the share price trading there it they can't really issue more of the MSTR common stock to go and pay for the preferred right and then you get into this unfortunate loop where the price will continue falling and the and if and also if they have to sell Bitcoin because this is the first time I think last week that Sailor has even broached the idea of selling Bitcoin. >> Yeah. and he said they would if it if the price trades significant or the value trades significantly below the net asset value uh the market the market cap. So that is a slight concern because if they if they can't sell the stock anymore to go or issue stock anymore to go and pay for the preferred and the debt then they'll have to eventually go out and sell their Bitcoin at some point and that could be have negative implications for Bitcoin which is crazy. >> I'm not sure how much of a how much of an effect the selling would have on the charts. I mean because you imagine that they wouldn't just cheat the whole lot or cheat large chunks of it at once. But really as we and again as we pointed out in that video the psychological effect of that I think would be would be pretty damaging. >> He has also entertained the idea on top of that uh of uh using loans. So Bitcoin backed loans uh and I think that he recently said that the main concern he had with using any sort of loans to get cash for his Bitcoin was counterparty risk. But apparently now JP Morgan is getting into the Bitcoin loan business. So, you know, he they could be a counterparty to Strategy. But it's crazy that we now reliant on JP Morgan lending cash to Strategy on its Bitcoin collateral [laughter] to save our bags. How crazy that is. >> Hi, Mr. Diamond. Please, please save us all. Please save our bags. God, that would that would that would really sting, wouldn't it? Let's hope it doesn't come to that. >> Okay. Uh before we move on though, we should make a mention. Let's hope um for one thing that Sailor and Strategy are holding their Bitcoin securely in a hardware wallet and maybe they're using a tandem, right, Nick? >> Yeah. Tandem device, your all-in-one crypto solution. No seed phrases, middlemen or compromises. >> And they've actually got a sale going on right now. It's the last day of, get this guys, green Monday. So last week was black, what was it? Black, what do they call it? Like Cyber Monday or >> Black It was Black Friday. >> Black Friday. Then there was Cyber Monday. >> Oh, Cyber Monday. Yeah. >> And then now there's green Monday.

Um we now need to talk about the one factor. Nick and I were discussing this last week. We think this is probably the biggest factor that is going to decide the direction of the crypto market as we go as we end 2025 and go into 2026. So Nick, what exactly what exactly is this one factor, this magical factor? >> This one factor, it's the one chart people have been spamming on crypto Twitter for months. >> Global liquidity. >> There it is. There it is. No one can really fully define it or explain it, but it's just this magical force that should drive our bags higher. Uh so this is a chart actually. It's quite interesting because pre previously it had been Bitcoin had been tracking global liquidity quite well. >> Uh but something seems to have happened out there in earlier the year. >> The lines [clears throat] aren't going in the right direction. >> Bitcoin's basically like he's lost its way. It's it's lost in the woods. Uh while global liquidity keeps on increasing. Uh so now there many people have wondered why is this the case? Uh and there was this report that was released. There's a few factors and there was this report that was released by Arc Invest about a week or two ago and it explains some of that away. For one, uh US liquidity bottomed at 5.56 trillion on October 30 uh 30th after a $621 billion drain from the US government shutdown. So the US government shutdown meant that on the fiscal side there could not be any government spending. >> Yeah. But uh since that shutdown lifted, $70 billion has already flowed back and there's another $300 billion expected within the next 5 to6 weeks as the as the Treasury General account as that kind of normalizes and gets back to gets back to par so to speak. >> Exactly. The TGA level is still quite elevated at $892 billion versus your typical say $600 billion. >> Yeah. Meanwhile, of course, as we discussed earlier, the Fed is, it seems, turning more doubbish. Um, multiple officials are signaling support for rate cuts, and we almost certainly are going to get a rate cut on weddednesday. >> Yeah. And and macro data, as we mentioned, employment, it is weakening. Unemployment is at 4.4%. There's job losses, there's soft retail sales, and there's cooling wholesale inflation, as well as terrible consumer sentiment numbers. >> Yeah. And of course on the 1st of December, just over a week ago, quantitative tightening QT finally came to an end. >> Yeah. And I think the most important thing to point out here, guys, is that and especially as it relates to that chart is asset prices don't tend to react just to the absolute number. It's the changes in that liquidity. So these changes around the margin to the Treasury General account to uh other conditions, quantitative tightening, etc. that is what's going to have the most impact on these asset prices. >> Yeah. So, we're basically waiting for that liquidity to uh you know to begin flowing into into assets. I now let's be let's be clear. It's it's going to flow into all assets. It's not just going to flow into crypto. But you would imagine um that Bitcoin and crypto will will attract some of that liquidity at least. >> Yeah, exactly."

It's not just going to flow into crypto. But you would imagine um that Bitcoin and crypto will will attract some of that liquidity at least. >> Yeah, exactly. And um Black Rockck also released this report about in October and it's basically quote seed in balance seat balance sheet control and it talked more about uh how this this concept of fiscal dominance where the where the actions of uh the treasury itself on the fisc fisc fiscal side had been driving monetary policy decisions and it showed how the recent re rebuild of the TGA triggered a steep drop in US banking system reserves and tightening liquidity even while QT effects were already ongoing. >> Yeah. Um and of course this is all part of the bigger liquidity picture, right? Um which is as we said QT ending in the US, the TGA is being drained. Um we've also got repo stress, but China's a factor here as well, right? >> Yeah. So China is being easing. They've got credit growth and they've got the stable currency. So the result is this global liquidity becomes more un it becomes more um uneven and in uniformly tight. But that's what happened with the on the US side. Now they're both having this easy monetary policy which is leading to increased liquidity. Um so that's generally bullish for all risk assets risk on assets. This flood of liquidity this if you think about like a pool it's going to flood into all parts of the of the market including uh the riskier parts of it which is the crypto tale. Uh and in terms of when it could come like I was on a fireside chat last last week with R Paul Mr. Mr. Ra Paul himself but the banana zone >> Mr. Banana Zone >> Mr. and he said look January, February next year probably although we he'd been expecting that banana zone in Q4 this flood of liquidity >> uh he said that it's been delayed because of debt the debt refinancing cycle was impacted by co etc etc so moved it out a bit more moved the target a little bit out >> it's January now >> January sir >> it's January >> January or February that's when the apparently the banana zone will come and he says altcoin season so I you know that's what he believes Okay. Well, we'll see about that. Um, I I have to say though, uh, actually I was speaking to Ben Cowan in person last week. In fact, I recorded an interview with him, which we'll be putting out soon. Um, but Ben was also pretty bullish around sort of Q1 next year. Now, he I I won't give too much away because you should watch the interview when it comes out, but basically, I think Ben reckons we could very well see a relief rally in Q1, but he then he thinks that will probably be it afterwards. And important to note that he thinks that's probably in Bitcoin, right? >> Yes. But I think, you know, he's also sort of, you know, he I think he accepts as well that some of that some of that money finding its way into Bitcoin could also find its way into alts. I would say also it gets lost on the way to >> it gets [laughter] stuck in people's uh it get basically gets hoovered up by IBIT. Um but uh yeah and now before we move on from this um factor of liquidity, it's also uh important to point out that Coinbase Institutional have been doing the uh the research on this as well. Um and they too believe um that uh this on onslaught of liquidity is going to be good for the market. >> Yeah. Well, they've got their own proprietary Coinbase indicator, the global M2 indicator, and they say um crypto could be poised for December recovery as liquidity improves and the Fed cut odds jump to 92%. So yeah, they're also quite bullish."

So yeah, they're also quite bullish. So this is all all our hopes and dreams rest on this concept of global liquidity, you know. >> Okay. So um it has become a bit of a meme in crypto over the last few years. You know, Bitcoin overlaid with the M2 money chart as Nick pointed out that you don't see that chart so much anymore now that the lines have gone in completely opposite directions. But I think that kind of does underline the fact um you know just how important liquidity is. It's kind of boring, but it's also kind of important. So we really need to watch that. Of course, there are other things to watch as well. Things like the DXY, you know, the strength of strength of the dollar. If the dollar strengthens, that's not going to be good for risk assets. Um, but yeah, liquidity first and foremost is what we need to be keeping an eye on, right, Nick? >> Yeah, we do. Um, and um, now if you guys want to trade this global liquidity uh, flood that's coming in Q1, uh, another exchange you can consider using is Bitgate, which of course brings us to back to our trading competition. So, for those who are joining now for the first time, this is a competition where we're going to be giving away a portfolio, which I think is back to $5,000. >> We're almost $5,000. So, we're almost at par. >> Yeah. So, this is a quarterly giveaway. At the end of December, we're going to be giving away this portfolio to one of our lucky viewers. And in order to sign up, you need to have a BitGet account and signed up via that QR code. You'll also get a whole bunch of other benefits like sign up bonuses and trading fee discounts. But you need to be signed up to Bitket, have a BitKit account. You have to be watching this stream and you must vote on these trades uh uh within the within the stream. So now we're going to go and decide on we're going to open a vote up for you guys to be able to allocate decide which coin we allocate to. There's four options and you'll vote on it and then slightly later in the stream we'll come back and close the vote and open a vote for the amount allocated. >> But today, what do the options go? Okay, so after full porting into Bitcoin last week, uh so um we sold out just before the stream. We're in USDT as Nick said. So the options are we can go back into Bitcoin. Um we can stay in USDT. Um we're also looking at uh Monad, a hot trending coin at the moment, and Hyperliquids Hype as well. So have a think which one of those you would like us to uh to add to the portfolio this week. Um and then we'll give you the opportunity to uh vote on the amount the the proportion of the portfolio a little later on. Um but now is a good moment to bring in uh to bring in Lewis with a bit of TA. Right. >> Let's roll. Let's roll guys. >> Okay. [music] >> He'll show the way. >> Okay. So not that much has changed from last week. Essentially last week I said that for the total market caps we were at major supports. You can see the major diagonal support line right there and I wanted to bounce off of it and for us to come above 3.01 trillion and it bounced off of it and we're above 3.01 trillion. So that's really good for the total market cap. Same thing for the total 2. We were at the 61.8 golden ratio and I wanted a bounce and look we've we're getting a bounce."

So that's really good for the total market cap. Same thing for the total 2. We were at the 61.8 golden ratio and I wanted a bounce and look we've we're getting a bounce. So hopefully the bounce continues and things keep on going up. Uh total three, same exact thing. big diagonal support line and uh we are above it still which is really good because I don't want us to go below there that's for sure but so far for the total market caps it looks pretty good now as far as Bitcoin goes I am still planning on selling on bounces up not just for Bitcoin but for everything and like I talked about last time there is the market cycle chart and I wrote all of these things out for you from the cycle bottom to the top from the having to the top from the top to the top and from the bottom of the cycle to the the next bottom of the cycle. And if you look at all of them, they're all very, very close. These are the amount of days if 126K was the top. And so for me, the number of days are very, very close. And because of that, I'm still going to assume that the top is in. And I'm going to be wanting to get out on pumps up. For Bitcoin itself, this is what I'm looking at. I'm thinking 97,000 is a pretty good area. If you want to be very safe, as safe as possible, if you want to be as riskaverse as possible, then probably just taking some profits at 97K is a good bet. Of course, not financial advice. However, with saying that, I think it could still go all the way up to $107,000 for Bitcoin. Just personally, I'm going to be taking my profits a little bit earlier than that because I want to lock in some gains. And of course, if it does end up going even higher, well, then I'm going to have to redo my whole analysis and maybe I was wrong. In the meantime though, I will continue to look for trade setups on alts, whether that's long or short, because opportunities still come around. Just how like last time I talked about S&P6900, you know, it hit the liquidity zone, it hit this huge huge huge support area and then it bounced up. There's I'm sure there's other coins that are doing this. With saying that though, if you're not an active trader, I probably wouldn't be doing this. I would probably just be stacking Bitcoin, especially after what Larry Fink said about how sovereign wealth funds are stacking SAS and they're just buying Bitcoin at 110, 100, 90, $80,000. They just keep on stacking SATs. That's what most people should do instead of trying to trade if they aren't actually traders. And so at this point, the coins that I wanted to get into, I'm already in and a lot of them are already up. So, I think that it is not the best place to be buying anything right now. Even though things might still go up, I probably just chill or I would just keep on stacking stats. And if something does come up next week, then I'll share it in the next week's video. But right now, you know, things like Zcash, things like SPX900, and other coins I was looking at, they're already up. So, so for now, I'm just going to chill out, let the markets do its thing. Hopefully, everything keeps on going up and we can actually make some profits. But overall, things are looking pretty good. So, with that, back to you guys. >> Okay, >> Lewis is bullish. >> Bullish. Yeah, I'm 97K for the target there on Bitcoin, right? >> Okay. >> Yeah. Wow. Okay. >> Well, we shall see. I'm I'm not quite sure I [laughter] agree with that, but uh >> hey, the the Coin Bureau is a broad church, right? All opinions. All opinions welcome."

Okay, let's have a look at the top performers now from last week. Um, we're starting with one that I uh I was completely new to me. Um, and this is D0ero. So, this is a deepin protocol on Salana and it basically makes it easier for validators to process transactions faster and more efficiently. Um, now what's interesting is that uh this this project actually got a rare SEC no action letter confirming that it's 2Z coin is not a security. So that has obviously kind of uh you know that sort of news is going to be good. It's boosted institutional interest and of course uh because it's a Salana ecosystem coin it could be pumping um because of excitement around the Salana Breakpoint conference which I believe is happening this week. >> This week? Yeah. In Abu Dhabi. Why? Why would they get the special treatment with a no action letter? Only them, not others. >> I don't know, Nick. I don't work for the SEC. >> I'm I'm just curious [laughter] who in the SEC is insider trading. >> Call my mates at the SEC and find out >> who's insider trading is, you know, Paul Atkins basically like, \"Okay, guys, let's go and stack up some double Zos. >> I've got a I've got a massive stack of 2 Zed.\" Okay, what's next? >> Next is Pudgy Penguins. Uh, so this is on the back of a partnership with the NHL that was announced on the 3rd of December, >> plus a Care Bears limited edition collectible announced today. I'm I'm sure that's the main reason. >> That's the news you've been waiting for. You are a big Care Bears fan. >> I've really I can't imagine what the Pingu Care Bear will look like. Do we have an >> I imagine it would look absolutely joyous. That's That's great news. >> A Penguin Pep Care Bear. >> Don't Don't Don't act like you don't know what's going on. I' I bet you've I bet you've already got loads of them >> stacked up, man. White's fist. [laughter] >> Okay. Uh, next up is Sooie. Um, the Grayscale Sooie Trust launched on the NASDAQ on the 5th of December and Vanguard. Yeah, Vanguard also added Suie to the Bitwise 10 crypto index on the 3rd of December. So, some good news for Sui there. >> K. You know, there's going to be going to be people in the comments basically like, \"It's not Suie, it's Sui Sui, Sui, whatever you want to call it. Ave. Next coin on the list, the TVL almost doubled at $30 billion and buybacks have actually removed 94,000 ave since May. And there's also excitement around the V4 upgrade which is currently in test net. >> Okay. And uh last but not least, we also have chain links link um Gayscale again the Grayscale Chain Link Trust converted to the first US spot link ETF. The t ticker is glunk. Uh, easy to remember that, isn't it? Glink. Um, that was on the 3rd of December um on the uh NYC Arca um and it saw decent inflows around 37 million to $48 million of inflows on just the first day. So, good news for Glink. >> Can you imag Can you imagine those institutional allocators calling their brokers, can you please fill me in an allocation of glink? Glink. What's that? Glink. Glink. I want glink. >> Okay, that's fun to say, isn't it? It's been it's been a high point of the stream for me. All right, it is time to close the poll on what coin we are going to buy for the portfolio this week. So, that poll is now >> What is it? What is the winner? >> We're going to buy BTC again. >> Okay. >> Okay."

Are you Are you going to vote for another full port like you did last week? you maniacs or maybe a 75% allocation, 50 a 50% allocation or a 25% allocation. Let us know and we will execute that trade uh shortly. Um but now it is time to take a look at some of the tweets of the week. >> Okay. So this is Byzantine general and um >> for context this was a presentation that when this is the presentation Seda was giving last week introducing uh the dividend reserve and to describe this capital their capital structure strategy they used this in this chart it's like a rocket design with >> with Bitcoin there powering the engines and all of their different capital uh all of their different share classes as the the tip of of the rocket. And there were quite a few hilarious responses to this. Firstly, the char the tweet says, you know, dog, look at my the [laughter] Yeah, basically this is my quant dog, I'm so screwed. So, yeah, this is um and that's quite apt because it wasn't um who's this actor? Um >> Steve Carell. >> Steve Carl, wasn't he in the Big Short? >> Yes, he was. Yeah. >> And this is my quant that saying comes from the Big Short. And there was also another tweet there or something else. Um and it said it, you know, someone point out just go back to the original tweet, guys. Someone's got to point out the fact that if you have a more powerful rocket at the top, what do you think that's going to do to the trae trajectory of the rocket itself? >> Yes. [laughter] I mean, I'm as bad as physics and as I am at maths, but I think I I think I get the uh get the uh direction of travel. Okay, surely nothing to worry about at all. Let's move on. Next treat comes from uh Trader Main. Um yeah, he's kind of saying what I think a lot of people are thinking. I'm willing to pay for this guy to stop talking. Um, and this is in reference to Tom Lee and those uh those frankly rather unrealistic targets. I think >> in this one he did say that the crypto market has bottom. So he hasn't been disproved yet. No. So let's see. He's not wrong yet. >> He's not wrong yet. >> All right. Uh, next one comes from uh, Crypto Plots. >> Oh, this is hilarious. >> Okay. One of these little uh, one of these little follow diagrams. What's What's Doug Funny up here? >> We can go through it. Um, are you basically a flow diagram to find out if you how long you've been in a bare market for? Uh, so are you mo holding mostly Bitcoin? Yes or no? Yes, we're not in a bare market yet. So, he thinks we're not in a bare market. >> If you aren't holding Bitcoin, uh, then the question is, did you participate in the AI, you know, the AI coin, AI altcoin meta back in the winter, last winter? If you did, then your your bare market started in January 2025. >> I'm I'm beginning to see a pattern emerging here. If you didn't, well, the question is, did you participate in the memes season back in late 23 and early 24? >> If you did, then yes, your bare market has started in April."

We will revisit this next week. So, that's coming on the uh that's coming on the 12th. >> Crypto Twitter is so jaded. So, >> I know this the cynicism is just is just really uh really palpable. Okay, we've got a couple of uh dates for the diary and coins to watch this week. First up is Betensor and Tao. On the 13th of December is the long awaited Betensor hinging. >> We are getting there, folks. >> Yeah. >> Um so it' be very interesting to see uh what this does for Tao. Um whether it'll have the same effect as uh those early Bitcoin hings used to have on BTC. >> Um and what's the other coin we're watching this week? >> Solana. So Breakpoint conference in Abu Dhabi. Uh and yeah, there'll be a lot of announcements from there. So this gen generally tends to be positive for uh you know crypto prices although not so much on the bitcoin side you know that every single time there's been a bitcoin conference is one also happen in bitcoin mina yeah >> price has fallen >> okay >> so let's see but I mean this starts on the 11th of December and uh you get the feeling that it's probably going to be informed by what happens the day before on the 10th of December because as we've mentioned that is of course the FOMC meeting um and uh yeah as we said I mean yeah we're going to get that rate cut by the look of it. But the key is the summary of economic projections and how the governor's vote. What sort of what are the levels of disscent? What sort of mood is Powell in when he shuffles onto the platform? Um and then on Thursday, what's happening on Thursday? Do you remember? Do you remember him? >> Oh my word. Yes. >> He is being sentenced. >> Okay. >> And that's an important day to watch because it could have an impact on on Luna and Luke the the Luna Classic because those were pumping last week because of >> Yes. So they pump in because he's going to be sentenced. >> Okay. >> I don't understand the logic there. I mean crypto nothing makes sense anymore. But same thing why you know FTT will pump when SBF tweets in from prison. So apparently um that's a date to watch because if he is sentenced maybe the the length of the sentencing will determine how much it pumps by. >> Yeah."

Okay, in that case, I need to uh I need to share my screen so we can uh make this trade.
