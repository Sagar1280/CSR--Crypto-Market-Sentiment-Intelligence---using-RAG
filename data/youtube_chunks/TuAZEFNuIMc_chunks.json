      "text": "And we're finally back, back to live streaming. I'm so happy to be here because the trenches are   heating up. So, after this Christmas break, \nthere's not a better time to go back live,   to go back in action, and we've been printing \nso much, but I think that the Memecoin season is   only getting started. So today we're going to talk \nabout everything that I'm accumulating right now,   everything that is just popping on-chain \nrelated to Memecoins. But not only that,   in fact, I also have something in the \nprivacy meta that I would consider   as alpha that I'm bringing you guys \ntoday. And also look at the scenery. And I'm here making money, locked in as always. And I'm going to share some of the wins that we've   been having in my private group. If you're not \nthere, you should be because things are really   getting hot. Obviously, if I open DexScreener \nright now, just look at White Whale. Everything   is surrounding this, right? Just look at the White \nWhale chart. You guys remember the last time that   you saw a runner like this, an actual PvE, player \nversus environment, in which everybody just starts   making money and there's not like an endless \nPvP action. I can't remember honestly the last   time that I saw something like this. And yeah, I \ndon't know if it's going to go higher. Obviously,   it's just full retardation. If you want to buy \nthis at this very level, 185 million, it almost   touched 200. I would never buy this right now. However, I do want to say that you should probably   look into the beta plays because the beta plays \nhave been exploding as of recently. In fact, in   Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, the background. I was checking \nthat the audio is good because I also have a new   microphone. Blue Whale, you guys remember Blue \nWhale? I was shilling this, went 90X. So even if   you miss the main runners, there is still a very \ngood opportunity to just accumulate beta plays. For instance, Blue Whale was just like, \"Oh, \nthe strongest whale of them all,\" blah blah. It had good tech. So this was sending. A lot of \nother beta plays were sending. So in my opinion,   the narrative is there to stay. It's not going \nto disappear tomorrow. However, I would just not   focus on the main alpha play because if you think \nabout the risk-to-reward ratio, what do you think? That White Whale is going to go to 1 billion? I \nmean, it could by any means, but it's very high   risk and you're not going to make the most bang \nout of your buck. By the way, I want to bring some   alpha because I want to start this live stream \nwith alpha. I have something that is very early   and while you might not be early to something like \nWhite Whale, you might be early to something else. So this is something that I've been accumulating. I'm going to show you right now. It's called Pax. So I bought this yesterday. Full disclosure, I \nbrought this to my VIP group at 200k. I think   it's still incredibly cheap. So I bought it \naround this level, right? And what is Pax? So,   everybody's familiar with Pudgy Penguins, right? I \nmean, it went to billions, one of the most famous   NFT collections of all time. And behind this \nwhole narrative, there's two penguins. There's   a male and a female. The male is called Pax. And \nthe female is Polly. Polly is also sending. I'm   sidelined on this to be honest. Let's see. So, \n600k market cap. This is actually dumping right   now. It went to something like 2 million. And \nI think that this was also completely organic. I didn't see many KOLs showing this at all. But \ngiven that this went to 2 million in market cap,   look at this. This is only 570K. And this is like \nthe main character. If you think about Pudgy,   what is the brand of Pudgy representing? It's Pax. This is the main character. It's   confirmed. There's all the lore talks about \nit. This is the main freaking character. And   given it's the main character, I do believe that \nit makes sense to accumulate it. All right. And   if you want to see how early you might be \non this, 570K, it's below 1 million. There's   some KOLs activity. I'm starting to see some \npeople following it. The name is confirmed,   so it's not LARP. The team looks based. They're \nposting very, very frequently. They paid 100x Dex   booster just the other day. I like what I see. I like the engagement. Gustav was shilling it. A   lots of other people are shilling it. Win All Day."

In my opinion,   we might be on to something. Okay, we might be on \nto something. So, memes, what are we doing? We are   making money, bro. Like, you want to make money, \nbuy Memecoins. You don't want to make money,   don't buy Memecoins. I don't care what you want \nto do, bro. I buy Memecoins because I make money. In fact, clear testimony is just like my VIP \ngroup. Oh, also this, the hmm people behind   in the background are telling me that another \none of my picks is exploding right now. So,   shout out to Plex. You guys know Plex. He's right \nhere and he's telling me that Remis is sending. Well, damn. This is going strong, bro. I just posted about this on X. Did you   guys see my tweet? Okay, so I'm a mod. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Okay,   I'm going to talk about this in a second. For now, I'll just leave you with the alpha   of just looking at this tweet that I just \nposted 13 minutes ago. If you saw the tweet,   congrats because you're making money already. Damn. Separate motion. Separate motion is back. Holy cow. Remis. What entry did we get to the VIP \ngroup? 19K, 18K. Yeah, 18K. Damn. All right. Okay. More to come later. If you want to buy Memecoins \nand do basically what we're doing right now,   I'm trading Memecoins on Padre. I think it's one \nof the best trading bots at the moment. I'm also   using Axium, so I use pretty much both of them. Padre has an amazing offer because obviously it's   35% cash back. You can find the link down in the \ndescription of this video or also on the pinned   post in which you can see all the resources, all \nthe things that I use on a daily basis. But now,   let's go to some more alpha. I mean, I've just \nstarted this live stream and it's already packed   with alpha. So, I want to bring on the guests \nof today's show. It's the team from Shadow. I don't know how to pronounce this, but now \nthe team is gonna tell me how to pronounce   this. Let's bring Francis the dev. What's up, my \nbrother? GM, brother. Hope everything's good for   you. GM. Great. How about yourself? First of \nall, tell me how to actually pronounce this. It's Shadow. Shadow app. Shadow app. It says \nShadow. Yeah. Okay. Because I was thinking so,   I was not sure about that. Okay. So I want to \ngive you like one full minute. Let's say that you   want to pitch it to the audience here why this is \nconsidered as alpha what you've been building. You   have one minute without me interrupting you. Go. Okay. Perfect, perfect. What we have with Shadow   is it's an infra, ecosystem layer of privacy for \nSolana. We started with just trying to help out   normal users, you know, hide their trades and \ntransactions. And then as we got into that, we   realized that like agents are the main operating \nforce on the blockchain now, especially with low   volume. They're more agents than actually people \non the blockchain. And when you have an agent,   you give it specific instructions, codes, \nstrategies, obviously stuff that you'd want   to keep private because you don't want anyone \nelse getting that information. And there is no   blockchain level agent infrastructure on Solana \nor any other blockchain at the moment. And we   just saw the perfect spot to slide right in and \nit worked with the ecosystem and that's what we   have here of Shadow. Amazing. And also I've seen \nthat you recently sponsored Solana Breakpoint. I   guess that's crazy. When we're trying to be infra \necosystem, like an actual part of actual Solana   infrastructure, we have to make a IRL appearance \nat these events. Yeah."

I guess that's crazy. When we're trying to be infra ecosystem, like an actual part of actual Solana infrastructure, we have to make a IRL appearance at these events. Yeah. So it's a big part of our   marketing. Yeah, I was there as well. I wish \nI'd known you by then. I would have definitely   come to say hi. Oh, for sure, brother. Yeah, bro. Like so first of all, why did you decide to focus   on this narrative? So obviously privacy for the \nagent X42, how did this all come about? Honestly,   it became obvious as soon as we saw where \nthings were heading. We started with privacy   for people but as AI agents began acting on-chain \nmaking decisions you know moving running around   continuously. We realized that risk multiplies \nfaster and with X42 agent-based flows, they make   the blockchain a lot more active but also far more \nexposed. That's where Shadow naturally evolved and   that's where we are now. Okay. So, can you just \nexplain how do you help AI agents specifically   with this tech for people that don't understand so \nmuch about the meta? Shadow changes how execution   happens and instead of exposing intent and \nbehavior on-chain, we shield it. Agents can act,   pay, operate without broadcasting their strategies \nto the entire network. And that's the goal because   if you, I know obviously you use AI and your chat \nfor instance, it probably knows you better than   anyone else and you probably told it a bunch of \nstuff that you don't want it to reveal to anyone   else. And the same thing applies to agents that \nyou're training to do specific tasks especially   if they're business related because those agents \nwould, someone could easily track something that   could be existentially important to your business \nand then boom, they stole your whole entire   strategy, right? So all we do is we shield intent \nand execution through our infra privacy layer and   that way we're the only persons, people who can \nactually see the transaction and not the beginning   or the end has access to it but at the same time \nstill remaining compliant so that for instance   if there ever is some regulatory oversight and \nthe government does come calling, we're 100%   compliant and we will cooperate and operate \nwith them. So, yeah. And also, why don't you   talk more about on-chain privacy like now that AI \nagents can start obviously operating anonymously,   what's your take on this land and on the state of \nthe industry? Because AI agents don't make one-off   actions, they learn, repeat and evolve. Everything \nthey do is public. Their behavior gets mapped over   time. And this is the main reason why we have \nto focus on privacy because if people are going   to continuously add AI agents to their business \nmodels and they want to scale based on AI agents,   then you have to protect what you're scaling with \nand that's why it's so important because I like   people don't even, I don't think people understand \nhow many, how often they're using AI agents when   they're not even using them and the amount of \ninformation that's being tracked. And so for   instance that they're taking your information, \nthey're using it to obviously you know recommend   you stuff and for a whole bunch of other reasons \nand the a competitor to that company if it's not   secure will they instantly have your information \nand this is just huge, these are huge problems   and even in the US right like there's laws to \nprotect people's privacy but in the decentralized   ecosystem there's nothing to protect people's \nprivacy and we just want to slot right in and   hopefully fix that problem. Yeah. Because at the \nend of the day, we're just builders trying to fix   problems. Yeah. Yeah. All right. And obviously I \nsaw that you guys were meant to launch on the ETH,   but you delayed this. So can you talk more about \nTGE when, when's launch? You haven't launched,   right? Uh oh, 100% no. Right now we're just \nmaking sure everything is perfect."

So can you talk more about TGE when, when's launch? You haven't launched, right? Uh oh, 100% no. Right now we're just making sure everything is perfect. The launch   as of right now is planned for Monday, but you can \nkeep updated on the Twitter and in our Telegram   group where we continuously post updates. And the \ntech is live. So if anyone wants to go actually   use the swap tech, currently the X42 terminal, \nwe are building that out and hopefully trying   to get it released in the next week and a half, \ntwo weeks. The our darkpool's prediction market   is also will be live hopefully tomorrow, tomorrow \nor the next day. So we have basically 85% of the   ecosystem is already live for people to actually \nuse before TGE which is important to us because   the main goal here is to actually provide \nusable sustainable private infrastructure   on Solana not just some one-off appearance and \ndisappearance. Amazing. Amazing. So, yeah, I'm   looking forward to seeing announcement and TGE, \nbut yeah, I like what you're doing. Obviously,   the privacy meta is just ever growing. Obviously, \na lot of people are still talking about Zcash,   Monero, all these things. And I am a Solana guy, \nso I'm bullish on everything that is building on   Solana, especially on the privacy layer because \nI really, really believe in privacy. So, I think   that there's a lot of exciting things coming your \nway. Anything else that you want to add? Anything   else that you guys are working on and you feel \nwe haven't touched here? I think we touched on   everything that's important with the obviously \nthe swaps and transfers and trading. Yeah,   private prediction markets. We have a screener \nin the works. But the most obviously because   everyone doesn't like paying for DEX boosts. So hopefully we can we can also slot in there. But that's our goal in being a whole ecosystem \nas opposed to a one-off product. The wallet is   also live. Our quantum encrypted wallet is live \non the Chrome store now. So people can download   that and use that. It's all native. So we don't \nhave any access to any of your information,   but it is quantum encrypted. So people could use \nthat. That's live right now. And I think that's   about everything. I'm just more than excited to \nget the X42 terminal out and have people actually   see and actually fully understand when they see \nhow vulnerable their agents are and how much   information they're leaking and how much of their \nstrategy they're giving away for essentially free,   the whole market landscape for privacy will \nchange. I guarantee that people just don't   like they just can't comprehend it yet. Like, you \nknow what I mean? So, hopefully we can all see   that come to fruition soon, bro. That's amazing. I absolutely love what you're building. Honestly,   I'll say it once again. So, yeah, look forward \nto TGE. Hopefully, it's going to be Monday. I'm   going to be looking out for your announcement and \nlooking forward to see what you guys are going to   cook in terms of product token and everything. All right. Thanks so much for having me up here,   man. I really appreciate it. My pleasure, bro. My \npleasure. Speak soon. Bye-bye. All right. Thanks. All right. What do you guys think down in the \ncomments? Let me know. I think incredibly bullish. I also love the kind of marketing that they're \ndoing here. Obviously, they have a product. It's   not just a Memecoin. Obviously, we're talking \nabout Memecoins today, but I'm also bullish on   anything that is really built on Solana, the \nDegen chain, and everything that is involving   privacy. And obviously, there, you know, with \nall their building with like terminal, swaps, and   everything, very, very bullish. So, let me know \nwhat you think down in the comments. Drop a like   for all the alpha that I'm dropping right here. We have a lot and I mean a lot to go through. So,   I can't hesitate any further."

So, going back to \nthe alpha plays of the day, as I said, Remis,   I want to just talk a little bit about this. Obviously, you're already mentioned and I was   going crazy because the chart has been going nuts. Going nuts. I already made a 5x on this. If you   want to get the early entries, you know where to \nbe. My VIP group is one of the first links down   in the description. So many people have joined \nand I've started printing like crazy every single   day. I cannot name a single day in which I haven't \ncalled at least a 5x. So every day like bro like   literally with one call you make your subscription \nmoney back and then you start printing forever. I mean what's not to like? Okay so it's down in \nthe freaking description of the video. Join now,   start printing with me. As I said I'm using \nPadre, all the good stuff. First let me go to the   comments because I'm not reading enough comments \ntoday and then I'm going to talk a little bit of   the alpha of this place. So hit the like for the \nbanter family. The White Whale. The White Whale. I'm bullish on White Whale. The White Whale. I \nmean I'm not sure if you mean the OG one. I mean   the OG one is 24 mil. I remember that. I thought \nthat it would go here. It's been ranging forever. I mean it's one of the OG memes. I see it do well. So if you think White Whale is probably just like   a crappy derivative. Just focus on the big one. I mean at the end of the day it's 25 million. If   it follows what Troll did. Troll went to what like \n200 million 300 where did it go? Troll can also go   back to the highs like the highs were 260 million \nand in my opinion I mean this hasn't happened yet   but you see that it's ranging forever like if I'm \ntalking about OG plays Troll is definitely one of   them and White Whale would be something like the \nbest, the better play of the narrative. Cazablanca   what's up what's up one of the main researchers \non my private group he's also very bullish on Pax   main character from Pudgy Penguins 100 million \nhe says 100 million plus runner. I'm not sure if   it's going to get there, but even if it goes to a \nfew million, it's going to be an insane number of   multipliers, especially given the fact that I \ncalled this at 200k in market yesterday. Lee,   what's up? What's up? Waiting go. What's up, \nbro? Pax buy. You're buying. I like you, bro. SPX   believe. I believe in other stuff. I believe no \nbeef with SPX, but there's better stuff out there. What about GDK? Uh, so GDK is a good project that \nunfortunately got rinsed over by scam artists that   are now out of the picture. They're starting all \nover. I'm hearing things about a relaunch, but   I'm not sure if it's going to be the same branding \nof GDK or if they're just going to use something   else. I'm not sure on the top of my head, but \nonce I know I'm obviously going to talk about   it on my live streams, man, let's go separate. Let's make some moola. Let's go. Let's go. Smash   the like button first. You were not really the \nfirst, but what's up? What's up? Anything else,   guys? Drop me some CAs. Drop me some good CAs \nhere in the live stream. I'm going to take a look   and give an unbiased review. So, for instance, \nScourge is shilling. FCAT. Let's take a look,   Falcat. How do you even pronounce it? Bro, it's \n1K. Get out of here. How can somebody show me a   1K market cap? What's wrong with people?"

How can somebody show me a 1K market cap? What's wrong with people? Like what \nthe hell, bro? 90x. Yeah, Blue Whale was a 90x. This was not the only crazy call that I I mean, \nobviously this was a 90x from 20K to 1.8 mil. I   also called something else that went the Maduro \nmemes. Were you guys following then? 85x. So,   this is what I've been calling in the last couple \nof weeks. A 90X and an 85x and then multiple five   10xs pretty much every single day. I've called \nthat one last night. I called two 5xs yesterday. Oh man, like things are actually getting crazy. Things are actually getting crazy. I don't know   why people are so focused on Wojak memes and also \nit's not really meta right now. Focus on what's   meta. Focus on like whale derivatives or what I \nwas talking about Remis. Okay, more about Remis. So why am I bullish on this? I want first of all a \nlot of people might not even understand what this   Remis thing is about. But I tell you what, Remis, \nthis guy is basically one of the best traders that   I've seen in a while because this guy bought \n$370 of White Whale at 20k market cap. He's now   up something like $1.3 million. So, somebody \ndecided to create a Memecoin for this guy. Decided to send him supply and even try to \ninteract with him. But obviously like the original   meme went to zero. Then a bunch of guys started \ngetting supply and shilled guys that I that are   also close to me that also respect. Shout out to \nLim Fork. Shout out to all the guys from Tios,   my FNF, the best chats around and I tweeted about \nthis. I mean this is interesting. I mean, we're   everybody's talking about the creators economy, \nright? About giving back to creators. First of   the bunch was obviously Bags. And then yesterday, \nAllen resurrected from the dead and said that you   know the creator economy is still big and traders \nneed to make more money because now everything is   incentivized towards devs. But listen, there was \nalso a claim that creator rewards would be given   for pump.fun. I didn't really understand that \nmuch other than just losing a Solana trying to   front the narrative. That didn't work out \nthat well. Like I also take L's. But yeah,   I mean this guy is making a lot of money. If \nwe get if everybody watching his live streams   gets on the community of Remis and starts \nspamming this guy and tell him to interact,   I am sure that he's going to interact and \nwe're going to send this Memecoin to millions,   which will be extremely good, especially given \nthat yes, I'm already a 5x up here. But if   this guy interacts, imagine that this guy puts a \ntweet saying, \"I love what these guys are doing,   blah blah blah. This is a cool idea.\" Imagine this \ngoes to the millions and it's still cheap. I mean,   it's bullish. It's bullish. This dude on Banter. Yes, I am. What's up, bro? Ponke. Ponke is an OG   meme. Why are we bidding Are we still bidding \nOG memes? Let me know down in the comments. And people that are like, \"Oh, you can make money \nwith memes.\" I mean, check the wallets of me and   my friends. Nice call. Thank you, bro. People are \nbullish on Remis down in the comments. Any setups   here? I mean, we're talking about high-risk stuff \nand I don't really want to talk about the market,   Bitcoin. There's the other Banter guys that \nyou can listen to for those kind of stuff. But I am bullish. I do think that a leg up is \ndue. We had this CME gap to fill at around 90,   91K in market. We did it."

We might go up, we might \ngo down, but I mean overall medium-term, I'm very,   very bullish on the market. And the interest of \nMemecoins is increasing dramatically. Like if you   just go on CoinMarketCap, just go on CoinMarketCap \nright now and you're going to be able to see here   like memes. Okay, look at the trading volume \nlast 30 days. It's basically gone like 50% up. Like the interest in Memecoins is coming back up. And still even you can see like last seven days   even a lot of the OGs like Ponke for instance \nsomebody mentioned Ponke is up 77% in the last   week. Manu another one of my top calls in Discord \n140% up and some of the ones that were completely   dead are still like 30% up. Even Dogwifhat, who \ngives a dump about Dogwifhat in 2026, it's up 15%. Chill Guy. Who cares? Like even Melania is up. The worst Memecoin of all time is up 11% in the   last week and you're afraid in the Memecoin \nmarket. Like, thank you so much, guys. Drop a   like. Really helps me out tremendously. More love \nto the Banter family. The new alpha shitcoin. Bro,   I've seen at least like 30,000 deploy with \nthe ticker USD1. If I can give some advice,   no financial advice obviously like everything that \nI'm saying here. But I can say that USD1 pairs are   extremely risky. I don't even like to trade USD1 \npairs myself. The majority of them are LARPs. The majority of them go to zero within a matter \nof minutes. I would not bother with USD1 pairs. You saw Shadow Breakpoint. Yeah, I didn't see \nthem, but I was a bit in a rush. Bullish, bullish,   bullish. Sei memes, is Sei memes still around? I used to like this project a lot. Good team as   well, but I think it's dead. No, can't even find \nit. Yeah, I can't find it. I'm not sure if it's   still around, but it was a very good project. Yeah. Momo, are you guys still bullish on Momo? Bear Royale. It's not today. Thanks for the \nalpha. Appreciate you, Alex. Thank you for   tuning in. Why use Shadow? Why not to use it? I mean, can you find another privacy layer that   is actually building and has an actual product \nand it's launching soon? I mean, I can't find   much about anything else. So, I remain very, very \nbullish. So, plays that I'm looking at right now,   obviously, Remis. It's a very high-risk play. Don't expect this to just like buy it and then   forget about it for a month. That is not the kind \nof place that I'm talking about today. Obviously,   it's high risk. You need to be fully aware of the \nrisk of trading Memecoins. And by all means, as I   always say, you need to have a strategy. You need \nto take out your initial investment at like a two,   3x so that basically you are risk-free. You are \nrunning for free. The money is on the casino. You took out your initial investment and you have \nit run. And then if it rocks, you don't be like,   \"Oh, Cepryl, this thing me rocked.\" I had people \ncomplaining to me that Blue Whale sort of rugged. By the way, I'm not even the team. I know the \nguys behind it, but I'm not part of the team. But   people were like, \"Oh, Sri, you know, the people \nride Blue Whale, bro. I did a 90x up.\" If you   don't make money out of something that does a 90x \nwhen I give an alert at 20k market cap publicly   on my X profile and you don't take profits and \nit goes to $1.8 million. I honestly don't know   what to tell you."

I honestly don't know what to tell you. If you don't if you don't make \nmoney on stuff like this, leave the trenches for   good or educate yourself. Blue Whale, where is \nit now? 600k market still. Is it going to come   back up? I don't know. I have no idea. Do I care? No. I'm personally out right now. I'm personally   out. It did it thing two times. It is thing two \ntime. We ran it to 1.7 mil and it went 250 mil. So it's actually more than 100x now. I didn't \neven update the scan. Wow. So I called that 120x. Okay. Somebody needs to update my scorecards. This was a 120x. Where is Ronald Sheldon? This   is my live stream. You don't like it? Get out. I don't care. But we'll show soon how to fly. Okay, if you guys have missed it, I'll just say \nonce more. This is part of the broader Pudgy   Penguins narrative. Pax is documented to be the \nmain character of this base team. I think they're   going to send it. It's already sending from my \ncall at 200k. If you're fading it, at least have   the decency to join my free Telegram. It's linked \ndown in the description. That is completely free. If you want to get the early signals, you know \nwhere to be. It's my private group. It's also   linked down below. And given that it's the main \ncharacter, I mean, if just think about it. If   Polly started a narrative, it went to 2 million. Pax is even the main one because it's the face of   Pudgy Penguins itself. I have no doubt that it's \ngoing higher and higher. So, you guys know what   to do. Get on Padre, grab a bag if you like it. Obviously, if you like it, I'm not telling you buy   it randomly. I like it. That's why I bought it and \nI bought it and I'm making money with it. Okay,   Aster is the origin of Aster. Um, I've seen this \nkind of plays all the time. I'm not keen and also   Aster is not trending. I think that DEX trending \nthat per on DEX, sorry, they're still going to   trend for the foreseeable future, but I don't \nthink that Aster is getting the recognition like   should have right now. Like why should somebody \nbuy an ASTER derivative at 70 cents right now? I mean I don't even know if it goes back up. I \ndon't know. Okay. People are telling me to look   at Momo. I did 100x on Momo by the way. So made a \nlot of money. Bullish. Is it still around though? 5 million right now. This is where we bought it. 340K market cap. It's still fading. I don't know   what to say. Went to 43 mil. It seems like it's \nresurrecting a little bit. So the bottom was at   1.80. It went to 6 mil. Honestly, I do think \nthat this is one of the best communities out   there because the community is always loud and I \nthink it's also like quite organic. I just don't   know if I would ape now. I mean I don't think \nthat we can call it an OG Memecoin of the space,   but it's definitely been one of the biggest \nrunners of 2025. So, can it go up? Yes. Is   it risky? Yes. You're also buying a pullback \nnow. And by the way, no. I'm not paid by the   Momo team or anything. It's just like my biased \nopinion. I do believe that looking at the chart,   it seems like it's signifying like it's signaling \na revival. Went down from 65 to 48. Yeah,   could be something, but it obviously comes with a \nrisk. What has been your best X return so far? Um,   that's a very good question. I think that my best \ncall was USDU."

I should \nbe able to find it. Let me see. Let me see. Yeah, this one. This has probably been my best X \nreturns. So, I called it at 250K and went to 70   mil. Yeah, that was a 283x. Momo 120. I think \nthat I called at least 10 100xes in the last   year. And Blue Whale is the first 100x of this \nyear. So, congrats to my community. Round of   applause. Oh my god. Can't believe it. But anyway, \nI don't care. Like I mean, previous calls only get   you so far. Like the thing that matters to me is \nlike what's my next call going to be? You know,   you're always going to be defined by your latest \ncall, your next call. So yeah, we made a lot of   money. Multiple people have made six figures \nplus in my community. Let's just look at what's   forward. There's a lot of things to come. Thank \nyou, bro. I appreciate it. Pepe. Pepe at this   point is just like, you know, it's one of the OG \nmemes. Doge, Pepe. I think the Pepe is going to   give you a few X's if we have this Memecoin super \ncycle that a lot of people are expecting to occur. I'm bullish on Pepe. I think it's something that \nyou can size like big, but at the end of the day,   it's not going to give you like a 20x, 30x, but \nit's all about perspective. If you have like a lot   of money, I mean, feel free. I don't see anything \nwrong with it. I'm personally trading more of like   lower and midcaps. I'm not focused on high caps, \nat least when it comes to the Memecoin space. And   then if we're talking about like high high caps, \nI have a lot of like SUI, Solana obviously. But   yeah, what's your process for finding these \nrunners early? I have several guides on my   personal YouTube channel. If you're not following \nmy personal YouTube channel, obviously I do live   streams here on Crypto Banter, but I also have \nmy own YouTube channel. I'm returning on it on   Monday, so expect a new video on Monday. And I'm \nactually filming a video explaining my current   research process because I made a lot of videos in \nthe past about it, but it's ever changing. So, I   think it's mostly about identifying a meta, having \nthe good setup. If you don't have the good setup,   obviously you're not going to be in a position of \nfinding the runners in the first place. So get on   Axium, get on Padre, put the filters that work for \nyou. Eliminate all the noise. So for instance, you   remove all the rugs, the things that have migrated \nand have gone like sub 20k markup or something   like that. You basically just identify all the \nfilters that you need. And once you're in it, you   basically have the right canvas to just like focus \non what you're going to find. And then just go on   Crypto Twitter, see what everybody is talking \nabout. Identify the right meta. Don't bid on   something that is completely dead. And obviously, \nit all depends like am I there's different type of   trenching. There's people that focus on something \nlike new pairs. If you focus on new pairs, you're   going to have a completely different strategy \nof finding sort of blue chips are already in the   10 million plus in terms of market cap. So, I'm \ngoing to talk about it all in new videos, but I   have already like plenty of guts. So, I could just \nlike talk about this, but I would have to make it   like a three-hour live stream because there's just \ntoo much to digress. And also everybody's going   to have a different strategy."

I have a strategy. Some other people that I trade with have different   strategies from me. They both work. Just find what \nworks for you. Because if you have if you make a   lot of money with new pairs, I'm not going to tell \nyou to buy midcaps. If you make a lot of money   with midcaps, I'm not going to tell you to focus \non new pairs. There's always a different strategy   and different ways to make money. But if you just \nlock in, I know it sounds cliche, but if you lock   in, if you find what works for you, you're just \nnever going to go look back and you're going   to make a lot of money. I know it sounds cliche, \nbut it's really not. Okay. There's a lot of other   things that I want to talk about today. I also \nwant to remind you guys if you want to do futures,   I have an insane offer. I was looking to start \ntoday, but I'm actually going to start from   next week because I had just some technical \nproblems in the back end. But from next week,   I'm basically going to give away $2,000 every \nlive stream as a trading bonus on Blofin. Blofin,   I don't just do Memecoins. I also do futures \nperpetuals. And on Blofin, this is a platform   that I'm using basically on every live stream. I'm going to select four people. So, I'm going   to see I'm going to have the dashboard of Blofin. I'm going to see who registers with my link and   how much money you deposit. So, all you got to do \nis deposit at least $1,000. You deposit $1,000,   you start trading. And if I see that you deposit \nthat amount of money and you started to use the   platform, I'm going to select every week four \ndifferent people, four different UIDs and I'm   going to give you $500 that you can use to as a \ntrading bonus to offset your trading fees. You're   welcome. All you got to do is register with the \nlink that is down below and join my next live   streams here on Crypto Banter. Drop your UID \nand I'm going to check it. If you're eligible,   I'm going to give you some money. That's it. No \nstrings attached. All the terms and conditions by   the way are on the landing page. Feel free to \ncheck them out. Now I also want to talk about   another project that should be alpha. Um so as \na lot of you know I'm also starting to dive into   the field of prediction market. Although I'm not \nnecessarily a specialist of prediction market,   but it's definitely something that is more and \nmore interesting that I'm getting more and more   interested in especially because I saw some of my \nfriends like make a lot of money with like some   Maduro the Venezuelan president oriented stuff and \nI saw this project and they actually reached out   to me. Is another sponsor of today's video by the \nway, full disclosure that is basically mastering   sports betting or sports prediction market as we \ncan call it right here with AI. So, it's basically   going to be a coin that's going to launch and \nthe utility of this is going to be to give you   the best odds available in the market to bet \non prediction markets that are sports oriented. I hope that I'm explaining this correctly, but \nthe way that it works is that you can join the   pre-sale and it's actually live for one day only. I'm going to try to drop a link down description   or something like that. And you can buy this \non PinkSale. I'm also going to put a post on   Telegram, so feel free to check it out from there."

I'm going to try to drop a link down description or something like that. And you can buy this on PinkSale. I'm also going to put a post on Telegram, so feel free to check it out from there. And all you can do is basically you connect your   MetaMask wallet, you buy a bag on pre-sale and as \nsoon as the project gets launched and goes live,   you're able to claim those tokens immediately \nto your MetaMask or Coinbase wallet, whatever,   but anything that is that supports Ethereum. So \nthis is not Phantom wallet, this is not Solana,   but you buy a bag on pre-sale, the project \nlaunches, it launches in a couple of days. You   claim the tokens and then you can sell them. In my \nexperience, I cannot guarantee returns. Obviously,   do your own research. It's still risky. It still \ncan be less than the money you put. Obviously,   do your own research. But in my experience, \nthe only pre-sales that I've done on Pixel or   this kind of platform have given me at least a \n3x at launch. Obviously, previous performances   don't guarantee future results. But I'm trusting \nmy gut here. So, I do believe that it's going to   send. I'm going to give an update next week \nobviously and see how the investment is going   to how the trade is going to do. But if you can \nsee just like the utility and how this has like   impacted the field of like sports prediction 60% \nof win rate and an average of an increased average   ROI on you know performance without this AI tool \nof 25 23% up in my opinion that's interesting on   18,000 kind of like trades bets however you want \nto call it they also have details about the tech   which I'm not going to bore you with, but the \nwebsite itself is Pikc. So, pikc.ai. Feel free   to check it out. I'm also going to post on my \nTelegram the link to participate in the pre-sale. So, check it out. Also, I want to mention that \nthe team is fully doxed. So, if something like   this was not doxed, I would probably not bother \ninvesting in it. But given that it's fully doxed   and you can research all these guys, they have \nLinkedIn profile and everything. It gives a   little more trust and a little more authority. So, \nwe're going to see about that. We're going to see   about that. You can also feel free to see here the \ntokenomics blah blah blah. Everything is explained   right there. Okay, more shills. Male. Okay, let's \ntake a look. Let me close a few tabs because my   laptop is exploding. M Whale. I guess it's another \nderivative of the White Whale. The mama whale. Oh,   I think that Blay showed me this the other day. Bro, I would not be the short. So, if it loses   the support line here. So, right now it's trading \nat this horizontal support. If it loses it, it's   dead. Probably dies. Probably does something like \nthis, bro. Zero. Zcash. Uh, I don't like Zcash,   bro. I think that Zcash is not even a real privacy \ncoin. So first of all, if a coin gives you the   option of privacy, it's not a privacy coin. Like \nprivacy should be by default. This is why Monero   is a privacy coin and Zcash is not. Zcash is like \na Bitcoin replica with privacy option. The core   team left. Why would you buy it? Obviously, after \nwe have a crash of 30% in one day, it's going to   come back a little bit. Sure, because there's \nalways a dead cat bounce. But I do believe that   it's like bum then a bounce zero. So I think that \nmy target for Zach is something like $200. Um if   you are able to get a good entry would probably \nbe a good short but yeah whatever. Easy looking   to pop. Why? Why? I don't get it. Let's lock in \nsmart guy. Okay the the last sponsor that I want   to talk about today is Riv. You guys remember \nRivcoin?"

Okay the the last sponsor that I want to talk about today is Riv. You guys remember Rivcoin? It's a project that is launching soon. Let's see how much Plex can say. Plex is part of \nthe team of Riv obviously and Plex is my closest   collaborator. He's the PR guy in my Discord. Everybody knows him. Everybody loves him. So,   I'm going to give the word to Plex for a little \nright. Still hear me? Whoops. And the magnet fell   off. All right. What's up, bro? GM. GM. GM. You're \nhere in Colombia enjoying also Medellin. I mean,   it's amazing to be I mean, look at look at the \nbackground. Yeah. I don't think I can show it,   but we have a jacuzzi there. Can we Crazy mansion? Yeah. Do you see that? Like a freaking jacuzzi on   the balcony. Crazy dump. All right. Absolutely. The stage is yours, bro. Absolutely. Yeah. So,   I've been talking about Riv in the last three \nmonths, I think, on Crypto Banter. And um as I   said a lot of times, I've been part of the team \nfor more than two years now. And in these two   years, Riv has been building and building, not \nonly building tech, but also building um all   the compliance side of things. You know when you \nwant to have a serious project, launch a serious   project, you always have to take in accounting \nalso all the legal aspects and this is a very   important thing. All the team is doxed as you can \nsee from X you can go on the website see the CEO   see listen to what the vision is and understand \nmore and more of it. Something else that we have   been doing we have been giving away thousands and \nthousands of dollar. We'll be giving away more   than 18K in the last year or so, like nine months \nor so. And we just did like another challenge,   a new challenge about clipping this live stream. And we're going to do another one very similar. So make sure you join the community, join the \nTelegram, join the Discord. Don't miss out on   these opportunities. And as Cepryl said, Riv is \ngonna launch very soon. So the only way you have   to be early on the launch to be the first ones to \nbuy the coin is to join the communities. Join the   communities. Visit the website. There's also a \nwhitelist you can apply in to get a potential   airdrop. So join the whitelist the communities. It's free money. And don't miss out. I mean if   you want to be early on this that's the way you \nhave to do it. So, make sure to follow Riv, join   the communities, and we're also running monthly \ngiveaways of $1,000 split between five people. So,   that's $200 each. And literally, the only thing \nyou have to do is join the community, follow on X,   and make yourself notice, be active in the \ncommunity, comment under the posts, and you're   going to have a chance to win $200.

I mean check it out. Appreciate you. Thank you   for being here. What's the alpha? What are we \nbuying on Memecoins on a less serious note? Well, I don't know if you can hear Plex, but \nRemis is just Yeah, we have a note that Remis   is sending back. Guess somebody likes it. I \ndo. What are these buys? What are those? Okay,   I'll leave it to that."
