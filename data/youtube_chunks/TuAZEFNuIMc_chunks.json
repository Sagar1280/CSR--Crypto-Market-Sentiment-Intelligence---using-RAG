      "text": "And we're finally back, back to live streaming. I'm so happy to be here because the trenches are heating up. So, after this Christmas break, there's not a better time to go back live, to go back in action, and we've been printing so much, but I think that the Memecoin season is only getting started. So today we're going to talk about everything that I'm accumulating right now, everything that is just popping on-chain related to Memecoins. But not only that, in fact, I also have something in the privacy meta that I would consider as alpha that I'm bringing you guys today. And also look at the scenery. And I'm here making money, locked in as always. And I'm going to share some of the wins that we've been having in my private group. If you're not there, you should be because things are really getting hot. Obviously, if I open DexScreener right now, just look at White Whale. Everything is surrounding this, right? Just look at the White Whale chart. You guys remember the last time that you saw a runner like this, an actual PvE, player versus environment, in which everybody just starts making money and there's not like an endless PvP action. I can't remember honestly the last time that I saw something like this. And yeah, I don't know if it's going to go higher. Obviously, it's just full retardation. If you want to buy this at this very level, 185 million, it almost touched 200. I would never buy this right now. However, I do want to say that you should probably look into the beta plays because the beta plays have been exploding as of recently. In fact, in Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, the background. I was checking that the audio is good because I also have a new microphone. Blue Whale, you guys remember Blue Whale? I was shilling this, went 90X. So even if you miss the main runners, there is still a very good opportunity to just accumulate beta plays. For instance, Blue Whale was just like, \"Oh, the strongest whale of them all,\" blah blah. It had good tech. So this was sending. A lot of other beta plays were sending. So in my opinion, the narrative is there to stay. It's not going to disappear tomorrow. However, I would just not focus on the main alpha play because if you think about the risk-to-reward ratio, what do you think? That White Whale is going to go to 1 billion? I mean, it could by any means, but it's very high risk and you're not going to make the most bang out of your buck. By the way, I want to bring some alpha because I want to start this live stream with alpha. I have something that is very early and while you might not be early to something like White Whale, you might be early to something else. So this is something that I've been accumulating. I'm"

By the way, I want to bring some alpha because I want to start this live stream with alpha. I have something that is very early and while you might not be early to something like White Whale, you might be early to something else. So this is something that I've been accumulating. I'm going to show you right now. It's called Pax. So I bought this yesterday. Full disclosure, I brought this to my VIP group at 200k. I think it's still incredibly cheap. So I bought it around this level, right? And what is Pax? So, everybody's familiar with Pudgy Penguins, right? I mean, it went to billions, one of the most famous NFT collections of all time. And behind this whole narrative, there's two penguins. There's a male and a female. The male is called Pax. And the female is Polly. Polly is also sending. I'm sidelined on this to be honest. Let's see. So, 600k market cap. This is actually dumping right now. It went to something like 2 million. And I think that this was also completely organic. I didn't see many KOLs showing this at all. But given that this went to 2 million in market cap, look at this. This is only 570K. And this is like the main character. If you think about Pudgy, what is the brand of Pudgy representing? It's Pax. This is the main character. It's confirmed. There's all the lore talks about it. This is the main freaking character. And given it's the main character, I do believe that it makes sense to accumulate it. All right. And if you want to see how early you might be on this, 570K, it's below 1 million. There's some KOLs activity. I'm starting to see some people following it. The name is confirmed, so it's not LARP. The team looks based. They're posting very, very frequently. They paid 100x Dex booster just the other day. I like what I see. I like the engagement. Gustav was shilling it. A lots of other people are shilling it. Win All Day. Shout out to Win All Day, guys. In my opinion, we might be on to something. Okay, we might be on to something. So, memes, what are we doing? We are making money, bro. Like, you want to make money, buy Memecoins. You don't want to make money, don't buy Memecoins. I don't care what you want to do, bro. I buy Memecoins because I make money. In fact, clear testimony is just like my VIP group. Oh, also this, the hmm people behind in the background are telling me that another one of my picks is exploding right now. So, shout out to Plex."

You guys know Plex. He's right here and he's telling me that Remis is sending. Well, damn. This is going strong, bro. I just posted about this on X. Did you guys see my tweet? Okay, so I'm a mod. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Okay, I'm going to talk about this in a second. For now, I'll just leave you with the alpha of just looking at this tweet that I just posted 13 minutes ago. If you saw the tweet, congrats because you're making money already. Damn. Separate motion. Separate motion is back. Holy cow. Remis. What entry did we get to the VIP group? 19K, 18K. Yeah, 18K. Damn. All right. Okay. More to come later. If you want to buy Memecoins and do basically what we're doing right now, I'm trading Memecoins on Padre. I think it's one of the best trading bots at the moment. I'm also using Axium, so I use pretty much both of them. Padre has an amazing offer because obviously it's 35% cash back. You can find the link down in the description of this video or also on the pinned post in which you can see all the resources, all the things that I use on a daily basis. But now, let's go to some more alpha. I mean, I've just started this live stream and it's already packed with alpha. So, I want to bring on the guests of today's show. It's the team from Shadow. I don't know how to pronounce this, but now the team is gonna tell me how to pronounce this. Let's bring Francis the dev. What's up, my brother? GM, brother. Hope everything's good for you. GM. Great. How about yourself? First of all, tell me how to actually pronounce this. It's Shadow. Shadow app. Shadow app. It says Shadow. Yeah. Okay. Because I was thinking so, I was not sure about that. Okay. So I want to give you like one full minute. Let's say that you want to pitch it to the audience here why this is considered as alpha what you've been building. You have one minute without me interrupting you. Go. Okay. Perfect, perfect. What we have with Shadow is it's an infra, ecosystem layer of privacy for Solana.

What we have with Shadow is it's an infra, ecosystem layer of privacy for Solana. We started with just trying to help out normal users, you know, hide their trades and transactions. And then as we got into that, we realized that like agents are the main operating force on the blockchain now, especially with low volume. They're more agents than actually people on the blockchain. And when you have an agent, you give it specific instructions, codes, strategies, obviously stuff that you'd want to keep private because you don't want anyone else getting that information. And there is no blockchain level agent infrastructure on Solana or any other blockchain at the moment. And we just saw the perfect spot to slide right in and it worked with the ecosystem and that's what we have here of Shadow. Amazing. And also I've seen that you recently sponsored Solana Breakpoint. I guess that's crazy. When we're trying to be infra ecosystem, like an actual part of actual Solana infrastructure, we have to make a IRL appearance at these events. Yeah. So it's a big part of our marketing. Yeah, I was there as well. I wish I'd known you by then. I would have definitely come to say hi. Oh, for sure, brother. Yeah, bro. Like so first of all, why did you decide to focus on this narrative? So obviously privacy for the agent X42, how did this all come about? Honestly, it became obvious as soon as we saw where things were heading. We started with privacy for people but as AI agents began acting on-chain making decisions you know moving running around continuously. We realized that risk multiplies faster and with X42 agent-based flows, they make the blockchain a lot more active but also far more exposed. That's where Shadow naturally evolved and that's where we are now. Okay. So, can you just explain how do you help AI agents specifically with this tech for people that don't understand so much about the meta? Shadow changes how execution happens and instead of exposing intent and behavior on-chain, we shield it. Agents can act, pay, operate without broadcasting their strategies to the entire network. And that's the goal because if you, I know obviously you use AI and your chat for instance, it probably knows you better than anyone else and you probably told it a bunch of stuff that you don't want it to reveal to anyone else. And the same thing applies to agents that you're training to do specific tasks especially if they're business related because those agents would, someone could easily"

And the same thing applies to agents that you're training to do specific tasks especially if they're business related because those agents would, someone could easily track something that could be existentially important to your business and then boom, they stole your whole entire strategy, right? So all we do is we shield intent and execution through our infra privacy layer and that way we're the only persons, people who can actually see the transaction and not the beginning or the end has access to it but at the same time still remaining compliant so that for instance if there ever is some regulatory oversight and the government does come calling, we're 100% compliant and we will cooperate and operate with them. So, yeah. And also, why don't you talk more about on-chain privacy like now that AI agents can start obviously operating anonymously, what's your take on this land and on the state of the industry? Because AI agents don't make one-off actions, they learn, repeat and evolve. Everything they do is public. Their behavior gets mapped over time. And this is the main reason why we have to focus on privacy because if people are going to continuously add AI agents to their business models and they want to scale based on AI agents, then you have to protect what you're scaling with and that's why it's so important because I like people don't even, I don't think people understand how many, how often they're using AI agents when they're not even using them and the amount of information that's being tracked. And so for instance that they're taking your information, they're using it to obviously you know recommend you stuff and for a whole bunch of other reasons and the a competitor to that company if it's not secure will they instantly have your information and this is just huge, these are huge problems and even in the US right like there's laws to protect people's privacy but in the decentralized ecosystem there's nothing to protect people's privacy and we just want to slot right in and hopefully fix that problem. Yeah. Because at the end of the day, we're just builders trying to fix problems. Yeah. Yeah. All right. And obviously I saw that you guys were meant to launch on the ETH, but you delayed this. So can you talk more about TGE when, when's launch? You haven't launched, right? Uh oh, 100% no. Right now we're just making sure everything is perfect. The launch as of right now is planned"

The launch as of right now is planned for Monday, but you can keep updated on the Twitter and in our Telegram group where we continuously post updates. And the tech is live. So if anyone wants to go actually use the swap tech, currently the X42 terminal, we are building that out and hopefully trying to get it released in the next week and a half, two weeks. The our darkpool's prediction market is also will be live hopefully tomorrow, tomorrow or the next day. So we have basically 85% of the ecosystem is already live for people to actually use before TGE which is important to us because the main goal here is to actually provide usable sustainable private infrastructure on Solana not just some one-off appearance and disappearance. Amazing. Amazing. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing announcement and TGE, but yeah, I like what you're doing. Obviously, the privacy meta is just ever growing. Obviously, a lot of people are still talking about Zcash, Monero, all these things. And I am a Solana guy, so I'm bullish on everything that is building on Solana, especially on the privacy layer because I really, really believe in privacy. So, I think that there's a lot of exciting things coming your way. Anything else that you want to add? Anything else that you guys are working on and you feel we haven't touched here? I think we touched on everything that's important with the obviously the swaps and transfers and trading. Yeah, private prediction markets. We have a screener in the works. But the most obviously because everyone doesn't like paying for DEX boosts. So hopefully we can we can also slot in there. But that's our goal in being a whole ecosystem as opposed to a one-off product. The wallet is also live. Our quantum encrypted wallet is live on the Chrome store now. So people can download that and use that. It's all native. So we don't have any access to any of your information, but it is quantum encrypted. So people could use that. That's live right now. And I think that's about everything. I'm just more than excited to get the X42 terminal out and have people actually see and actually fully understand when they see how vulnerable their agents are and how much information they're leaking and how much of their strategy they're giving away for essentially free, the whole market landscape"

I guarantee that people just don't like they just can't comprehend it yet. Like, you know what I mean? So, hopefully we can all see that come to fruition soon, bro. That's amazing. I absolutely love what you're building. Honestly, I'll say it once again. So, yeah, look forward to TGE. Hopefully, it's going to be Monday. I'm going to be looking out for your announcement and looking forward to see what you guys are going to cook in terms of product token and everything. All right. Thanks so much for having me up here, man. I really appreciate it. My pleasure, bro. My pleasure. Speak soon. Bye-bye. All right. Thanks. All right. What do you guys think down in the comments? Let me know. I think incredibly bullish. I also love the kind of marketing that they're doing here. Obviously, they have a product. It's not just a Memecoin. Obviously, we're talking about Memecoins today, but I'm also bullish on anything that is really built on Solana, the Degen chain, and everything that is involving privacy. And obviously, there, you know, with all their building with like terminal, swaps, and everything, very, very bullish. So, let me know what you think down in the comments. Drop a like for all the alpha that I'm dropping right here. We have a lot and I mean a lot to go through. So, I can't hesitate any further. So, going back to the alpha plays of the day, as I said, Remis, I want to just talk a little bit about this. Obviously, you're already mentioned and I was going crazy because the chart has been going nuts. Going nuts. I already made a 5x on this. If you want to get the early entries, you know where to be. My VIP group is one of the first links down in the description. So many people have joined and I've started printing like crazy every single day. I cannot name a single day in which I haven't called at least a 5x. So every day like bro like literally with one call you make your subscription money back and then you start printing forever. I mean what's not to like? Okay so it's down in the freaking description of the video. Join now, start printing with me. As I said I'm using Padre, all the good stuff. First"

First let me go to the comments because I'm not reading enough comments today and then I'm going to talk a little bit of the alpha of this place. So hit the like for the banter family. The White Whale. The White Whale. I'm bullish on White Whale. The White Whale. I mean I'm not sure if you mean the OG one. I mean the OG one is 24 mil. I remember that. I thought that it would go here. It's been ranging forever. I mean it's one of the OG memes. I see it do well. So if you think White Whale is probably just like a crappy derivative. Just focus on the big one. I mean at the end of the day it's 25 million. If it follows what Troll did. Troll went to what like 200 million 300 where did it go? Troll can also go back to the highs like the highs were 260 million and in my opinion I mean this hasn't happened yet but you see that it's ranging forever like if I'm talking about OG plays Troll is definitely one of them and White Whale would be something like the best, the better play of the narrative. Cazablanca what's up what's up one of the main researchers on my private group he's also very bullish on Pax main character from Pudgy Penguins 100 million he says 100 million plus runner. I'm not sure if it's going to get there, but even if it goes to a few million, it's going to be an insane number of multipliers, especially given the fact that I called this at 200k in market yesterday. Lee, what's up? What's up? Waiting go. What's up, bro? Pax buy. You're buying. I like you, bro. SPX believe. I believe in other stuff. I believe no beef with SPX, but there's better stuff out there. What about GDK? Uh, so GDK is a good project that unfortunately got rinsed over by scam artists that are now out of the picture. They're starting all over. I'm hearing things about a relaunch, but I'm not sure if it's going to be the same branding of GDK or if they're just going to use something else. I'm not sure on the top of my head, but once I know I'm obviously going to talk about it on my live streams, man, let's go separate. Let's"

Smash the like button first. You were not really the first, but what's up? What's up? Anything else, guys? Drop me some CAs. Drop me some good CAs here in the live stream. I'm going to take a look and give an unbiased review. So, for instance, Scourge is shilling. FCAT. Let's take a look, Falcat. How do you even pronounce it? Bro, it's 1K. Get out of here. How can somebody show me a 1K market cap? What's wrong with people? Like what the hell, bro? 90x. Yeah, Blue Whale was a 90x. This was not the only crazy call that I I mean, obviously this was a 90x from 20K to 1.8 mil. I also called something else that went the Maduro memes. Were you guys following then? 85x. So, this is what I've been calling in the last couple of weeks. A 90X and an 85x and then multiple five 10xs pretty much every single day. I've called that one last night. I called two 5xs yesterday. Oh man, like things are actually getting crazy. Things are actually getting crazy. I don't know why people are so focused on Wojak memes and also it's not really meta right now. Focus on what's meta. Focus on like whale derivatives or what I was talking about Remis. Okay, more about Remis. So why am I bullish on this? I want first of all a lot of people might not even understand what this Remis thing is about. But I tell you what, Remis, this guy is basically one of the best traders that I've seen in a while because this guy bought $370 of White Whale at 20k market cap. He's now up something like $1.3 million. So, somebody decided to create a Memecoin for this guy. Decided to send him supply and even try to interact with him. But obviously like the original meme went to zero. Then a bunch of guys started getting supply and shilled guys that I that are also close to me that also respect. Shout out to Lim Fork. Shout out to all the guys from Tios, my FNF, the best chats around and I tweeted about this. I mean this is interesting. I mean, we're everybody's talking about the creators economy, right? About giving back to creators. First of the bunch was obviously Bags. And"

About giving back to creators. First of the bunch was obviously Bags. And then yesterday, Allen resurrected from the dead and said that you know the creator economy is still big and traders need to make more money because now everything is incentivized towards devs. But listen, there was also a claim that creator rewards would be given for pump.fun. I didn't really understand that much other than just losing a Solana trying to front the narrative. That didn't work out that well. Like I also take L's. But yeah, I mean this guy is making a lot of money. If we get if everybody watching his live streams gets on the community of Remis and starts spamming this guy and tell him to interact, I am sure that he's going to interact and we're going to send this Memecoin to millions, which will be extremely good, especially given that yes, I'm already a 5x up here. But if this guy interacts, imagine that this guy puts a tweet saying, \"I love what these guys are doing, blah blah blah. This is a cool idea.\" Imagine this goes to the millions and it's still cheap. I mean, it's bullish. It's bullish. This dude on Banter. Yes, I am. What's up, bro? Ponke. Ponke is an OG meme. Why are we bidding Are we still bidding OG memes? Let me know down in the comments. And people that are like, \"Oh, you can make money with memes.\" I mean, check the wallets of me and my friends. Nice call. Thank you, bro. People are bullish on Remis down in the comments. Any setups here? I mean, we're talking about high-risk stuff and I don't really want to talk about the market, Bitcoin. There's the other Banter guys that you can listen to for those kind of stuff. But I am bullish. I do think that a leg up is due. We had this CME gap to fill at around 90, 91K in market. We did it. We might go up, we might go down, but I mean overall medium-term, I'm very, very bullish on the market. And the interest of Memecoins is increasing dramatically. Like if you just go on CoinMarketCap, just go on CoinMarketCap right now and you're going to be able to see here like memes. Okay, look at the trading volume last 30 days. It's basically gone like 50% up. Like the interest in Memecoins is coming back up. And still"

It's basically gone like 50% up. Like the interest in Memecoins is coming back up. And still even you can see like last seven days even a lot of the OGs like Ponke for instance somebody mentioned Ponke is up 77% in the last week. Manu another one of my top calls in Discord 140% up and some of the ones that were completely dead are still like 30% up. Even Dogwifhat, who gives a dump about Dogwifhat in 2026, it's up 15%. Chill Guy. Who cares? Like even Melania is up. The worst Memecoin of all time is up 11% in the last week and you're afraid in the Memecoin market. Like, thank you so much, guys. Drop a like. Really helps me out tremendously. More love to the Banter family. The new alpha shitcoin. Bro, I've seen at least like 30,000 deploy with the ticker USD1. If I can give some advice, no financial advice obviously like everything that I'm saying here. But I can say that USD1 pairs are extremely risky. I don't even like to trade USD1 pairs myself. The majority of them are LARPs. The majority of them go to zero within a matter of minutes. I would not bother with USD1 pairs. You saw Shadow Breakpoint. Yeah, I didn't see them, but I was a bit in a rush. Bullish, bullish, bullish. Sei memes, is Sei memes still around? I used to like this project a lot. Good team as well, but I think it's dead. No, can't even find it. Yeah, I can't find it. I'm not sure if it's still around, but it was a very good project. Yeah. Momo, are you guys still bullish on Momo? Bear Royale. It's not today. Thanks for the alpha. Appreciate you, Alex. Thank you for tuning in. Why use Shadow? Why not to use it? I mean, can you find another privacy layer that is actually building and has an actual product and it's launching soon? I mean, I can't find much about anything else. So, I remain very, very bullish. So, plays that I'm looking at right now, obviously, Remis. It's a very high-risk play. Don't expect this to just like buy it and then forget about it for a month. That is not the kind of place that I'm talking about today. Obviously, it's high risk. You need to be fully aware of the risk of trading Memecoins.

That is not the kind of place that I'm talking about today. Obviously, it's high risk. You need to be fully aware of the risk of trading Memecoins. And by all means, as I always say, you need to have a strategy. You need to take out your initial investment at like a two, 3x so that basically you are risk-free. You are running for free. The money is on the casino. You took out your initial investment and you have it run. And then if it rocks, you don't be like, \"Oh, Cepryl, this thing me rocked.\" I had people complaining to me that Blue Whale sort of rugged. By the way, I'm not even the team. I know the guys behind it, but I'm not part of the team. But people were like, \"Oh, Sri, you know, the people ride Blue Whale, bro. I did a 90x up.\" If you don't make money out of something that does a 90x when I give an alert at 20k market cap publicly on my X profile and you don't take profits and it goes to $1.8 million. I honestly don't know what to tell you. If you don't if you don't make money on stuff like this, leave the trenches for good or educate yourself. Blue Whale, where is it now? 600k market still. Is it going to come back up? I don't know. I have no idea. Do I care? No. I'm personally out right now. I'm personally out. It did it thing two times. It is thing two time. We ran it to 1.7 mil and it went 250 mil. So it's actually more than 100x now. I didn't even update the scan. Wow. So I called that 120x. Okay. Somebody needs to update my scorecards. This was a 120x. Where is Ronald Sheldon? This is my live stream. You don't like it? Get out. I don't care. But we'll show soon how to fly. Okay, if you guys have missed it, I'll just say once more. This is part of the broader Pudgy Penguins narrative. Pax is documented to be the main character of this base team. I think they're going to send it. It's already sending from my call at 200k. If you're fading it, at least have the decency to join my free Telegram. It's linked down in the description. That is completely free. If you want to get the early signals, you know where to be. It's my private group. It's also linked down below. And given that it's the main character, I mean, if just think about it. If Polly started a narrative,"

If you want to get the early signals, you know where to be. It's my private group. It's also linked down below. And given that it's the main character, I mean, if just think about it. If Polly started a narrative, it went to 2 million. Pax is even the main one because it's the face of Pudgy Penguins itself. I have no doubt that it's going higher and higher. So, you guys know what to do. Get on Padre, grab a bag if you like it. Obviously, if you like it, I'm not telling you buy it randomly. I like it. That's why I bought it and I bought it and I'm making money with it. Okay, Aster is the origin of Aster. Um, I've seen this kind of plays all the time. I'm not keen and also Aster is not trending. I think that DEX trending that per on DEX, sorry, they're still going to trend for the foreseeable future, but I don't think that Aster is getting the recognition like should have right now. Like why should somebody buy an ASTER derivative at 70 cents right now? I mean I don't even know if it goes back up. I don't know. Okay. People are telling me to look at Momo. I did 100x on Momo by the way. So made a lot of money. Bullish. Is it still around though? 5 million right now. This is where we bought it. 340K market cap. It's still fading. I don't know what to say. Went to 43 mil. It seems like it's resurrecting a little bit. So the bottom was at 1.80. It went to 6 mil. Honestly, I do think that this is one of the best communities out there because the community is always loud and I think it's also like quite organic. I just don't know if I would ape now. I mean I don't think that we can call it an OG Memecoin of the space, but it's definitely been one of the biggest runners of 2025. So, can it go up? Yes. Is it risky? Yes. You're also buying a pullback now. And by the way, no. I'm not paid by the Momo team or anything. It's just like my biased opinion. I do believe that looking at the chart, it seems like it's signifying like it's signaling a revival. Went down from 65 to 48. Yeah, could be something, but it obviously comes with a risk. What has been your best X return so far? Um, that's a very good question. I think that my best call was USDU. I'm actually going to pop"

What has been your best X return so far? Um, that's a very good question. I think that my best call was USDU. I'm actually going to pop it on the screen right now if I can find it. I should be able to find it. Let me see. Let me see. Yeah, this one. This has probably been my best X returns. So, I called it at 250K and went to 70 mil. Yeah, that was a 283x. Momo 120. I think that I called at least 10 100xes in the last year. And Blue Whale is the first 100x of this year. So, congrats to my community. Round of applause. Oh my god. Can't believe it. But anyway, I don't care. Like I mean, previous calls only get you so far. Like the thing that matters to me is like what's my next call going to be? You know, you're always going to be defined by your latest call, your next call. So yeah, we made a lot of money. Multiple people have made six figures plus in my community. Let's just look at what's forward. There's a lot of things to come. Thank you, bro. I appreciate it. Pepe. Pepe at this point is just like, you know, it's one of the OG memes. Doge, Pepe. I think the Pepe is going to give you a few X's if we have this Memecoin super cycle that a lot of people are expecting to occur. I'm bullish on Pepe. I think it's something that you can size like big, but at the end of the day, it's not going to give you like a 20x, 30x, but it's all about perspective. If you have like a lot of money, I mean, feel free. I don't see anything wrong with it. I'm personally trading more of like lower and midcaps. I'm not focused on high caps, at least when it comes to the Memecoin space. And then if we're talking about like high high caps, I have a lot of like SUI, Solana obviously. But yeah, what's your process for finding these runners early? I have several guides on my personal YouTube channel. If you're not following my personal YouTube channel, obviously I do live streams here on Crypto Banter, but I also have my own YouTube channel. I'm returning on it on Monday, so expect a new video on Monday. And I'm actually filming a video explaining my current research process because I made a lot of videos in the past about it, but it's ever"

I'm returning on it on Monday, so expect a new video on Monday. And I'm actually filming a video explaining my current research process because I made a lot of videos in the past about it, but it's ever changing. So, I think it's mostly about identifying a meta, having the good setup. If you don't have the good setup, obviously you're not going to be in a position of finding the runners in the first place. So get on Axium, get on Padre, put the filters that work for you. Eliminate all the noise. So for instance, you remove all the rugs, the things that have migrated and have gone like sub 20k markup or something like that. You basically just identify all the filters that you need. And once you're in it, you basically have the right canvas to just like focus on what you're going to find. And then just go on Crypto Twitter, see what everybody is talking about. Identify the right meta. Don't bid on something that is completely dead. And obviously, it all depends like am I there's different type of trenching. There's people that focus on something like new pairs. If you focus on new pairs, you're going to have a completely different strategy of finding sort of blue chips are already in the 10 million plus in terms of market cap. So, I'm going to talk about it all in new videos, but I have already like plenty of guts. So, I could just like talk about this, but I would have to make it like a three-hour live stream because there's just too much to digress. And also everybody's going to have a different strategy. I have a strategy. Some other people that I trade with have different strategies from me. They both work. Just find what works for you. Because if you have if you make a lot of money with new pairs, I'm not going to tell you to buy midcaps. If you make a lot of money with midcaps, I'm not going to tell you to focus on new pairs. There's always a different strategy and different ways to make money. But if you just lock in, I know it sounds cliche, but if you lock in, if you find what works for you, you're just never going to go look back and you're going to make a lot of money. I know it sounds cliche, but it's really not. Okay. There's a lot of other things that I want to talk about today. I also want to remind you guys if you want to do futures,"

I know it sounds cliche, but it's really not. Okay. There's a lot of other things that I want to talk about today. I also want to remind you guys if you want to do futures, I have an insane offer. I was looking to start today, but I'm actually going to start from next week because I had just some technical problems in the back end. But from next week, I'm basically going to give away $2,000 every live stream as a trading bonus on Blofin. Blofin, I don't just do Memecoins. I also do futures perpetuals. And on Blofin, this is a platform that I'm using basically on every live stream. I'm going to select four people. So, I'm going to see I'm going to have the dashboard of Blofin. I'm going to see who registers with my link and how much money you deposit. So, all you got to do is deposit at least $1,000. You deposit $1,000, you start trading. And if I see that you deposit that amount of money and you started to use the platform, I'm going to select every week four different people, four different UIDs and I'm going to give you $500 that you can use to as a trading bonus to offset your trading fees. You're welcome. All you got to do is register with the link that is down below and join my next live streams here on Crypto Banter. Drop your UID and I'm going to check it. If you're eligible, I'm going to give you some money. That's it. No strings attached. All the terms and conditions by the way are on the landing page. Feel free to check them out. Now I also want to talk about another project that should be alpha. Um so as a lot of you know I'm also starting to dive into the field of prediction market. Although I'm not necessarily a specialist of prediction market, but it's definitely something that is more and more interesting that I'm getting more and more interested in especially because I saw some of my friends like make a lot of money with like some Maduro the Venezuelan president oriented stuff and I saw this project and they actually reached out to me. Is another sponsor of today's video by the way, full disclosure that is basically mastering sports betting or sports prediction market as we can call it right here with AI. So, it's basically going to be a coin that's going to launch and the utility of this is going to be to give you the best odds available"

So, it's basically going to be a coin that's going to launch and the utility of this is going to be to give you the best odds available in the market to bet on prediction markets that are sports oriented. I hope that I'm explaining this correctly, but the way that it works is that you can join the pre-sale and it's actually live for one day only. I'm going to try to drop a link down description or something like that. And you can buy this on PinkSale. I'm also going to put a post on Telegram, so feel free to check it out from there. And all you can do is basically you connect your MetaMask wallet, you buy a bag on pre-sale and as soon as the project gets launched and goes live, you're able to claim those tokens immediately to your MetaMask or Coinbase wallet, whatever, but anything that is that supports Ethereum. So this is not Phantom wallet, this is not Solana, but you buy a bag on pre-sale, the project launches, it launches in a couple of days. You claim the tokens and then you can sell them. In my experience, I cannot guarantee returns. Obviously, do your own research. It's still risky. It still can be less than the money you put. Obviously, do your own research. But in my experience, the only pre-sales that I've done on Pixel or this kind of platform have given me at least a 3x at launch. Obviously, previous performances don't guarantee future results. But I'm trusting my gut here. So, I do believe that it's going to send. I'm going to give an update next week obviously and see how the investment is going to how the trade is going to do. But if you can see just like the utility and how this has like impacted the field of like sports prediction 60% of win rate and an average of an increased average ROI on you know performance without this AI tool of 25 23% up in my opinion that's interesting on 18,000 kind of like trades bets however you want to call it they also have details about the tech which I'm not going to bore you with, but the website itself is Pikc. So, pikc.ai. Feel free to check it out. I'm also going to post on my Telegram the link to participate in the pre-sale. So, check it out. Also, I want to mention that the team is fully doxed. So, if something like this was not doxed, I would"

So, if something like this was not doxed, I would probably not bother investing in it. But given that it's fully doxed and you can research all these guys, they have LinkedIn profile and everything. It gives a little more trust and a little more authority. So, we're going to see about that. We're going to see about that. You can also feel free to see here the tokenomics blah blah blah. Everything is explained right there. Okay, more shills. Male. Okay, let's take a look. Let me close a few tabs because my laptop is exploding. M Whale. I guess it's another derivative of the White Whale. The mama whale. Oh, I think that Blay showed me this the other day. Bro, I would not be the short. So, if it loses the support line here. So, right now it's trading at this horizontal support. If it loses it, it's dead. Probably dies. Probably does something like this, bro. Zero. Zcash. Uh, I don't like Zcash, bro. I think that Zcash is not even a real privacy coin. So first of all, if a coin gives you the option of privacy, it's not a privacy coin. Like privacy should be by default. This is why Monero is a privacy coin and Zcash is not. Zcash is like a Bitcoin replica with privacy option. The core team left. Why would you buy it? Obviously, after we have a crash of 30% in one day, it's going to come back a little bit. Sure, because there's always a dead cat bounce. But I do believe that it's like bum then a bounce zero. So I think that my target for Zach is something like $200. Um if you are able to get a good entry would probably be a good short but yeah whatever. Easy looking to pop. Why? Why? I don't get it. Let's lock in smart guy. Okay the the last sponsor that I want to talk about today is Riv. You guys remember Rivcoin? It's a project that is launching soon. Let's see how much Plex can say. Plex is part of the team of Riv obviously and Plex is my closest collaborator. He's the PR guy in my Discord. Everybody knows him. Everybody loves him. So, I'm going to give the word to Plex for a little right. Still hear me? Whoops. And the magnet fell off. All right. What's up, bro? GM. GM. GM. You're here"

I mean, it's amazing to be I mean, look at look at the background. Yeah. I don't think I can show it, but we have a jacuzzi there. Can we Crazy mansion? Yeah. Do you see that? Like a freaking jacuzzi on the balcony. Crazy dump. All right. Absolutely. The stage is yours, bro. Absolutely. Yeah. So, I've been talking about Riv in the last three months, I think, on Crypto Banter. And um as I said a lot of times, I've been part of the team for more than two years now. And in these two years, Riv has been building and building, not only building tech, but also building um all the compliance side of things. You know when you want to have a serious project, launch a serious project, you always have to take in accounting also all the legal aspects and this is a very important thing. All the team is doxed as you can see from X you can go on the website see the CEO see listen to what the vision is and understand more and more of it. Something else that we have been doing we have been giving away thousands and thousands of dollar. We'll be giving away more than 18K in the last year or so, like nine months or so. And we just did like another challenge, a new challenge about clipping this live stream. And we're going to do another one very similar. So make sure you join the community, join the Telegram, join the Discord. Don't miss out on these opportunities. And as Cepryl said, Riv is gonna launch very soon. So the only way you have to be early on the launch to be the first ones to buy the coin is to join the communities. Join the communities. Visit the website. There's also a whitelist you can apply in to get a potential airdrop. So join the whitelist the communities. It's free money. And don't miss out. I mean if you want to be early on this that's the way you have to do it. So, make sure to follow Riv, join the communities, and we're also running monthly giveaways of $1,000 split between five people. So, that's $200 each.

I mean check it out. Appreciate you. Thank you for being here. What's the alpha? What are we buying on Memecoins on a less serious note? Well, I don't know if you can hear Plex, but Remis is just Yeah, we have a note that Remis is sending back. Guess somebody likes it. I do. What are these buys? What are those? Okay, I'll leave it to that. It would be funny to just like come back to this live stream in a few days and I see Remis that goes to to the millions. I mean, we'll see about that. I'm basically gonna watch the chart from the jacuzzi and enjoy beautiful managing Colombia. So, I'll speak to you soon, guys. Thank you for being here. Drop a like, obviously. Follow all of my platforms down in the description. Let's get cooking. Let's make 2026 the year that we make a lot of money in the trenches in crypto. Let's bring it on. Speak soon. See you."
