      "text": "Banter Fam, happy Monday to you all. New start of the week, new weekly candle closes, giving us a little bit of insight. If I look at the last weekly close, it did show that this week would start off red, but it is showing us we should start off quite aggressively to the green side at the end of the week. There are a couple of big things that I want to show you guys today. Momentum is starting to change, specifically midterm on a lot of altcoins. I want to show you guys the key tools to see which altcoins are stronger than the rest right now. I want to paint this picture for you that we are starting to shift the tides. The bear is starting to slowly run out and we are starting to get really strong indicators to show that over the next couple of weeks we are going to see some upside within the markets. We can then take that information and strategize where we are putting our money. What amount of money are we going to be trading where? What are we leaving for the midterm? What are we leaving for the long term? What bots are we using? It is so important for you to have structure and understanding of what is strong and where we are right now. I think the big question has been, are the tides turning? I am here to show you guys today that I am seeing on specifically 10 to 20 good altcoins that we are starting to get bullish momentum back into the market. So guys, happy Monday to you all. Missed you all. Last show was on Saturday. New week, new start. Let's get a game plan. Let's go. I try and help everyone in my space and this is what I get. I try and fight the devils, but inside I am just like, yes, squad, how are we all doing? Hope you have had a great weekend and are nice and recharged. Now let's start going through a plan for the week. First, I want to start by making sure that you are seeing opportunities when they are coming. It is very important when things are starting to turn. Even though we are still seeing a little bit of chop within the markets, we saw some strength come in and I think the question is, was that strength enough to break structure? If so, when you see redness like we are seeing at the start of this week, this is activation redness. This is confidence. I am building on this current pullback. Was the pump enough on whatever altcoin you are paying attention to? Was it enough to break structure? If it was enough to break structure, it is very important to have the confidence to enter the trades. It is very important to get on the horse and look at the best strategy you can use.

If it was enough to break structure, it is very important to have the confidence to enter the trades. It is very important to get on the horse and look at the best strategy you can use. You have learned from the past. There have been times this market has taken money and given money in the last year. You need to activate on this pullback. You cannot allow past fear to slow you down. Today is a starting point of you getting back on the horse and having confidence behind your trades. For me, I will always have bad and good streaks. But one thing that will never die with me is I know that my wins are bigger than my losses. The confidence is what really drives me to get back my money or to get way ahead. It is not about being perfect or winning more than losing, but confidence is a big thing. I want you to go recap your career in crypto. Look at where you went right, where you went wrong, and what worked really well for you in the past. I want you to play your strengths. May this be only spot trading, leverage trading, investing, or bots. The key this year is to play your strengths. When it comes to experimentals, play them with one or two percent of the capital. When you can sit on a red day and enter trades with confidence, that is when you know you are comfortable with that strategy. The big mistake many traders make is going too big into a new narrative too quickly. There is a cycle to everything. If I learn something on two percent and then activate thirty percent of my account four months later, you are setting up good fundamentals. If you are desperate to make money back, play your strengths. Are you really good at leverage right now or are you really good at spot trades? What is your number one A-game? Make sure seventy percent of your time right now is playing A and B because it is conservative time. It is time to not lose anymore. Keep growing, but grow with ten to twenty percent. As this market starts to break structures and move up again, those plan B, C, and D strategies will be used. Let's jump into what is happening right now. Can I get some likes? I am going to give away five Bitfunded accounts today. Get the likes up. I will choose them in the stream. Get yourself into a routine on a Monday. I want to look at things on a high time frame. Look"

I am going to give away five Bitfunded accounts today. Get the likes up. I will choose them in the stream. Get yourself into a routine on a Monday. I want to look at things on a high time frame. Look at where we closed on Bitcoin price. We closed with a red candle. The reason why there is a start of redness right now is this wick. We had some strength but ultimately closed red and left a wick, which means liquidity is sitting lower down. That is why the market wants to come down and capture liquidity. Have we broken structure to say that it is a big week of redness ahead? If I look at that, we have not broken structure. We are actually coming into support. In a bullish scenario, the market will come down, pull this liquidity, and we will see growth to the upside. An accelerated amount of growth happens when we break that trend to the upside. Right now, the market is starting to slow down its range. Bitcoin altcoins range is a little bit bigger. I am always confident in support buys. I am not confident in resistance buys. When Bitcoin was at 94,000 or 93,000, I was not buying because that is straight into resistance. I am confident when we hit support. Redness is actually very good and greenness is actually very bad for entries. The moment we start to switch those two things around, you start to find success. We have been taught to chase things that are green, but then we are always late to the party. The people who made all the money were fishing in the red previously. You do not want to arrive when the club is about to close. The best time is to get there early and be part of the party as it is rallying. The only way you get in early is to fish when not many are fishing. As it stands now, have we broken any structure to the downside? No. My bottom trend line validates that. RSI has been sitting at the bottom and we are about to exit. Every time we have exited, we have sped up. Bitcoin has been oversold on the weekly since the first week of September 2025. We are sitting at four or five months of the market being oversold. The bulls do come back into play and buying power does return. The bears are arrogant. They are certain Bitcoin is going down to 50,000 dollars. We all know what happens to arrogance in this space. Tides turn and tides wipe people out. Where is max"

Tides turn and tides wipe people out. Where is max pain right now? What will catch the market most off guard? Most people think 70,000 dollars is more believable than 150,000 dollars. Do not be surprised if the market goes for max pain, which is always going against the tides. When Bitcoin was above 100K, people really believed in a 200K play. That is when the off-guard move catches everyone. What is up, Fefe? Good to see you, bro. Altcoins had a little bit of a red candle as well. But look at the wick from last week on the downside. It is much smaller than the Bitcoin wick. Altcoins are getting a little bit stronger. They are holding downside better than they previously did. The pullbacks are starting to get smaller because there is no one left to shake out. We broke some key structures and trends. We are on hot zones with a higher high in play on the weekly. Charts are saying altcoins are gaining momentum. When they get bullish, they get really bullish. The key is to buy them now rather than six months from now when they are aggressive. Bitcoin dominance is telling the same story. Look at this candle. It closed red and has a big wick to the downside. High time frame shows we lost that big trend. It is very likely this is going to start dropping aggressively. This aligns with Total 3, which is showing a retest and a push to the upside. Waves to the upside start off slow and then increase. The next wave is the hope phase, and that is the bigger leg up. You can use moving averages to look at sentiment and momentum. Put in a 20 MA and a 50 MA on the daily time frame. These moving averages show when momentum is shifting. You are looking for a cross. When we crossed to the upside previously, we rallied from 60,000 to 100,000 dollars. When we crossed to the downside, we went from 97,000 down to 80,000. Right now, the lines are just starting to cross and holding support areas. This is not just slightly bullish; it is a significant shift. Bitcoin is starting to show strength. Now let's look at the altcoins. SUI pumped and made a way higher high. We see the cross on SUI. This is what you should be paying attention to buy on this pullback. SUI is the signal. Cardano"

Now let's look at the altcoins. SUI pumped and made a way higher high. We see the cross on SUI. This is what you should be paying attention to buy on this pullback. SUI is the signal. Cardano has not crossed yet. It is still in a downtrend and is one of the weaker coins right now. It does not mean it won't pump, but it is not the shiniest object yet. I am more interested in building SUI bots today. Is there a cross on ETH? Yes, there is. We are in support to buy right now. This is where I need to build my ETH positions. Solana is very close to the cross. It is looking stronger than a lot of altcoins. Solana will really pump when it breaks the high it has not touched since October. 130 to 140 is a good area to accumulate for the long term. AVAX is on the verge of a cross and coming into support. Chainlink is coming into the test but has not crossed fully yet. It is a good area for the long term, but maybe not the trading token for today. Fetch is seeing a golden cross and coming down to test. Render has been strong and is a great area to build on this pullback. Algo has broken out and is on the verge of a cross. Doge is not mega bullish yet but is a good place to accumulate before the market wakes up. Zcash is losing momentum to the downside, so it is not the most exciting short-term play. Bitcoin is starting to show a cross. Large caps like SOL are starting to break structures. We are not in a full alt season yet because smaller coins pump only after money has already come into the big caps. Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL will bring the most liquidity into crypto first. I am paying attention to blue chips. LIDO is showing strength and coming to retest. Gaming like Illuvium is not strong right now. The 20 MA tracks the last 20 days and the 50 MA is a higher time frame tool. When we start losing the 50 MA, that is when we see big changes. The 50 MA is a powerful tool to tell you when to exit. Right now, it is the lowest risk in the market to enter in the last two years. If you look after the downside, the upside will come naturally. Those with the cojones to get in when things are shifting are the ones who get rich. I am allocating to bots on Pionex right now. These"

Those with the cojones to get in when things are shifting are the ones who get rich. I am allocating to bots on Pionex right now. These are low leverage with stop losses. On my Bitfunded accounts, I am at 99,300. I am waiting for the next opportunity. On the short time frame for Bitcoin, I do not see us dropping much lower than 89,800 before pushing to 94,000. The market might be crappy for the next 24 to 48 hours, but look for upside around Wednesday. I am looking at a short-term relief rally for Zcash. It is a 13 percent trade. Bitfunded has raised the maximum loss and daily loss limits. The buy one get one free promotion is running out today. It is one of the safest ways to trade leverage. ETH dominance looks strong. SUI against Bitcoin is also showing outperformance. Beam is a good long-term accumulate but might need a few weeks for real momentum. Do not miss the hope pumps. David, Shane, Devie Diva, and Roberto, you all get Bitfunded accounts. I am fighting with Cryptomanran in a good way to get crypto live trading started. Have a fantastic day. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye."
