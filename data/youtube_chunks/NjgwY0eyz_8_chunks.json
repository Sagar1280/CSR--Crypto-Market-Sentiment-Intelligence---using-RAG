      "text": "[music] The Bitcoin trap is almost set. And in today's video, we'll talk about why price is dumping, who the most likely candidates, whether that be the bulls or the bears, are going to be the ones that are trapped in the following days and weeks to come. What you should do next to avoid this and not only avoid it, but actually profit off of it. So stay tuned till the end of the show. Smash the like button. Let's get straight into the show content. We are seeing a sea of red and it's got a lot to do with of course Trump which we'll talk about in a moment. So why exactly is price dumping? Well, one of the things started to take place I guess from a technical perspective which I spoke about in whroom discord on the update yesterday basically saying that uh I am going to be looking for prices to come down probably in the short term as well. Remember we had that short-term upside bias and I said that part of the reason why is you are starting to see a lot of the crypto charts uh coming within terms of the altcoin sector being a leading indicator taking out the Tuesday the 13th uh candle 13th of of January candle that was the candle that brought a little bit of optimism I call them the we're so back bull cheerleaders those guys started to come back into play and that was based on that candle and you didn't want to take out that candle was this one over here and I said I'm expecting most of these coins to come back down towards new lows. We do have a couple of trade setups as well. We'll cover one of those today based off of this whereby you can probably profit off of the downside move. So, a lot of it of course fundamentally has to do with Trump coming out. You can see over here he says Denmark has been unable to do anything about it about that being Greenland and Russia. And he says now it is time and it will be done. So, you're seeing those tensions arise. You're seeing Trump coming out and announcing 10% tariffs on eight different EU countries demanding an acquisition of Greenland. So this narrative is building up steam over here and consequently what we saw is the S&P 500 futures chart come down negative um 0.7% NASDAQ down 1% Dow Jones.5% and then actually gold and silver immediately shot back up continuing its bull run over there 1% and 3% respectively. So, we have officially hit takerit zone one over here on gold. It's officially come into that. That was when we set this trade up all the way back here on the 25th of November, right? We've seen that continuation now higher. And I'm expecting gold to still go even higher from here. Silver extending its gains. We spoke about how you could get into a position last week where you didn't want to take out that low. That was the candle to flush people out on the 15th of January on Thursday. As long as you were long with a stop loss below there, you could hold that position pretty much. Leave your stop in the same place. No need to change that. Looking at continuation higher. And then we have the platinum trade which is still getting ready to take off. Um you shouldn't have been stopped out. I wouldn't change anything. Leave the stop loss in exactly the same place there. Uh and what is going on on copper? Not too much. Lot of liquidity building up over here on copper. So if you are long on copper, of course, do be careful on that. And then I just want to touch on two charts over here. One is Tesla. I do think Tesla is going to come back a little bit deeper towards this trend line. Will it hold? I guess it's going to come down to the rise in tensions, geopolitical tensions, the tariff warfare. It's probably going to affect this as well. You may see a bit of a deeper sweep, but we have to have an invalidation somewhere because if you take out this low, you're probably coming for these lows. And then we just need to re-evaluate on that trade. We have a head short that's on the table as well. Um, and that that is Apple. Apple was too weak to even get back into the triangle. We spoke about the potential that maybe it could come up here. If it did, this would be the most likely place for rejection. Didn't even get that far."

We spoke about the potential that maybe it could come up here. If it did, this would be the most likely place for rejection. Didn't even get that far. Already starting to round out and roll over. And the expectation is a move down for Apple down to 235. So, still holding on to this trade over here for a short. Um, we can move on into what you can expect as well leading on to the rest of the year as per fractals go. Well, usually what we see is into this midterm period. And I want to reiterate this is taking a lot of data and aggregating each year, one over the top of each other all the way from 1928 to the current levels. What we tend to see is the first year in office does lead to upside. Midterms lead to a little bit of downside consolidation and then pre-election year you start to reaccumulate. Uh price moves up aggressively and in the election year again continuation. So, in terms of that midterm year, there is a possibility if we do start to see a lot of these magnificent sevens rolling over, which we now have very few that are in uptrend, right? A lot of them are starting to turn over and the S&P 500 turns over as well. Well, that could bring that downside. That brings in the Bitcoin low for the end of the bare market which as per timing cycles which we followed all the way from the beginning to the end of the bull run was remember 1,85ish days was give or take the time period that we're looking at. Well, now you're looking you're following a similar trajectory. Usually it's between 365 and about 400 days give or take. So you're giving it about one year from top to bottom to October to October. And so far we are still following that, right? We're following that trajectory. We are following peak five which is taking it from peak back down to trough. This is the purple line. Everything is still in order over here in relationship to cycle four, three, and two. We've left out cycle one because it was too young. Uh so we'll skip that one. So what does that mean? What what that typically means is that you can start to target the long-term holder realized price for a major bottom which is actually lining up over here at $38,000. Now, there will of course be bounces along the way, and the question you have to ask yourself is, are the short-term holders going to get back into profit? For them to get back into profit, you need to see price breaking above 98,365. It did happen a couple of times within the bull run where we lost it, reclaimed, lost it, reclaimed, lost it, reclaimed. But the question is, are we in this environment where the arrows are pointing up to lose it and reclaim? Are we in this environment above my head over here where you rally into that short-term holder cost basis and then turn back over once again? Well, at least you guys know where my mindsets at. I think that there's a higher probability uh based on many other factors that we probably in this environment and then you can see you tend to move back towards realized price. Realized price is what we call fair value for Bitcoin. This is um you know based on onchain metrics how the miners are doing and that is in that $56,000 region which almost always elicits at least a technical bounce and then you revisit back into that long-term holder realized price which over time is moving up. So it could be between 38 and $45,000 probably by the time that level does get hit. That's going to be one of the longer term targets over there. Another thing that we're looking at is the uh price entering into quicksand on the Gausian channel."

So it could be between 38 and $45,000 probably by the time that level does get hit. That's going to be one of the longer term targets over there. Another thing that we're looking at is the uh price entering into quicksand on the Gausian channel. Now remember, by the time the Gausian channel turns red, uh the worst is pretty much over and you're basically at your bare market lows. But what we typically see is once you break back into that Gausian channel on the weekly scale, you tend to see price lose the midband, bounce back up above the midband, and then follow through and lose the lower band. by the time it loses the low band, everybody knows that it's a bare market and it's all in full agreement and then it's just a waiting game for a couple of months later to set in the major low and then reaccumulate. So to avoid this quicksand disaster for Bitcoin on the weekly scale, you would actually need price to rally all the way back up and reclaim that $110,000 level. So, for anyone that's a long-term trader, investor, swing trader, whatever it is you want to call it, and you're holding positions for months to even years, this is probably pretty important for you to consider that price is weak until you can get back above that 110K level. And that simultaneously would get you back above the short-term holder realized price, which means that the short-term holders, the speculators, um, who came in late, of course, under a lot of pressure and strain over here. and that can lead to lower prices if they decide that they want to cut those losses. So, we spoke about this. We spoke about the similarities. Now, could you spike up a little bit higher one more time? It's possible. But we looked at the timing factor over here as well. And if you zoom in from the low to that peak, well, that took nine weeks, right? Nine weeks and then things started to fade. So, you need to see sustained price action above um of course the super guppy indicator. We are on the ninth week right now. This is nine weeks from the low to current price. nine weeks exactly like before and price is starting to roll over. So that's what you have to ask yourself from a timing perspective. You know, maybe you have one more week of upside, but based on last week's candle, um you guys know the saying, it's not looking good, bro. It's not looking good, right? Below the super guppy indicator over here on the weekly scale, starting to compress over there. Um and ultimately also rejected off of the 50 EMA and the 21 EMA, which is angled down. Stop and reversal indicator also dropping off over there. So, a lot of work. Look at the confluence as well. The confluence between that 21 EMA at $97,000, stop and reversal indicator at $98,900. And then we can of course go back to this and that's also at $98,000 for that short-term holder realized price. So, those are some of the levels that you would want to see reclaimed before you can shift your bias on the high time frame. Everything is still in struggle street. Now, in the very short term, of course, you could get a little bit of a short squeeze, a final gasp of air from the bulls before they let go, which would lead to a little bit of an upside move. And the the primary reason for that would be based on the funding, which we're starting to see go really negative. We're also seeing over here the long to short ratio across the top 10 coins over the last 24 hours. This is quite a big skew, 4.48%. of course fear driven in relationship to what's going on um in the geopolitical tensions over there and um ultimately whenever we start to see this approach around that negative five or positive five we start to look to counter trade that in the opposite direction."

Now we have to go on the lower time frames to really make sense of this. So just consider that as a potential option whilst combining that with negative funding across the board over here on the deltas on high block capital right short short across the board negative almost 5% over there and I've been watching this funding rate all over the course of the weekend and it's actually been hovering between panic and uncertainty showing a little bit more shorts entering the market than usual and we have liquidated a huge amount of longs right um over the course of this dump that just occurred recently over the last hours. Uh we've seen 788 million uh taken out. Now there's only about four of us left in the space. So I don't know which four people those were that got liquidated over there. But um you know take it easy on the leverage, right? You don't want to participate as part of this cohort of people over here that keep getting taken out. So now only 83 million in the last 24 hours from the short side. So will we get one more last gasp of air? I think we'll only know that once we print the Monday range. You have to remain a little bit more patient. So that that answer is going to come out in tomorrow's video, which is why you want to be each and every single day. Daily exchange volume also still struggling over there. Uh ETF flow started to go back into outflows. We'll see how that follows through, especially over the course of today. Usually following um weekend price action that comes towards the downside. We do tend to see more aggressive selling from the ETFs because they're late, right? they always they're not trading 24/7 like the rest of the market. Um so if we have a look over here USDT dominance we spoke about this the pullback zone maybe you would get five to maybe 5.35% for a major bottom but we said that was the best case scenario in terms of generating a little bit of relief. So we'll see over the coming weeks if this is going to start to trade higher. It's my personal belief that we will ultimately trade at minimum into this 8% region which is of course going to cause a little bit of problems over there for the bulls. So if you do want to look for trades, remember guys, we are trading as well on gravity. Still don't forget about that. You're still getting the big airdrop. Uh and they're giving you 10% 10% on the uh interest that is on the capital that you have within that trading account. So there is a link below if you guys want to follow along on that gravity. I'm looking for a new trade. I might take one of those today which I dropped in the the discord over the course of the weekend for trade setup. So um we still waiting for the big move. This could be leading to continuation towards downside. Remember we spoke about this bowlinger band um expands. Bowlinger band with percentile is an indicator that we use to showcase how much volatility. So volatility picks up, price comes down, corrective phase, there you go to create the flag of a bare flag. There you go, the flag portion of your bare flag. Volatility recontracts while you print out the flag. And then if this begins to expand now with downside price action rejecting off that middle bowlinger band, of course, you know comes next. It's going to be the next portion of the measured move for the bare flag um to play out in full over there. So keep an eye on that. Very very very important. Here you have it again."

It's going to be the next portion of the measured move for the bare flag um to play out in full over there. So keep an eye on that. Very very very important. Here you have it again. Bare flag rejecting and losing it. It reclaimed it temporarily. It was one good sign, but I told you don't count your chickens before they hatch. You need to see multiple candles closing back above the point of control over there at 95,280. You failed that level and now you're coming back down. There is volume support still coming in in this 87k region. But as a general rule of thumb, just consider if price starts to lose $90,000, well, this could start to break that down very quickly and lead to much lower prices. So, we'll watch as that unfolds. I also spoke about this. Um, this is your Tuesday candle. Remember Tuesday the 13th. You wanted to hold that. And there it is on point on quue. I'll pop it on and off the screen. The bare moon, right? Bare moon prints. Price comes down. Now, it's a game of can bulls defend to create a higher low. Well, they've already lost one of the key levels that personally I wouldn't have wanted to see lost, which was measuring from this local low to this local high. You wanted to see price come into that 50%. This was also your short-term 50% resistance level. So, preferably bulls should have held this level. And I actually only thought you had hit that level by Wednesday, but of course, the Trump news that came out uh most recently accelerated this further down. So the levels to reclaim, you basically want to see bulls get back above here to start to shift anything uh back into their favor. Otherwise, just consider this week and consider it very likely and probable that you're going to take out that low from this candle that led to the upside. Right? So that is the one thing that you want to watch out for. And then everyone's going to be on high alerts looking at the 50 EMA. So this was the long trade. We did take multiple profits along the way. I did mention as well throughout um you know TP1, TP2 and leaving the final TP3 for the top there. This was a counter rally trade which you want to be incredibly incredibly careful of um you know because the the trend is still or counter trend trade is still coming towards the downside and there's still a lot of risk uh based on these weeklies based on what you're seeing over here. All right so moving on uh let's see what else we got in terms of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Basically, the line in the sand is around that $3 trillion mark. It's 3.02. If you do start to see this level get taken out, the red line, of course, it's a threat against all this liquidity that's pent up over here. All these stop losses um and key psychological levels will probably be swept and then ultimately going to be going down to possibly 2.52 trillion, which is going to be your strong horizontal support. So, you do want to be aware of that. You want to keep that on your watch list. That is around the $3 trillion mark. Right? So I said Bitcoin trading under 90K bad. Total one trading under $3 trillion. Bad, right? Bad for bulls, good for bears means low prices for them. So what do we do with all of this? Let's have a look at some of the other charts. We spoke about taking profits on Monero and Monero probably throwing back into this as the most likely bounce zone. Now you've come into that zone and you are starting to bounce. But I do think that this is now time to pay attention on Monero that maybe Monero's run has come to its end. You have a inverse fair value gap over here that I would personally be watching out for."

You have a inverse fair value gap over here that I would personally be watching out for. And I'll change the color over here to make it a bit easier. Um let's just see what color we got that one in. And let's make it [clears throat] we'll make it pink over there. There we go. So inverse fair value gap. Monero is going to be despite the little bounce and despite it's up 10.17% today while the rest of the market is absolutely um you know puking this is still going to be a major resistance zone over here and I would personally be very very very cautious in taking any new positions or um you know and and consider actually offloading some positions if you haven't already into this 670 up to about 700 right so it's I'm giving you about $30 range. I'll even write 30 on there. $30 range between 670 and 700 is where I would personally expect that um if this is going to be the low high territory, that's the most likely place for the rejection. We can double check this as well with some of the fibs. And let's just quickly do that with um as much precision as possible. Uh the again the 50% level does line up as well exactly exactly over there at that 665. So marginally short of that. And then of course you got the golden pocket uh just a smidge above. So I like that as a major major area where you're probably going to be looking for rejection. If that does happen, I will take further profits, right? Because currently on on Monero, we're still up 131%. We're still holding about another $3,300. We took um I think a good half of the profits off the table over there. So probably I'll shave some of that as well um if if that does reject. So keep that on your watch list. Let's go into the next one which was on our watch list as one I said wait for price to come into that zone and that's Tron right we've come into the area of interest now Tron we spoke about the massive buildup of liquidity over here we're coming into the rejective zone it's not enough you need to wait for this to begin to change direction and have a confirmed reversal now you know if you want to really really split hairs maybe you could say that's already taking place in the form of closing lower highs these rejective wicks over here it it's exactly at the 50% level. But I personally am going to wait for a little bit more confirmation, a bit of a breakdown, the next move up into a lower high, something like that. I'm I'm I'm more willing to enter over there and then I can reduce the risk with a stop just above that and we can look for lower prices over there. So those are the trades that I'm looking at in the um I guess immediate short term. Let's go back onto the daily over here and see what else is going on. So, we got Pippen. Pippen is starting to break down as well. Let me go actually on the hourly. Um, it's in profit over here. We're just waiting for further confirmation. If we can start to take out some of these lows, 29 cents on a closing basis, we should get that acceleration down uh on the pipin trade. Um, okay. What else? What are the other ones that we had? Uh, let's see. Let's see. Let's see over here. Go to a few more. Um, all righty. So, if you're worried about liquidity, by the way, I see in the comments some of you are worried about liquidity on some of the other exchanges. Guys, remember you can trade this as well. Pippen is listed."

Pippen is listed. If you want Pippen, if you want Tron, those trades are listed as well on Bybit. They're giving you a $30,000 signup bonus and $50 immediately um uh just for joining, right? So, $50 guaranteed, $30,000 depending on how much you deposit over there on Bybit. So, we're looking for this to run all the way back down to the base at 0.027. Uh, next, what else have we got? Um, XRP, you know, still no man's land. It's come all the way back down. There is a bit of demand that's coming in, but what did I say? You've taken out those Tuesday gains. This is what you didn't want to see. You wanted to see followthrough if bullish. Most of these coins, Tuesday gains. Uh, here was the Tuesday candle. You've taken out that Tuesday candle. Subie, here it is. Tuesday candle. You've taken out the Tuesday candle. Expect full retrace, right? Full retrace and probably even below because now when when SUI comes all the way back down to this base at 139, once it comes into that level, it's probably going to take all of this out. 1 2 3 4 and the fifth test over here. You're coming back for that. You're going to sweep through all of that. It's probably going to come down a whole lot more. Um there you have uh Sonic about to go into price discovery to the downside, new lows. Uh we have basically new lows over there on say we have Cardano coming back to this key support. How strong is it though? I wouldn't be too optimistic that that's going to hold either. Uh AVAC probably going to take out those lows. Ton probably coming back down for those lows and new lows. Um I would expect Casper to come into about 0.0359. We we've spoken about this one. XPL little bit of demand coming in. Maybe a double bottom but um yeah hard to be optimistic on this. like if really really bullish you can look at a possible W formation but uh you know just against the rest of the market very very very unlikely. Okay, I'll give a little bit of benefit of the doubt to to pump because this is super key support. If it can flip this it's okay. Uh otherwise not much to say over there. We got hyperlquid. I saw there's a massive hyperlquid seller that's just like tewapping huge sell orders. So you I I still leaving these previous targets that we had mentioned for the downside 1956 and then 1724 AA created new lows right very bearish new lows and then we have lighter price discovery to the downside and coming for that 70% move I think it will sweep $1 at some point um okay APEC Apex we're already covered nothing to say over there I saw as well uh breaking down into new lows this was the original target into the 21 cents region. So, it's pretty brutal. Pretty brutal out there. Um, there was a really good tweet that I saw. Let me just see if I can quickly find that. I don't know if I'm going to find that tweet now. It was so far down. Uh, let me just see. Give me a second. It was It was really good. I feel like I have to share this with you guys. Um, I I need it in their words, not mine. Uh, wait, is it here? No, no, no, no. Let me go a little bit more. While we at it, guys, go and vote on the poll. There is a poll that I'm running right now. As always, I'd love to see um your guys thoughts on the market and we'll we'll visit that in just a moment. Let me see if I can find this."

Because that's kind of what the market is like with altcoins, which is why I say you got to be careful because, you know, 19 99% down and then they celebrate this 15% pump and that's currently um you know, the environment of what we've just witnessed and then of course you take out those lows again. Anyways, the tweet the tweet is much better. Um, let's go on to the polls. What are you guys on over here? Is the local top in? Local top is in and it's down only from now. 38% of you believe that we have nine or 20% now have voted yes. Uh, the local top is in, but we're going to take out the highs later. And then we got 39% of you guys buying the dip. Look, buy the right dip. That's the first thing. Secondly, buy the right at least asset, token, speculative uh coin, whatever it is you want to call it, buy the right thing because most of these things um as I've just shown you, uh there's the the proof is in the pudding, right? It's down only for most of these altcoins. So, so if you are buying the dip, buy the right asset and buy the right dip. Very very very important. Um all righty, Zcash, we can have a look at. Yes, I don't know if we we covered that. We may have skipped it. Zcash. This was my expectation. It is getting a little bit of a bounce in demand, but I'm still sticking with my drawing. I still think that ultimately this is going to start to bleed out towards 306 and then you're going to start to trade under 306 and then it's an acceleration down to destiny, which is going to be full retrace at $50. That's my personal opinion. Um, and I told you I would change my opinion if you started to reclaim some key levels or if you just ranged between 303 and 530 for a long time. That's what you would need to see um to change that. All righty. What else? I know a lot of you want to see some meme coin things. I'm seeing requests on S&P back down to the lows, triple bottom. Is it going to be the case? Probably not. It's probably going to break down and go in for new lows. Uh, one, two, three tests into that level. I see there's requests for Bonk. Bonk as well. I wouldn't be too optimistic. It's probably also going to continue to bleed out. Butthole is already losing absolutely everything. And I think also new lows are on the table for Butthole. It's just a matter of time. Um what else? What else have we got over here? Let me know in the comments, guys. Useless. We can have a look at useless. And useless is actually up 2.45% today. But I personally would not be optimistic. I am relatively confident that it's going to do something like that. Okay. Relatively confident that that's its future. Okay. Platinum. I think we covered platinum. We'll quickly go back there. Um platinum. There it is. That's a platinum trade. Platinum trade trades for you guys. Left, right, and center. We've given you a whole bunch today. It is all linked in the description below. If you want a place to trade platinum, um you can do it over here on BTCC, right? BTCC have commodities listed over there as well. Okay, so that's it from me folks."
