[music] >> Let us go to moon. Yo, welcome everyone to today's cryptocurrency price prediction and technical analysis live stream. On today's live stream, we really need to talk about many different things about Bitcoin, about Ethereum and also we are going to do later in the live stream XRP technical analysis. We are going to talk about what other people are right now doing in the market because it really does look like the CVD indicator right here looks very very interesting. Also, we need to talk about our WXY correction. Bitcoin right now potentially already finished. We are going to talk about the exact Fibonacci extension and also um and also high term time frame areas of support and resistances. And additionally, I'm going to show you one very important level that ideally it is going to get reclaimed literally in the upcoming hours. So far, yes, I do remain in my short trade on Bitcoin approximately from $92,000 US area, but also I do remain in my long trade from much lower and both of the trade both of the trades at least as of right now are being in a very nice profit. We are definitely going to talk about the trading setups and also later we can also take a look at the performance of both of the trading bots. They have been performing I would say quite nicely. Ideally I would like to get more profit out of this right here because currently we are approximately let's just say uh 11.4% in a profit after 51 days. So we are definitely going to see how those bots are going to perform once potentially Bitcoin is going to get another push towards some signed. Now before we start I would just like to welcome everyone on the stream. Uh Sonic uh Lizini Cyperhawk Warmach uh Emperor Franic. Welcome everyone that is right now joining right here. Um, I really do hope that everyone is going to enjoy today's cryptocurrency live stream and I'm really going to try and provide to you as much information as possible to what I think is potentially going to happen with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and also maybe later in the video uh later in the live stream, we can also maybe talk about other altcoins. But right now, of course, welcome everyone right here. Let's go straight uh into our chart right here. You probably know that for the past few days, we have been paying attention towards our liquidity level at approximately $91,700. And look at how nicely this specific level has been respected. Bitcoin hit the level almost to the exact dollar accuracy. Uh not only the liquidity level, but of course also the anchored VW web when we anchor it at this specific high. Both of the levels were hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy. And right now, Bitcoin is literally trading exactly below this specific level. So overall speaking, of course, if you watched yesterday's video, you probably know that for the past few days, Bitcoin is simply in some kind of a horizontal range. We got a rotation from the bottom of the range back towards the top of the range. Even right now the bottom of the range right here. Later in the video I'm going to share with you exactly why this specific area is still going to be quite an important quite an quite actually a nice area of support. But right now in our horizontal range are we looking slightly more bullish or are we looking slightly more bearish? Now if you are in my free VIP discord server uh later uh earlier today I posted a very important chart here where I said bearish absorption continues to form on Bitcoin. That's a bearish sign. Why so? Because simply the entire time we have been trading at this specific area. Yes, Bitcoin has been pushing slightly higher right here. But the thing is it was still a lower high generally speaking on the 30-inut time frame on the CVD indicator. Clearly we are also getting a push towards the upside. But because we are forming a lower high here, it is simply going to be bearish absorption. And there are different uh strengths of this bearish divergences or and also when we are forming bullish divergences, we can say there are different strengths."

But because we are forming a lower high here, it is simply going to be bearish absorption. And there are different uh strengths of this bearish divergences or and also when we are forming bullish divergences, we can say there are different strengths. which one is the uh is the the biggest or actually the biggest uh bearish indication is when you get open interest increase in the middle of when the bearish or bullish divergence is being formed. So what you can see right here open interest was definitely increasing towards the upside while CVD indicator was pushing towards the upside while Bitcoin was forming a lower high. So what does it mean? It means people are buying Bitcoin. People are people are literally longing Bitcoin but they are not able to push the price higher because simply it was a brand new lower high. It means bearish absorption bearish divergence and of course definitely a sign of weakness on the 30inut time frame. So purely looking at the orderflow, not looking at any ranges, not looking at any exponential moving averages, not looking at any liquid uh liquidation levels right here, not looking at anything else, but only the CVD indicator, open interest and also the Bitcoin price itself. It would be very much logical if of course people are buying Bitcoin, they are longing Bitcoin, buying pressure is coming in, it would make sense for us to get a push towards the upside. But this right here was not the case. higher high on CVD pushed towards the upside on open interest bearish absorption because of that because clearly Bitcoin did not get a push toward the upside. So what we are getting right here right now or should I say what we have been getting for the past few days at this specific area right now on BTC definitely was a bearish Bitcoin indication. However, what you're rightly going to see for the past few hours, we have been getting a lower low on bit on the CV indicator, but a higher low on Bitcoin. Now, the open interest, at least as of right now, is not really getting a push towards the upside. The entire time we have been forming this specific bullish absorption. Yes, price has been going higher. Open interest at this specific area is definitely going lower but also the open interest clearly you're going to see it is getting a push towards downside. So what we said before the strongest um bearish or bullish absorption is when you do get open interest increase. So that is why this specific level because open interest got it pushed towards upside. I wouldn't really say that um if we compare right now the bearish and also the bullish absorption right here. I would definitely say the bearish one is a stronger one because the open interest has been getting a push towards the upside versus with the bullish one right here the open interest is getting a push towards downside."

I would definitely say the bearish one is a stronger one because the open interest has been getting a push towards the upside versus with the bullish one right here the open interest is getting a push towards downside. Right now looking at the orderflow in my opinion it is still looking slightly more bearish and if you look like that technically speaking we do have right now a higher probability of moving towards downside simply because people are buying Bitcoin right here a lot of them are longing Bitcoin but the thing is the price is not really moving higher and also I did share with you a trading setup I think uh yeah right here 3 days ago I shared with you this trading setup Not saying this will play out but the risk-to-reward ratio of this specific long trade right here was actually very very nice approximately 5.5 uh to1 which yeah it is a beautiful risk risk-to-reward ratio if of course right now we are going to continue higher but the thing is if you entered this specific long trade right now you know that we are forming bearish divergence right here so potentially you can maybe look to I mean if you're going to right now close the trade you're pretty much going to close it at the break even where we are right now. We are at 90,400. So, you're literally closing the trade at break even. If you close it right now, uh if we go lower, you can get stopped out um in a loss because if you have a stop loss below the recent low exactly as on this specific picture, you are going to make a losing trade. But of course, if we do get a pump towards the upside, you are going to be in a profit. Now, the thing is looking right now at the order flow, I would say currently it looks slightly more beverish. So definitely be slightly more careful if you are right now in this specific long trade on BTC. And that is why we really need to right now talk about uh our bearish aliot wave count. Something I think I very briefly discussed in our previous live stream. But the thing is right now Bitcoin it looks like potentially actually finished our Ywave at approximately $95,000. So if right now our correction is finally finished, we can talk about like literally exact price targets of our bigger fifth Ali wave on the daily time frame. So let's right now go literally step by step. I'm going to guide you and show you exactly how to properly measure the price targets of our fifth Elliot wave if Bitcoin does right now get another push towards downside. So what we can right and do let's go with our Elliot impulsive wave right here where we are going to say okay bitcoin finished the impulse right here we got a correction another impulse right here another correction and if we do go right lower right uh lower in the upcoming uh in the upcoming days uh this right here is definitely going to be the correct ali count. I really like this specific account to be honest simply because also of one thing that I'm going to show you later on Twitter that I posted only a few hours ago. Uh but yeah, ideally this is right here something that we are right now paying attention to. There is going to be a clean fivewave price structure towards the downside. Now remember I think maybe a few live streams ago I I was talking about the timing of our fourth Elliot wave. So there is usually a very important rule uh we should follow. The fourth Elliot wave usually takes a longer time to develop versus this the second elite wave. So what we can write and do let's measure with Fibonacci time the entire length of our second alit wave and put and and compare it to the fourth ali wave."

The fourth Elliot wave usually takes a longer time to develop versus this the second elite wave. So what we can write and do let's measure with Fibonacci time the entire length of our second alit wave and put and and compare it to the fourth ali wave. So clearly you can write and notice we are definitely surpassing the 1:1 Fibonacci time level and we are even surpassing the 2:1 Fibonacci time level which if you look like that it is completely uh valid at least uh at least as of right now. So in terms of timing of our second and fourth Elliot wave, I would still say it looks valid. And also right now we need to talk about how does the correction in our fourth Elliot wave actually looks like because there is also another very simple rule we can stick to and it's going to be that the fourth aliot wave usually should not go past the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level of the entire third Ali wave. So what does it mean? You go from the high here, from the start of the third one, pushing this one towards the third all wave. Uh, and I do have the presets right here set for the fourth all wave where you can write a notice. We hit our 0.3282 382 Fibonacci retracement level. I'm not even joking almost to the exact dollar accuracy. If you are going to go with the logarithmic scale, no, unfortunately the 0.32 was not respected that nicely, but it really does look like without the logarithmic scale, uh 0.32, you be the judge. But in my opinion, it was hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy, literally exactly after we took the liquidity above the recent high. Now in comparison to the second allit wave the second one usually should go to at least 0.5 if not even deeper um towards our gold fibonage ratio or maybe even 0.786. So u when we go right now from the high back towards the low clearly you can write a notice we hit if we go with um uh second all faith we hit almost the gold fibonach ratio. If you're going to go with a logarithmic scale, you could say we potentially tapped the gold Fibonacci ratio almost to the exact dollar accuracy and then Bitcoin got equal back down. But the thing is it looks like all of the rules right now for this specific bearish Elliot wave count are right now still I would say intact are actually very nicely respected. Uh so I would say if we write on continue lower, we could be expecting the fifth Elliot wave literally in the upcoming days. So if this right here is actually true, lower targets are right now slightly more um slightly more likely on BTC. That being said, if we are right now going to start losing our support levels, we are going to talk about slightly later. Be ready for targets literally below $80,000. So what can right now be the exact target of our fifth Aliot wave? What we can do? There are three ways ways to measure the target of the fifth aliot wave. So right now let's talk about literally to the exact dollar accuracy targets. We go first of all with Fibonacci extension. There is a very simple rule. One, the first Ali wave is usually the same size as our fifth alien wave. So how can we know that? We go with our Fibonacci um trendbased Fibonacci extension. We measure the entire length of the first impulse right here. Putting the third pivot of the Fibonacci extension at the start of the fifth Ali wave. Of course, if we right now actually topped out at this specific level. Let's go with our one to one. You can notice that the target, bro. This target is a beautiful one because it's going to be exactly below our recent low $70,700. Beautiful target. If Bitcoin right to discontinue lower, um we take the liquidity below this low. We take the liquidity below this low."

This target is a beautiful one because it's going to be exactly below our recent low $70,700. Beautiful target. If Bitcoin right to discontinue lower, um we take the liquidity below this low. We take the liquidity below this low. Crypto fear and greed index probably is going to of course also get another major push down. Ideally, we are going to go in the extreme fear area similarly as we got right here for some kind of a double bottom pattern. Uh, and if this right here is going to happen, I am definitely looking to buy even more. And also, I'm going to look and scale all of my trading bots right here significantly up. At least as of right now, I have 25K in the Ethereum bot and also 25K uh in the Bitcoin bot. Yes, right here it does say actual investment 15,000. But the thing is I am using extra margin uh of 10K right here. So it's 25K plus 25K uh so it's 50K. Ideally I want to scale those bots uh those bots up even more. So we are going to see what we can do once Bitcoin potentially of course does go lower because it is also very important where you are deploying those bots. Ideally you want to be deploying them on the dip down. However, even if you deploy them where we are right now um yeah you are still going to be buying the dip because both of the bots right here are set up for Bitcoin for example. it is buying all the way down towards 65K. The Ethereum bot is buying all the way down towards $2,000. So, both of the bots are set up so they are going to be buying the dip for you in a case we are right going to get a major push down and you're already using them. Of course, you are going to go in a slight draw down if you deploy them right now uh in a case Bitcoin drops. But the thing is those bots right here are deployed for a longer period of time. I don't really want to close them right now. In terms of my manual trades, definitely I'm going to get stopped out. But the thing is, manual trades are something completely different than the trading bots. I am approaching the trading bots slightly more passively. I'm not actively managing them. I'm just letting the profits uh go into those bots because you're clearly going to see the great profit of the Ethereum and also the Bitcoin bot right here is quite nice, I would say. So, this right here, passive income, my manual trades are would I would say are more manual income, let's just say. But the thing is if we go lower 70 70k right here, I'm looking to buy the dip. I'm going to be longing Bitcoin probably also Ethereum, XRP, many different altcoins. The trading bots right here are going to be buying the dip. And also again, I'm going to be scaling them up even more. So the thing is 70K right here, uh $7,700 is our one to1. If you go with the logorithmic scale, the target is going to be slightly higher. Ideally, I'm also looking for Bitcoin to take out this specific low right here at $73,800. Also, right now, there is another way to measure the target of the fifth Ali wave. And it is going to be we go from the high here back towards the low. So, we are literally measuring the entire push down here, the first one and the third one combined. And we go right here with the third pivot of being the start of the fifth Ali wave once again. And we go with the 0.618. So, we are going to go with this one. You can notice it is going to come in at approximately $66,500. Again, below the recent low. If you go with the logarithmic scale, the targets are going to be slightly higher."

If you go with the logarithmic scale, the targets are going to be slightly higher. But the thing is, in my opinion right now, of course, the most important, not in my opinion. The rule is we ideally go below this specific low. But in my opinion, it is even better if we take even more liquidity and go even below this specific low at approximately $75,000. If those levels right here are going to get hit, beautiful. Now also the third way to measure the target of the fifth ali wave is going to be not with trendbased Fibonacci extension right here but actually with Fibonacci retracement. We are going to go and measure the entire fourth ali wave with Fibonacci ex um Fibonacci expansion levels and we are going to go right here with the expansion preset. So you can write you can right here see the first target is going to be 1.236 and the second one 1.618 2618 and then also the third one is going to be the 2:1 Fibonacci Fibonacci expansion level. So those three targets actually I'm going to right now remove some of the unnecessary ones. I'm going to go without those ones. Uh yeah, those three targets right here are in my opinion the most important ones. Uh again you can see 1.236 literally slightly below the risk low. But the other twos are perfectly aligning also with the one to one and also with the 0.618. So if you go with a logarithmic scale, you're also going to see perfect alignment right here. So I really like the targets. If Bitcoin does continue lower right here because both those three Fibonacci extension and also expansion levels are beautifully aligning, we are also going to know liquidity below our recent lows right here are going to get taken. And also remember our high-term time frame levels I have been mentioning for the past few days, the daily and also the weekly level. both of those right here. Actually, let's just uh let's just have uh let's just have this one. Uh let's remove all of other ones. I just want to see this one is the bottom one. Okay, so we are going to remove all of the other ones. I'm going to go only with those two. You can also see perfectly aligning with our Fibonacci extension levels. I mean, not perfectly to the exact dollar accuracy, but definitely at the same region. If you go with without the logarithmic scale, those high-term bip levels are definitely going to be slightly higher in comparison to our onetoone for example or in comparison to our 0.6.8. But the thing is they are definitely still going to be below the recent low. Ideally, we take uh we take this specific low and also this specific low simply because look right now at the post. I think I was already sharing you uh showing you this uh a few videos ago, but the thing is uh this post right here, Bitcoin swapped the lows during previous corrections this cycle before moving higher. Have we gotten this uh right now with this current push down? You be the judge, but in my opinion, not really. Uh so clearly, you can right here see swap the low, pump it up. Swap the low, pump it up. Swap the low right here, pump it up. Swap the low right here. I mean I mean in terms of this specific theory, not even looking at the ali waves, not looking at any crazy theories, not looking at any support resistance. Logically thinking, if we take potentially the low right here, beautiful targets are going to get hit. Um and yeah, I I mean I am definitely going to look to fire a brand new long trade right here, a massive one. Uh because then ideally we are looking for quite a strong bounce back towards the upside uh on BTC."

Uh because then ideally we are looking for quite a strong bounce back towards the upside uh on BTC. Ideally, of course, crypto fear and great index is going to drop in the extreme fear area is going to be in the red right here. Everyone's scared. We are also going to be paying attention to the liquidations because more people of course what I'm going to write and say maybe um maybe is going to sound slightly harsh uh slightly um how would I say slightly bad. But the thing is more people get wrecked, more people lose money, more people are scared, the better it is for us to fire a very good long trade on Bitcoin. of course if this scenario is even going to play out. The thing is I pretty much know almost exactly as you right now I don't know if we go down or if we go up. I don't know that. But the thing is if we hit the level I know exactly where I'm going to be looking for brand new buy trades. So the thing is you probably also know you probably also know that you don't know in which direction we are going to go. And maybe right now some of you in the chat right here are going to say to me bro you're right now saying you don't know anything. You don't know if we go up or if we don't go if we go down. The thing is you don't have to know in which direction Bitcoin moves next for you to make money in the market. The most important thing is you need to know at what level are you prepared to buy, at what level are you prepared to sell. And I'm saying to you if we go lower, I'm looking for brand new buying positions at the area of support. The thing is I made right now my entire plan. All I have to do right now is to set an alert below the recent lows. I know what I'm going to be doing right here. And if the level is hit, I'm simply going to be buying the dip. Bro, this even rhymes. If it's going to be hit, I'm simply going to be buying the dip. So, beautiful area. If Bitcoin right now does actually go even lower according to the liquidity theory right here, also FOMO meter right here. I don't know what account this is right here, but the thing is they're also saying assume every um assume every sweep is a gift and you become fuel. Liquidity hunts bleed liquidity hunts bleed out anyone trading less cycle patterns. So usually sweep the lows then rips classic cycle behavior. Of course ideally we are going to get that in the upcoming days here. Uh if not if this right here is not going to be a gift and we pump I mean if we pump much higher towards the upside my my trading bots right here both of them are long trading bots so I am going to be in an even bigger profit also my manual trades on Bitcoin uh and also um XRP long trades they are going to be in an even bigger profit so the thing is with current market conditions it's if you if you are in a position that you cannot lose this is of course also going to be the best thing uh and right Now it is up to the market to decide if it's going to give us this specific gift. Is the support area right here going to get hit? Are we actually going to be offered uh a beautiful buying opportunity exactly below the recent lows. Now let me also share with you something very very important because the thing is retail traders maybe also some of you right here in the chat really like um trading patterns."

Now let me also share with you something very very important because the thing is retail traders maybe also some of you right here in the chat really like um trading patterns. I'm just right now curious in the chat right here if you can just type very very quickly. Do you like trading patterns? Do you like going with a breakout of the I don't know ascending triangle, descending triangle, rising wedge pattern, uh falling wedge pattern, head and shoulders pattern, whatever pattern you're paying attention to. Do you actually like trading patterns? Uh or should I even say, yeah, exactly right here. Do you like trading breakouts? Because the thing is a lot of people maybe if you're watching this specific channel because I know I have been telling you many many times I don't like trading patterns but the thing is a lot of people trust me like trading patterns. Now make this make sense. I'm going to write or share with you a beautiful example because I really I really don't like trading pattern or not patterns. Yeah patterns and also breakouts on the daily time frame right here. What can we write and see? Okay, we are forming some kind of higher lows on Bitcoin right now. You can literally beautifully connect higher lows that are being formed on the daily time frame with our highs. They look very very um very very I would say equal highs, right? One, two, three equal highs. What is this? I'm sure a lot of you are going to say this right here is actually the ascending triangle with a higher probability of breaking towards the upside. But of course, if it breaks down, I'm going to look for a short trade at this specific area. Now, in my opinion, why I don't like trading breakdowns, breakouts, whatever. You go lower right here, we start breaking the area of, let's just say $88,000. Look at this. It is the high term time frame support level, weekly and the daily. Exactly right here. So, if we get lower right here, we start breaking down, you go with a short trade exactly at the support. Not saying we cannot break the support level and go even lower. Sure, of course we can. Uh especially if we are right now paying attention to our uh fivewave price structure back down. But the thing is you are shorting selling exactly at the area of support. Wouldn't it be more logical better to go with a short trade at the area of resistance? In my opinion, it is much better for you to look for sell trades at the area of resistance, buy trades at the area of support. I'm not saying I'm going to be buying right here because the thing is I am already in a long trade on BTC and I'm actually going to get stopped out. If we are going to start breaking those support levels right here, I am maybe even going to get stopped out of my long trade. But the thing is I do remain in my short trade on Bitcoin and also on Ethereum. But the thing is logically in my opinion of course I'm not saying it's the correct one but the thing is I much rather fire a short trade once we are getting a push up. People are bullish here, expecting a breakout, liquidity grap right here, dump it back down at the support level. Everyone is scared, wrecked, and also they are maybe even firing short trades because yeah, of course they are scared. Bitcoin is probably going to move lower. But then of course we get a reversal, we get a bounce towards the upside at the area of support. So logically, it is much better in my opinion again to go with another long trade. So that is why if Bitcoin right now is going to for example going to break out out of the triangle, I'm not going to do anything. I'm not firing any any new long trades."

So that is why if Bitcoin right now is going to for example going to break out out of the triangle, I'm not going to do anything. I'm not firing any any new long trades. Not any short trades. Of course, I'm going to look for a short trade at the area of resistance, but it is going to be slightly higher above our triangle. I'm not directly going to trade the the short trade out of the triangle right here. And also, if even if we go lower, I'm not going to do anything. I'm going to look at the chart right here and simply identify where is the best support level for me to buy, where is the best resistance level for me to sell. Again, usually the best strategy is buy low and sell high. If you are going to be selling here, are you actually selling high or are you selling low? I mean, in this scenario, one could say you are going to be selling. Of course, if we then continue lower, you could be selling at a good point. But this is not my point right here. The point is once we get a push up, usually you're looking for sells. Usually when we get a push down, you're trying to buy low and sell high. This is the name of the game. Doesn't doesn't mean every trade is going to play out. But the most important thing is try to buy low, try to sell high. And if you're going to have good riskto-reward ratio trades, uh smart stop-loss placement, I do think over a longer period of time, you are probably going to be profitable. Also right here with this specific trade as I said before to you if we go lower right here you can get stopped out or also right now if you know that we are right now forming this uh slight bearish absorption potentially you can already close this specific trade again it could play out or maybe it is not going to play out but the most important thing is risk management and again you're buying on the move down right here you're buying at the support potentially selling once we get a push towards the upside this right here is the most important thing so that is right why I would also really appreciate if you right now smash up the like button in the chat right here. Also, if you want, you can subscribe to the channel. But also, right now, I want to share with you something very, very important in terms of where is going to be our first local area of support. Because the reality is if Bitcoin right now does go lower, where we do have some very nice local support levels where potentially we can still get some kind of a bounce, maybe even our triangle right here is going to get a breakout towards the upside. Again, as I said before to you, I don't know up, down. I know what is my next key level and where we can potentially be looking for another trade. So the thing is right here when we are zooming in on the 1 hourly for example what are the most important uh levels usually uh on the entire chart. If you go with this one literally you don't have to pay attention to any other level but the liquidity levels. So if you can properly identify liquidity levels, you're going to be um uh you are going to be ahead of 99% of people. You can literally see right here almost every single time before a bigger move, we get a liquidity grab here below the recent lows. Liquidity grab, pump it up. Liquidity grab right here. Pump it up. Liquidity grab right here. Pump it up. Yes, I would say with this specific structure right here, we did not take the high right here before this quite a deep uh quite a deep rejection."

If you go with this one literally you don't have to pay attention to any other level but the liquidity levels. So if you can properly identify liquidity levels, you're going to be um uh you are going to be ahead of 99% of people. You can literally see right here almost every single time before a bigger move, we get a liquidity grab here below the recent lows. Liquidity grab, pump it up. Liquidity grab right here. Pump it up. Liquidity grab right here. Pump it up. Yes, I would say with this specific structure right here, we did not take the high right here before this quite a deep uh quite a deep rejection. But the thing is here liquidity grab above the high dump it down. Also right here we got not only one but two liquidity grabs. Take the liquidity dump it. Take the liquidity dump it right here. So clearly this look like liquidity levels work like magic. And that is why what is right and going to be the first liquidity level you should right be aware on BTC. remember our previous video where we talked about our horizontal range and I would still say right now to you our range right here it is a very oops not like this um it is a very important um very important structure you should really pay attention because locally speaking on the 1 hourly we do have liquidity levels below our recent lows and what you can write to see also bro even this push towards the upside what we said it is a very important liquidity level I'm not making things up bro we usually want to pay attention to the liquidity levels right here. This was a perfect rejection on Bitcoin. And I know I mean I posted this specific level before it was hit. Happy days for Bitcoin if this level gets reclaimed. Of course, it was not reclaimed or it has not been reclaimed, should I say. Uh but the thing is liquidity level above the wrist high, not only one. First low, I mean first high, second high, third high, fourth high. Four liquidity levels aligning with the anchored VWAP. Perfect heat push towards downside. Some kind of a rejection. Where does Bitcoin right on this have another very important liquidity area? Not knowing about the range, only looking at the structure, only looking at the price action. Where is going to be our next important liquidity level? Of course, one could say exactly below the recent low. And you are going to be correct. This specific level is our liquidity level. And bro, bro, look at this. Before we got any push up, liquidity below the low taken, pump it back towards the upside. liquidity above the high taken push it back down. So those liquidity levels work wonders and you can also right here see this is right now going to be our fresh liquidity level. Another one this level right here another low also right here another low we are forming those higher lows which is actually beautiful and also right here another low. So one could say 1 2 3 four liquidity levels in a row if Bitcoin run does continue even lower back towards side. So those liquidity levels are going to be very important for us to pay attention to because potentially we hit the bottom of our horizontal range. We grab the liquidity below the recent low. If there is a reaction back towards the upside, we can still be looking for some kind of a long trade. The problem is going to happen if our range right here is going to start breaking back down. Because if we start breaking the range right here back towards the upside, quite a bad indication for Bitcoin. And in this scenario, we are going to then again pay attention to our bigger fivewave price structure towards downside below the area of approximately $75,000 US. Now also not only our liquidity levels are going to be literally below our recent lows, but also pay attention to the liquidation heat map on the two week not only below this specific low right here, but also much much lower actually below those lows right here."

Now also not only our liquidity levels are going to be literally below our recent lows, but also pay attention to the liquidation heat map on the two week not only below this specific low right here, but also much much lower actually below those lows right here. So even if Bitcoin actually this is also one very important thing why ideally I'm looking for something like this not something like this for something uh for something like uh this right here for Bitcoin to take the liquidity below the bigger low right here below $80,000 simply because we still have so much liquidity uh that hasn't been taken below the lows here one low second low third low fourth low all of those lows right here you can also say right here another low so so much liquidity below the recent lows and all of those lows right here are acting as a magnet for BTC. That is why ideally I am actually looking right here for a bigger push down for us to finish the bigger fivewave price structure towards downside. Now one could already maybe I mean maybe this is usually what happens on YouTube right I talk about a bullish and bearish scenario and then someone is going to say to me bro you were wrong. The thing is how can I be wrong if I show you a bullish and also a bearish scenario. The thing is, I'm simply going to adapt. I'm going to trade accordingly. What if Bitcoin does right now get a major push towards the upside, major pump? What is this scenario going to look like? The thing is, I don't know. Up, down. I know at what level, I'm prepared to make another trade. If we go lower below the recent lows, I'm simply going to look for buys. Nothing spectacular, right? If we go higher, I'm going to be more interested to find another short trade. So in this scenario, if you are in my free free VIP Discord server, you probably know. But the thing is, you can see right here, this is one of the scenarios I'm right now still paying attention to in a case Bitcoin does continue higher golden featur, $97,000 area aligning surprisingly or maybe not with the liquidity level above the recent high. this level a very important one if we are going to get another push towards the upside uh because it is definitely going to be quite a significant area of resistance on Bitcoin uh where of course we can potentially be looking for another uh short trade right here. So the thing is I can the like with my plan right here I'm going to know exactly what I'm going to be doing if we go up or if we go down. So if you write a commenting or actually a lot of people are commenting under my videos you were um of course I do get comments you are the best always stop stuff like that right but the thing is some people say bro you are completely wrong and the thing is if we get a push up towards the gold Fibonacci ratio I'm going to look for a short trade if we go down below the below the below the support area right here right below the recent low I'm going to look for a long trade I'm not saying the trades are going to play But the thing is I know exactly where I'm buying, where I'm selling. So right now, if Bitcoin is going to chop around this specific level for the next few weeks, maybe even also if you look like that, bro, the trading bots right here are almost built for that because the reality is they are constantly buying. They're constantly selling. And in no way I would be able to trade so well at this specific uh range right here, range bound environment as well as the trading bots right here. They are constantly buying and selling."

They are constantly buying and selling. If we get even a small push towards downside, for example, on Bitcoin on the move up right here, they were selling every few%. When we get a push down, they are buying the dip. They are constantly buying and selling. So those trading bots in our current environment that we are right here seeing on Bitcoin, they are really working very very nicely. So as we said before, we have made approximately in the past 51 days. Um yeah I mean if you look like that it has been uh it has been 1 month and 21 days and we have made um yeah you can right here see uh 10 11.2% uh profit. So nothing spectacular but the thing is it's passive income. So this right here in my opinion in current market conditions even if we go lower they are going to be buying the dip. Yes, you can lose money if for example we are going to go much lower. But the thing is in my opinion it is still better because you're going to be buying the dip on Bitcoin on Ethereum all the way down towards 65K all the way down towards $2,000. Uh so yeah this is exactly what I'm right now uh doing with my trades. I am in a long I'm in a short. I have taken the profits uh on both of the trades uh on both long and short. Right now I'm simply waiting for Bitcoin to decide in which direction we are going to go. If we trade uh in this range for the next one month, two months, the trading bots are going to do uh all the heavy lifting. Of course, if you want to use the bots, you can use them completely for free. Sign up on Pionex, you'll get only after you register 50 USD, then deposit. You're going to get a beautiful deposit bonus right here and then copy the bots using this specific link down below uh in the description. Also, right now, of course, if you're down here, smash up the like button, subscribe to the channel. Um and right now actually I also want to go through Ethereum and also through uh XRP. I just want to right here see uh the chat a little bit to see exactly what you are saying. Um how possible is Bitcoin reaching 92,000 before a big push down or you think it is going to be just down. Um, in terms of likelihood like the thing is right now if we start lo pretty much as I said before to you if we start losing the horizontal range right here the bottom of the range I would say lower targets are definitely going to be more likely and in this scenario we can potentially already talk about like the bigger fiveway price structure towards downside for us to finish the bigger uh fifth all wave. So right now for us to go uh as you're saying right here for us to actually go all the way down towards 92 all the way uh up towards 92,000 it is possible um but for us to do that if we reclaim the top of the range right here 92,000 I do think it's going to be quite a bullish indication in this scenario we are going to look for this gold Fibonacci ratio here so for us to go right now towards 92,000 sure of course it is possible uh but yeah we are definitely right going to see What is going to happen? First of all, in the range right here, I'm not really trading actively this specific range. The bots are doing the heavy lifting for me right here. So, right now, right now, what is happening right here? I don't really trade this specific scenarios."

So, let's see what happens right here. Uh, but the thing is, uh, in terms of probabilities, very hard to say. Uh, Devin Hood, welcome to the stream. Hyper, you are a true trader. Much love, my friend. Uh, cheers to Dein Devin Hood right here. Thank you very much for joining today's cryptocurrency live stream. Really appreciate you, man, because you have been here for a very long time, which of course I really appreciate once again. So yeah, thank you. Um, okay, let's see. Um, I don't believe it's only down because all thief in crypto. Oh, you're saying right here, mafia in crypto, they are going to manipulate the price. Uh, we are going to see a major dump. Like, bro, if you would say if you would actually say this right here, maybe at the alltime high, which I do think maybe even some people were saying, bro, Bitcoin cannot go down. Bro, look at this right now. What I'm going to show you, every single correction, if you go on the daily, has gotten a major uh a major push down. If you look like that, let's go on the weekly. Let's go with the logarithmic scale. This push down right here, 73%. This push down right here, 77%. what we are getting right now it is let's just see approximately 35 so nothing major if you look like that right I do think we can drop lower um first of all of course I would be expecting a bigger bounce here uh but the thing is every single correction 75 let's just say percent push down so for you to say right now we cannot go down because all of the thieves are right now in Bitcoin I don't think um this is true and I do think a bigger correction can definitely happen in the cryptocurrency market entire crypto market uh also including Ethereum, XRP, whatever. Uh but the thing is if we go down simply you can be buying even more. So it would be even better if you look at that, right? Um can you tell us the targets where to get in for XRP in a long trade if Bitcoin goes down, please? And thank I'm going to talk about XRP in a moment, bro. So definitely. Uh Devin Hood, uh we miss your live streams, man. Great to catch you live. Thank you very much, man. I mean, really nice to see you here. Cryptog, I'm from Pakistan. Cheers to Pakistan right now. Uh, let's see. How possible. Oh, no. We already read this one. Bitcoin was the most sinister asset to trade in 2025. It did the total opposite of what it should have done. Anyway, I'm I'm cautious this year, not believing the hype anymore. Thanks for repilian bankers. Um, I mean, this year I do think it can be more of a bearish year definitely."

Thanks for repilian bankers. Um, I mean, this year I do think it can be more of a bearish year definitely. uh but yeah we are going to go and move with the price let's just say we can have a bullish bearish scenario but the thing is the more data we are going to have uh the the more the better prediction we can make right so that is why I don't really want to make right now any crazy assumptions any crazy predictions I'm just right now focusing of what I think is going to happen in the upcoming days right here once we hit our levels we can then of course uh evaluate um the price action again the thing is what if we go lower and we don't get a bounce here what if I'm just saying maybe it's not going to play out as I'm right saying to you right so that is why what if we I don't know dump towards 50,000 immediately in this scenario you should also get prepared stop loss is set uh because in the case we go that low of course um it would be definitely very very bad but the the main scenario right now in my opinion the highest likely scenario is still going to be this one looking for another push down potentially the fourth one can go of course again towards the gold fibonite ratio if not um we of course already topped out at this specific area and we are right already looking for another major push down here. Also, let's talk about Ethereum because Ethereum right now uh of course usually it is always following Bitcoin. If you are in my free VIP Discord group, bro, I talked about one level and one level only for Ethereum. Of course, I was mentioning also some other levels, but the thing is this level right here, just a reminder about this support level on Ethereum. It's a really nice level. If heat, bro, I'm not making things up, but this level right here, approximately 2,5004300 US area below the recent low, a beautiful a beautiful support level for ETH. So, what you're going to see right here, you go actually we don't even have to uh we go with this one. We have not this one uh actually this one without logarithmic scale. Golden Pocket Anchor VWAP fixed range volume profile measuring the entire upper price action since February 2022. So we are looking at the price action which is almost four years uh four years long if you look at that right point of control anchored VWAP golden Fibonacci ratio $2500ish US bro I'm telling to you if we start going lower if Ethereum hits the level right here Bitcoin also hits the support level right here approximately 75k uh 70,000 maybe even something like this on Bitcoin bam bam Ethereum ideally bam bam this is what I'm paying attention to right here on ETH because beautiful support this is bro this is the only thing I'm going to write and say for ETH this support level is a beautiful support level right here 2400 you you can actually see right here I do have an alert set right here if we are right I'm going to go lower but the thing is if it's going to get hit I'm definitely not going to be waiting for a long time I'm going to definitely be looking to buy the dip right here so Yeah, both Ethereum and also Bitcoin right here do have beautiful support areas. Um, in terms of the Ali count, I don't have it right here on ETH, but definitely we can also then talk about some kind of a finished uh fiveway price structure. One, ABC right here. Two, uh, three, some kind of the fourth one right here and then the fifth one. Something like this, I would say."

But the most important thing is if the level is hit, I don't care about the Elliot wave right here. I don't care about anything. Beautiful support level trying to buy low. looking for buys right here. Ideally also again the crypto fear and grid index hits the extreme fear area bro this level for ETH a beautiful technical price target not saying it's going to hold because what if the level gets broken we dump I don't know towards $1,000 but I'm knowing right now it's a nice level I have a plan I know where I'm going to be buying and also if you're then going to be setting the stop loss below the support level definitely uh you are then going to have uh some kind of a proper risk management let's just say because you have a plan you have the execution once we hit the level you have the stop loss placement proper position size let's see if then we can of course uh get a bigger bounce but this level for ETH beautiful level XRP for XRP like bro look at this on the daily you can actually go with only one thing and it's going to be a horizontal range look how nicely this horizontal range let me go into today has been respected here like support level I mean of course this time we still hasn't haven't formed the range right here but you got one pivot second pivot top of the range push down. Bottom of the range, I mean, it wasn't perfectly respected, but we got a strong bounce towards the upside. And bro, bro, bro, pay attention to this. What level do you think we got a rejection right here? I can, bro, I'm going to right now give you um one question here. What is the most important or actually at what Fibonacci level you think XRP got a rejection uh only a few days ago at the area of let's just say $2.4? Please write right now in the chat at what Fibonacci level you think we got a rejection on XRP only a few days ago right here at $2.4. Um I'm just curious right now. Yeah. Okay. I do see right here a lot of people are right now commenting. 0.76. Nope. Incorrect. Uh bro, you the bro. Happy Sunday. Happy Sunday to let's see what happens. 814 to you as well. golden ratio 665 um yeah golden pocket exactly as you said guys 0.618 and 0.65 are usually the most important Fibonacci levels I mean technically it is 0.618 618. But look right on this Fibonacci retracement from the high towards the low. Look at the power of the golden Fibonacci ratio. And we are right now also using the gold Fibonacci ratio on a bigger scale right here on the 2-day time frame as well on um on Ethereum. So this right here major Fibonacci ratio, major gold pocket also right here for our uh upper target for Bitcoin right here. As we said before also I'm looking for the gold batch ratio because usually it is beautifully respected. Not saying it is going to be this time but usually it is nicely respected. So XRP hit the gold pocket right here and we got a rejection back down but it wasn't only the gold pocket here. Bro look at this major horizontal range. You go with fixed range volume profile measuring actually let me go on the daily measure the entire range. What are usually this is literally everything that I'm right showing to you I'm showing also you you to you usually on Bitcoin Ethereum and also right now on XRP is being is working beautifully measuring the range with the volume. Why? Because usually the volume levels are the most important levels in the range."

Why? Because usually the volume levels are the most important levels in the range. So you can see bro look at this. I'm not even joking. Zoom in on the daily point of control. The biggest volume cluster hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy aligning with the gold pocket and we are right now experiencing a rejection back down of approximately 14.16%. So this level, beautiful level that was hit only a few days ago and right now XRP is getting a rejection. I did not short XRP. I did short Ethereum. I did short Bitcoin. So right now with this push down, what is right now going to be our best level for us to trade. Now when you measure like this specific week is actually quite um quite hard to actually use. But the thing is I'm still going to use it because uh because it was actually still the exact low. So let's use the low here. Let's measure the entire bounce. What do you think I'm going to say to you is right now the most important level for XRP. Again, maybe you guessed it, maybe not. The golden Fibonacci ratio if you go with the logarithmic scale it is going to be lower and in my opinion the lower one is better one because um the thing is Bitcoin if you look like that if you if we just take out the low right here it is going to literally be done then immediately the gold Fibonacci ratio and it also means if Bitcoin starts taking the low right here we could potentially go even lower and take also the low at this specific area. This is why potentially if Bitcoin does right now go even lower probably XRP is also going to go even lower. So that is why I'm going to be paying attention to this gold pocket or we can also say once Bitcoin is below this low or ideally this low once Ethereum is at the gold Fibonacc ratio at $2,400. Let's just say we can also then be looking for long trades on XRP. This in my opinion is the ideal scenario. Hit the G pocket, hit the bottom of the range, pump it towards the upside. I don't know if it's going to happen. This right here is only my plan. But if it does happen, I mean, it is going to definitely be a beautiful thing. So, very nice support levels right here for XRP, for Ethereum, for Bitcoin. Let's right now just be slightly more patient and let's just actually see uh if what I'm showing you right here, right now, it is actually going to play out. If it doesn't play out, we go higher. I mean, we still do have then the gold fibonite ratio here where we can be looking for a potential uh short trade uh on BTC. uh in this scenario of course I am going to get stopped out of my already opened uh short trade but yeah this is just the the part of the game if you look at that right so let's see um I don't trade forex market nice bro thank you very much uh what's happening next for XRP lower pretty much yeah if Bitcoin does go lower I do think XRP is going to uh follow your bots make up for your last set not sure exactly what you mean with this one but the thing is if we go lower the bots are going to be buying uh the depth.

If you enjoyed it, of course, uh I would appreciate for you to smash up the like. If not, see you maybe next week uh again on another cryptocurrency live stream. But until then, definitely I really do hope you are you are going to enjoy the entire upcoming week. Hopefully, of course, we are going to be able to make some very nice money with our trades in the upcoming week. But with it being said, thank you for watching everyone. See you next time and of course peace out. [music] >> Impressed happy and clapping is impressed. [music] Eanic [music] clapping clapping clapping clapping. Yeah. Yeah. [music]"
