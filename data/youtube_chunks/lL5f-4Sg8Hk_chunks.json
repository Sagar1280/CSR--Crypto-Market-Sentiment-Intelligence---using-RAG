      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the macroverse. Today we're going to be talking about a very important chart, specifically the stock market, the S&P 500 on its valuation against gold. And we're going to talk about what this chart means, what it has historically meant. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and check out Into the Cryptoverse Premium at into the cryptoverse.com as well. If you do want to re reach out for any inquiries, you can always check out the new website at bjamincan.com if this is something you're interested in. Now, what I want to do is go through this chart. Now, you'll have to forgive me for the somewhat clickbait title. I didn't really know what to call it, but I do want people to look at the chart. I I I do think this is a really important one, and we've been following it here at ITC for a while. Um, and it looks like it's in danger of potentially breaking down. And so I I just want to kind of cover where this is. If you draw a line, which I guess is already on here, but if we if we put a line right where the current valuation is across the screen, you can see the relevance of the stock market's valuation against gold at this level. This is actually the level that the stock market was rejected at that led into the Great Depression in 1929, right? It went up to this level and then crashed. But I don't really think we're there. Like that's not where I think we are. We're we're we've been above it for a little while. You'll notice that we were at this same level in the 1970s and 1960s. Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, the stock market often would sort of bounce around these levels. But then once it broke down, it led to a very uh you know, a fairly large regime shift in the markets. What I mean by that is the stock market started to drop quickly. Now, there's this thinking that a lot of people have, and I I actually think it it's not correct. And and one of these levels of thinking is this is that people want to sell their winners to buy the losers, right? When when something's doing well, they want to go sell it and then find something that's not doing well and then they want to buy that thinking it'll rally, too. So, for instance, a lot of people have sold metals and they've bought other things. It's no, no one's denying that metals will likely have a blowoff top. I I think it's probably going to happen in the first half of this year. Okay, I'm not denying that. I don't feel like there's many people that are going to deny that. Where I think people are making a mistake is that I think a lot of people believe that when metals top that it will then lead to a rotation back to risk assets. I don't think that is the case. And the reason I say that is this. When this chart has broken down previously, it did not lead to a rotation. If you overlay the S&P 500 onto the chart, what you'll notice is that when gold when the stock market broke down against gold in 1973, the stock market then had a fairly large correction. Now, it was a 50% correction. Hopefully, we don't get that, but that is what ultimately happened back then when it broke down. A 50% drop in the stock market. when it broke down in 2008, we also had a fairly similar correction. Now, we haven't actually broken down yet, but we are getting dangerously close. Is it possible that it just simply bounces again at these levels and it all comes unraveling in another few years? The last time we were down at these levels was in 2020 when we went into a recession. Now, we printed our way out of it, and maybe we'll print our way out of it again. I I will not sit here and pretend like they aren't going to at least try to to print their problems away. But if you were to overlay, um I just put out an I just had a new indicator that I just coded up here. Um where is it? It was uh this recession. It was basically just like a recession. Here we go. This chart, the green shaded areas are prior recessions. Okay. And I, you know, you have I added this one from 1920 or sorry 1920 from 2020 as well."

This chart, the green shaded areas are prior recessions. Okay. And I, you know, you have I added this one from 1920 or sorry 1920 from 2020 as well. So you'll also notice in the 70s when it got down to these levels like in 1960 I guess not 70s but in 60 1960 we had a recession and then when we broke down below it in 1973 we had a recession going into 1974 and the stock market dropped and then it led into a recession. In 2008 we had a recession at these levels. Now we did not have a recession at these levels in 2016 but we did have a recession scare back then. In 2015 there was a lot of people worried about a recession back then. didn't actually happen. So now I look at this chart and I say it's one of the most important charts to watch because if this chart breaks down the odds of a recession actually go up a lot significantly I would say because when it happened in the 70s we had a recession. When it happened in '08 we had a recession and that's not the only reason. I mean, if you just simply look at the unemployment rate, like we can tell it's been trending higher. The only reason we haven't had a recession yet is because layoffs are still relatively low. You know, you can even look at at layoffs and discharges and see that, you know, by all many measures are still relatively low. The reason the unemployment rate's been going up is because people aren't really hiring new like people aren't really hiring. So, new people in the labor force are having a harder time finding a job. In fact, if you look at the unemployment rate for specifically say 16 to 19 year olds, that looks a lot scarier than it does for people that are older, right? The unemployment rate for 16 and 19 year olds is 15.7%. This is looking pretty bad. And if you if you change that to 20 to 24, it's at 8.2. A lot different than what it is for say 25 to 54, that's down at 3.7. What I think's happening is there's a lot of companies that are not hiring new people. I don't know why. Maybe it's because of monetary policy. Maybe because demand has dropped. Maybe because a lot of the entry-level jobs have been replaced by AI. I don't know. But the unemployment rate has been trending higher. The reason the stock market is itself is near all-time highs is because uh you can always find strength somewhere. And what I mean by that is if you look at a map of the number of of all the different US states and you know where the unemployment rate is rising compared to 6 months ago, while you do have 27 states where it's gone up over the last 6 months, that means there's 23 states where it hasn't. And in order to have a full-blown recession like you had in in say like 2008, everywhere basically needs to see the unemployment rate going up. Also, you saw the same thing in the dot recession as well, right? Like in 2001, it was every state that was experiencing it. So, as long as there's strength somewhere, the market likes to climb the wall of worry. But if the stock market were to break down against gold, there's a good chance that it would then usher in a recession. Now, it doesn't have to be terrible, right? I mean, some recessions are just like 20% drops in the stock market, and we actually had one of those last year. Even less than a year ago, we had a 20% drop. So, I don't want you to say to run with this and and pretend like we know exactly what it means because we don't. And there's always a chance that it bounces."

So, I don't want you to say to run with this and and pretend like we know exactly what it means because we don't. And there's always a chance that it bounces. But what I'm saying now is that if this starts closing below these levels, right, like it's currently at 1.45. If it starts clo and you can see in in 2020 it went down to 1.44. If this starts closing below 1.4, before then I think you have to start seriously considering a recession at that point. Now again not all recessions are created the same uh some are different than others. Some are 20% drops some are 50% drops etc. But at that point you have to start seriously start to consider it. The reason why at this point it's not as obvious, although it could certainly seem obvious in a few months, is because by many standards, I mean, the stock market just put in a new all-time high like this month, right? Like it it just put in a new all-time high. So, it it what usually leads to recessions is the stock market dropping. Okay? And of course, yes, there are some similarities between sort of the way it topped out in 2021. you had a high in November and a slightly higher high in January. And in 2025, sort of a high October and then a slightly higher high in January. In 2018 though, we still had some rallies into the early part of 2018. Um, which is why we can't just take one example. But what I'm suggesting is this. If the stock market starts to drop, and especially if gold continues to go up, then it's not going to take very long for the stock market against gold to break down. The problem is that if it closes below 1.45, let's call it on a monthly close and then gold gets a correction, there's likely a scenario where the stock market against gold does not get a mean reversion up. It could just simply continue to go down. Now, when you zoom out on this chart, one of the things I'd like to point out is there's a couple of ways to look at this, and I'm not yet sure which I which one I think is the most likely. Um, we're going to change this to a line so we can kind of see it going all the way back to uh to um 18 the 1800s. Okay. So, what you'll notice is that there's a line down here in the 1800s uh where the stock market you stock market valued against gold it would hit this ratio of of 0.2 right 0.2. Okay. Okay. And it got relatively close in, you know, after, you know, during the Great Depression, it went down to like point um 21. Okay. We also went down here in 1980. Okay. Now, in 1980, while it this looks really bad, it look it looks really, really bad, right? But in the 1980s, the stock market wasn't doing all that bad. I mean like it basically we we had we were in a lost decade but it's not like it was crashing like some great depression or anything like that. It was just going sideways for a while uh with some 50% drops. It was mostly just going sideways for a decade while gold was going up. Therefore, this this was dropping. So when I look at a chart like this, it's hard not to be bullish on gold long term, right? like it's hard not to be um because there's always a world where the valuation of the S&P against gold drops down here. Now, that doesn't have to just be because the stock market is dropping. It could be because gold is going up."

Now, that doesn't have to just be because the stock market is dropping. It could be because gold is going up. Could be any number of things, but you also have to look at sort of these this uptrend here and kind of recognize that um you know, like a lot of times when when you have these types of charts, you have to wonder like is it is it an oscillator? Is it not? And and where I get a little confused is because if these highs were at the same level, like if these highs were all right here, then I could more convincingly call it an oscillator where it comes back down. But the highs have been getting slightly higher. And if you go out long enough on this chart, the lows have been getting slightly lower. So you could even argue that this is some type of expanding wedge, like broadening expanding wedge. Um, and you know, there have been a lot of times throughout my investing career where I got like really convinced. I was like, I thought I knew it was going to happen and then something else ended up happening, right? Like, you know, is it possible that it drops down here? Absolutely. Is it also possible it rallies back up here before dropping? That could be true, too. It it's really hard to know uh exactly way it'll play out, but what I would say in the short term is a monthly close below 1.4 1.4 before. So is going to start looking pretty bad. Now where it gets interesting is, you know, do you look at a chart like this and say, well, you know, when it broke down back over here in the 80s, it was all the way down here and then it went when it broke down kind of after financial crisis, it was a higher low. Could we could we print another higher low? And and that's this is one of these things where like by the time it breaks down, you might have some people that go make a panic trade and then it just comes right back up for a little bit. So, I want you to be careful about it. For me, right now, this chart is more of a signal than anything else. This is what has kept me bullish on gold for as long as I have, right? And and gold continues to do really really well. This chart is one of the things that has kept me bullish on gold because I'm like, well, I want to put my money somewhere, you know, like I don't want just all I don't want to be 100% cash where I put it. Do I put it in crypto? Do I put it in stocks? Do I put it in metals? Metals have been a great investment over the last couple years, right? And when I look at a chart like this, like I don't just want to be 100% stocks because they're just bleeding against gold. And they've been bleeding against gold since 2021. Like in fact, it might not feel like it, but the stock market is down 46% against gold. We can sit here and a lot of people can sit around and pretend like that gold has been a bad investment, but the reality is for the last four years, you would have been better buying gold than buying the stock market. Even though there's a lot of hedge fund managers and people that run their own ETFs and funds that will never want you to believe that, especially if they don't buy things that have exposure to metals, but if they just buy things that have exposure to stocks, of course, they're going to pretend like metals are a bad investment. But they've been a really good investment for a long time."

But they've been a really good investment for a long time. And I'm not saying you need to go FOMO into silver after it's got like a monthly RSI in the '9s, but I'm saying that these charts show you why just being all in on the stock market, uh, it works over the long haul, but there still can be decades where having some metal exposure is not a bad thing. Um, and I I've been, you know, dealing with a lot of people that keep telling me that why it's been a bad time to pivot for the last few years, especially away from higher risk cryptocurrencies to lower risk things like metals because they keep thinking that the the trend's about to change and that it just keeps not changing. You know, there's no guarantee that it will. And so, if this chart breaks down, then whenever gold does have a correction, stocks likely go down, too. If this chart bounces at these levels, then perhaps you could have a rotation back and and maybe it kicks the can down the road for another few years, you know? I mean, we we came pretty close to breaking down in n in 2020 and then we printed our way out of it, right? Um, and you can see there was some close calls back over here as well. In fact, where it just sort of bounced at for a little while is where it also, you see where it sort of bounced right here for up for a little a few months, then back down. That's also kind of what happened uh in July of 1972. This one was just in in the summer of of 2025. So, if this breaks down and then gold gets a correction, what's likely going to happen is then the stock market gets a correction. And then when the stock market gets a correction, a larger correction, that's likely when layoffs could start to pick up. And then if the layoffs pick up with hiring low, with job openings low, with quits low, that's how you lead into a recession. But remember, by the time a recession is announced, the low is usually in. Okay? So, you know, I've been pretty vocal about saying that I think Bitcoin will likely find a low maybe in October. It could happen by this summer, but I I've said October a few times. And one of the reasons I've said that is because, you know, the the bare market that we had in 2016 or 2017 to 2018 um was a year December to December and then the next one was November to November and this one started in October. So maybe it's just October to October. And so maybe by October 2026 there's signs of a recession and then maybe they announce one. But then what if that's the bottom? You know, like maybe maybe that is the low. And in fact, if you were to look at at say like the the year-to- date ROI of the stock market and you just simply pull up 2026 and look at the average of prior uh midterm years, oftentimes there is a low out in like late Q3, early Q4. So, I just want people to like watch this chart, like watch the S&P divided by gold chart because I think it does have a lot of useful information in it. If if you were counting on this chart to break down to the lows back in after the financial crisis, you would have been disappointed because then the stock market took over for a while. So, I don't want you to look at it and and assume that you know what has to happen because it it could play out many different ways."

So, I don't want you to look at it and and assume that you know what has to happen because it it could play out many different ways. But in the short term, in the short term, if this breaks down below this level, then it raises the odds of layoffs starting to pick up because the implication is likely that there's a rotation of money out of stocks and into harder assets like metals for a little while and then that might spook people in the stock market, especially with all the uncertainty related to tariffs and and other things. um it it certainly could play out like that. So, watch this chart. What's interesting is that this chart was also at again the same level in March of 2020. Same president, right, was in office in the United States, right? The same president was in office. And honestly, back then, you could have looked at this chart and and come to similar conclusions and said, \"Oh, well, looks like it's about to break down.\" and then the Fed came out, printed $6 trillion and dropped interest rates to zero and then everything changed, right? So that's the difficult thing with markets is that, you know, things can change quickly. If the Fed were to come out in a month and say, \"Hey, we're going to turn the money printers back on and, oh, we're also going to drop interest rates to zero,\" then the assessment, the outlook changes. But if rates stay the way they are and and you know we don't really see any any meaningful changes with anything then it seems like this would be the sort of the more likely outcome. So uh maybe add this chart uh to the to the charts that you watch. Keep an eye on it. It's currently at 1.44. And by the way, this is the level it found a low at uh in in 2020. And and so I I just want people to to keep an eye on this in the coming months because I think it actually provides a pretty great signal for how you might want to navigate financial markets.
