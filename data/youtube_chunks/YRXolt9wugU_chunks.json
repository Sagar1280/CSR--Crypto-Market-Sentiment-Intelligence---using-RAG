      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse. Today we're going to talk about Ethereum dubious speculation. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and also check out into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse.com. Ethereum has started off 2026. Okay, it's currently up about 8% or so. The hard part now is sort of reconciling. Are we here? If this is sort of that 2019 comparison, which is what I feel like makes the most amount of sense. If you do think we're here, that doesn't necessarily mean that Ethereum is capped at a at a lower high. It always depends on what the ETH Bitcoin valuation does. As we've talked before about, you know, the ETH Bitcoin valuation and and what what it would have to do in order for Ethereum to go back up near the highs, it would need to actually start showing strength. Even on a macro lower high by Bitcoin, it's always possible Ethereum could go back up to those highs. The the hard part right now is that we've had this drop and Ethereum's Bitcoin valuation is still I mean it's trying to get through the bull market, but it hasn't really been able to do so just yet, right? Um we do know that when quantitative tightening uh ended last cycle in 2019, it did lead to a shortterm push by the ETH Bitcoin valuation. Right? So quantitative tightening has ended. You can see the balance sheet of the Fed has started to go up. Um, so if you if you look at that precisely, you can see that ETH Bitcoin went up to the bull market and then came back down and then it really started to go up more. So I I don't want to jump to any conclusions right now. I think the hard part with Ethereum is that, you know, it didn't really get that larger blowoff top like Bitcoin. So it still leaves like something to be desired in terms of the overall bull market. Uh but the the hard part though is that you're still running into the the potential foyer cycle aspect of you know this is normally when Ethereum starts to go down. And so on one hand you have people saying well without euphoria how can it be a top and on the other hand you have people saying well this is the midterm year wouldn't you expect these rallies to the bull market sport band to just get rejected? That's the hard part um as it relates to Ethereum. What I think uh right now is that this is kind of the window for Ethereum to prove itself if it is going to get above the bull market square. Like it's now or never because if it can't do it in the next month or two, then I I think that you know, you kind of have the writing on the wall and therefore it would likely trend back down um into the regression band as we get sort of deeper into 2026. And then you're basically just kind of witnessing the same thing that we had in 2019 where we slowly bled down uh back into the regression. There's actually a really great chart for that. If you look at um the logarithmic regression chart for Ethereum and you look at the price divided by the non-bubble data, the top that Ethereum just had is identical to the top in 2019. And then when Ethereum did that, it just kind of slowly bled down into uh the regression band. So it's it's tough because with the the main difference right now is that E Bitcoin is arguably in an uptrend not a downtrend. So in 2019 you could argue that it was in a downtrend. And so when it came down here when Bitcoin had the counter trend rally ETH Bitcoin was trending down. Now, if Bitcoin is in a counter trend rally, it looks like ETH Bitcoin generally is trending up, which is why you can't make too many bold declarations about what the USD price can and cannot do. You know, I mean, again, as we said before, Tesla had a very similar move where it ran up to the highs, came back down, and then went right back up. The main difference, though, is that Tesla dropped closer to like 55%, which would put Ethereum back at that fair value logarithmic regression trend line. for long-term investors in Ethereum."

Um, you know, if if you can kind of look at the market and not really care about, you know, is it going to hit a new all-time high or not, long-term, I do think there will be opportunities in 2026. Like, I think there's a good chance Ethereum will drop back into this logarithmic aggression trend line at some point in 2026. Um, it's just a matter of time, right? Right. And then by the next cycle when we're looking at this and Ethereum leaves the logarithmic regression line, then I think there's a lot more potential upside for it after that point. After at that point, you know, the regression band is completely caught up. Um, everything is caught up and then you're probably looking at much lower rates and and the money principles will come on a lot more out in that theoretical future uh than than right now. So, you know, my guess is it'll look something like this, right? And then it kind of comes out of it. There is a world where if Bitcoin rallies back to 100K and if ETH Bitcoin can definitively print a higher low, it's not impossible for Ethereum to go up, wick to a new high, and then come back down. But ultimately, that is probably how I I I sort of see it playing out is is seeing some better opportunities further out uh in 2026, regardless of of what ultimately happens in the short term. If you look actually at the year-to- date ROI of Ethereum, um, sorry, you look at the year-to- date ROI of ETH, and we just compare this year to the prior midterm years, 2018. You can see the Ethereum actually went up for the first two weeks of January, uh, before sort of falling back down. And back then it actually went up like 80% uh within a really short period of time and then it ultimately crashed a lot more. The reason why I don't think it'll follow this pattern is primarily as I've said before this is more of a pattern of topping on euphoria rather than apathy. Right? And as we've said before, if you look at at the social interest, it to me it looks more like we topped on apathy rather than euphoria, which more so lines up with that 2019 style drop in the market. More this like you had some bounces, but they didn't really go anywhere and they just kind of led to lower highs and lower lows for a little while. So I think that is is the most likely outcome, right? some bounces here and there, slowly go lower, and then start to pick back up later on in the year. In the short term, how high could Ethereum go? I mean, the bullmark support band, we're getting kind of close to it. It's currently at around 30 around 3,400 to 3,700 is where the bullmark sport band essentially is, but again, it is a it is a moving target. Um, I think that's mostly what I wanted to talk about. But I'm not going to spend a ton of time uh right now. Uh maybe ROI after the cycle peak, but also look at it for Ethereum. So if you look at it for Ethereum, um if you look at I guess these are the So you have the one in 2018 and of course you have the one in 2022. We need to add on the recent one. I don't think we've added that one yet onto onto this chart, but we can add that and and we'll we'll show it in a uh future future video."

I don't think we've added that one yet onto onto this chart, but we can add that and and we'll we'll show it in a uh future future video. I think we were kind of holding out for that one for Ethereum just to see what it would do in early 2026, mainly because it did put on a new all-time high in 2018. Uh so I wasn't completely closed off to it. Like I more so was closed off to it for Bitcoin, but I'm just being honest, right? Just being honest about about sort of the rationale there. Um, what's really interesting to me about Ethereum is is how we talked about this regression band so long ago and how it is so stubborn in ever wanting to go into it. Like it it just does not like spending time in the regression ban and it's like whenever it went there, it just immediately came out of it back when Ethereum went home as you guys remember. So kind of interesting observation for Ethereum. That's all I have for you guys right now. Uh again, now this is the window for Ethereum if it wants to sort of prove anything. If it doesn't happen in the next month or two, then my guess is that it won't happen until 2027 2028 time frame. I think what makes the most amount of sense is this comparison to 2019, right? And and one of the reasons for that is just kind of getting getting that top end before QTN's, right? getting the top end before QT ends, dropping in to the end of quantitative tightening, right? As you can see, like it sort of dropped into QT. Right after QT ended, Ethereum rallied back up to the bull market support band kind of like it's doing now and then it ultimately got rejected and then went deeper into the regression band. So, it's hard not to think that's ultimately how it plays out for me just looking at at a chart like this. And the thing is is like in a world where Ethereum does go to new all-time high, it would probably be a lot more bearish if that happens than if it just kind of slowly slowly drops down because that would actually more look like the uh the butterfly harmonic pattern that we talked about. So longterm it might actually be more bullish just kind of consolidate and then go out into into sort of the next cycle. But we'll see what happens.
