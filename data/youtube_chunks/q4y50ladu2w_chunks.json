      "text": "All right, if you're looking for Hopium, here \nit comes. I'm the crack dealer for Hopium. We   love Solana because it's so damn fast. So, \nyou want to increase bandwidth, you want to   reduce latency. There is this massive global \ncommunity of developers. Now, it's clear that,   you know, it's used for absolutely everything \nas cheap as physics allow. And I think that   that's really cool that we get to do both. And since then, you've written a book about   Solana of all things. Are we at an inflection \npoint? Have we hit our mainstream moment? Yeah,   I mean, I think that is essentially true. And now we're seeing that expand. Obviously,   the only one that's actually going to get \nyou there is Solana. And that's why we're   so excited about where Solana is and \nwhere it's going in the years to come. And then on Christmas Day, check your wallet \nbecause if you sign up using the link below, there   could be $10,000 deposited into your account from \nCindy. $10,000. Do it right now. We love that. This special coverage of Solana Breakpoint \nin Abu Dhabi is brought to you by Space,   the world's first leverage \nprediction markets on Solana. It's the end of 2025 and we are here at the \nEtihad Arena in Abu Dhabi. If you were a   speculator in 2025, 2025 was a very disappointing \nyear. But if you were a builder, it was the exact   opposite. It was a pivotal year. We're here at \nSolana Breakpoint. It's the ultimate conversion   between builders and speculators. Let's go see \nwhat they're building and what they think is   going to happen in 2026. What can 2026 bring? We \nall expected a bull market in 2025, but instead we   got a demotivating sideways chop. Bitcoin is flat, \nEthereum is flat, Solana's down. But underneath   the surface, what you realize is that while for \nspeculators, 2025 scammed us, rugged us, and wiped   out the leverage, 2025 was the ultimate pivotal \nyear for the builders, especially here at Solana. And what better way to end the year than \nto be here at the fifth Solana Breakpoint,   where the builders are building the decentralized \nspeculation engines. A big milestone and a   big conference. It is the beginning of \nsomething really special for developers,   for creators, for anybody who really \njust wants to get involved in the space. So you want to increase bandwidth,   you want to reduce latency. There is this \nmassive global community of developers who   have a vested interest in helping you \nso that we can all succeed together. Got the best culture, got the best community, \ngot the best tech. Where else would you build? Breakpoint 2025 is a big milestone. And remember, \nBanter is the only channel that has the boots on   the ground and has been covering Breakpoint every \nsingle year. And huge, it was over 3,500 attendees   from all over the world. Let's first rewind to \nthe week before the FTX fallout and start there. Remember, there's no other channel in crypto that \nbrings you direct access like this. From Bitcoin   in Miami to Ethereum and Vitalik to CZ and Binance \nin Paris and now here we are in Amsterdam talking   all things Solana. I'm going to show you who's \nbuilding on the chain. I've never seen so much   intellect per square foot in my life. You actually \nwouldn't believe what's going on. Let's go. So,   as you can see, we walk in here, the halls are \npacked. We have projects building on Solana. We   have the entire Solana development community \nand speculation community mixed in one place   right here at Abu Dhabi. Let's carry on taking \na walk. We arrive in Abu Dhabi and we're blown   away by the sheer scale of Breakpoint 2025. The theme absolute cinema and the layout was   absolutely cinematic. Key here, the UAE welcome \nand embracing all things crypto and blockchain,   positioning themselves as the regional leader. To us this is a significant moment for the first   time that we see Solana at a Breakpoint come \nto the Middle East. Abu Dhabi is the capital   of capital and increasingly it is also becoming \nthe capital of the blockchain innovation. Big   names were here. Coinbase, Crypto.com, Wormhole, \nPhantom, Firedancer and a long list of serious   Solana builders to DeFi to stablecoins. We \nnow clearly find ourselves in the internet   capital markets era for Solana. Our conviction \nis that upstream of everything is fair launching   tokens with real value. Breakpoint had multiple \nhalls, multiple exhibitors, multiple top talks,   including a talk from Raj and Anatoly, Solana's \nfounders, kicking things off here at the Arena."

Breakpoint had multiple halls, multiple exhibitors, multiple top talks, including a talk from Raj and Anatoly, Solana's founders, kicking things off here at the Arena. What you guys are most proud of in terms of \naccomplishments over the past five years thinking   back to that Breakpoint, you know, just the \nconstant reinvention of the network, the ecosystem   and the community. Now, it's clear that, you know, \nit's used for absolutely everything. Because of   those, we're able to build and develop technology \nthat can really serve global finance as cheap   as physics allow. And I think that that's really \ncool that we get to do both. Thank you, everyone. Our first day was all about interviews from \nthe speculators. The financial wizardry and   engineering right here on display. Mike Novogratz \nfrom Galaxy, Raoul Pal from Real Vision,   Kyle Samani from Multicoin, Anthony Scaramucci \nfrom Skybridge Capital. All here bridging TradFi,   Wall Street, and Institutions. It's \nhard for new chains to get enough air   to tell the story. And so conferences \nlike this help Solana tell its story. We love Solana because it's so damn \nfast. It was tailor built to be the   capital markets chain. It is a radical radical \ndeparture. It is awesome for this industry. So my job is the Hopium dealer and I've come \nto inject some hope in your veins. So here   gives you a chart of the money printing ahead. We've got about $8 trillion of money to print   via liquidity in the next 12 months. And \nI know a lot of you think that the crypto   cycle might be over and we can't have nice \nthings. I'm going to show you we can have   nice things. You just need to learn patience. It's the easiest macro environment of all time. It's driven by this one cycle. We know how \nlong it is. It's driven by the debt cycle. And we know that they print money to deal \nwith it. And Bitcoin has a 90% correlation. I'm here to talk about my new book which \ncame out yesterday called Solana Rising. And I thought it was very important \nto lay out the story because I think   2026 is going to be one of these \nbreakthrough years for this chain. If you consider the Solana network today, \nwell, we think Solana is really building   the most ambitious vision for the future \nof internet capital markets. The only one   that's actually going to get you there is \nSolana. And that's why we're so excited   about where Solana is and where it's going \nin the years to come. So, thank you all. We sat down with a murders row with these \nheadliners to get the macro and more importantly   to get a sense of where we've been in 2025 and \nwhere we're going in 2026. Are we at an inflection   point? Have we hit our mainstream moment? Yes. This is very clearly the inflection point that   we've all been waiting for. Every government \nin the world, frankly, is now actively working   on policy in this space. Actively trying to \nfigure out how to deal with dollar stablecoins,   how to deal with local stablecoins, how \nto deal with digital assets more broadly. And thank you for joining us at Breakpoint \ntoday. Awesome. Thank you, Kristen. Thanks,   everyone. Then after day one, we sat down with the \nbuilders one after the other, rapid fire, getting   under the hood to see all things development right \nhere at Solana. We sat down with Zero, with Jito,   with Jupiter, Pyth, Drift, Helium, Kast, and even \nLegion. And just 2 months ago, we launched Pyth   Pro. Every asset class updated every millisecond, \nbuilt by the best traders in the world. And the   best part of it is it's 10x less expensive than \nanything else on the market. Thanks everyone. Before the start, I wanted to show you exactly \nwhere this is all happening. It's happening   inside an arena and it just shows you the size of \nBreakpoint 2025 and the size of Solana in 2025."

Now, let's carry on and take a look outside to see \nthe sponsors and everything that's going on. We're   going to be bringing you all the alpha. We're \ngoing to be here looking for the top signals. We'll see what people are building and we'll see \nwhat all the long lines are about for Seekers,   for Solana, for cards, for all things happening \nright here. Solana Breakpoint is the key pulse   check for me every single year. And here with \nBanter, you've got a front row seat to close out   2025. Okay, enough overview. Let's get into the \ndeep dive. First up, Raoul Pal from Real Vision. People love him because he's always bullish. And here today he's bullish again. This time he   broke down why 2025 tanked and why he thinks 2026 \nwill be the real boom for speculators. All right,   if you're looking for Hopium, here it comes. I'm \nthe crack dealer for Hopium. So before we get into   speaking about Solana, I want to talk to you about \nthe macro. We had the FOMC earlier in the week and   pretty much the best FOMC we could have got. We \ngot the rate cut. It wasn't a hawkish rate cut as   they mentioned and Bitcoin's trading down. Like what's going on in this cycle? Well,   there's something weird still going on with \nliquidity outside of are there any dead bodies   from October? We don't know. But liquidity, we've \ngot to get through year-end funding. There's not   enough liquidity still in the system, which is why \nthe Fed actually did more than expected because   they know. I still think they're going to have \nto do another measure in the term repo just to   get the banks through their year-end funding. So, liquidity is still tight. And because we're   the furthest out on the risk curve, we suffer when \nthere's no liquidity. But next year, they've made   changes, things like the SLR, the Supplementary \nLeverage Ratio, which is to allow the banks to   take more risk and absorb more treasuries. That \nis liquidity. So the Treasury can print the bonds,   the banks buy them, they turn it into magic \nbank money. Money creation. It's money creation,   and that's liquidity. So, it's all to come, but \nwe're still in this weird patch, this December   patch where the Fed have got the Treasury have got \non December 15th a whole bunch of bills to sell. That's going to suck money out of the system. There's not enough money for year-end funding. So,   it's still a bit wobbly. So, how do you see the \nroadmap into 2026? I can't see it any other way   than we've got to roll $10 trillion of debt. The \nonly way of doing it is by printing money. They've   made the regulatory change to force the banks to \ndo it, which we knew was going to come because   that's the next buyer. They're already using the \nbalance sheet. We've got the big beautiful bill,   which is a hugely simulative tax cut that's \nthere to juice the economy into the midterm   elections. We've got Scott Bessent and Donald \nTrump saying we're going to have a really strong   economy because basically they're going to pump \nliquidity, fiscal stimulus, regulatory clarity. They're already saying crypto is one of the key \nindustries that we want and so I can only see with   that that the number has to go up. Do you see a \nworld with stimulus checks next year? I know that   Trump and Bessent have spoken about it. You think \nit's coming? They will buy anything to get through   this midterm. It is the most important game \nbecause don't forget this government is backed   by the technologists and they've said they need \nrates to go lower and that's for two reasons."

I know that Trump and Bessent have spoken about it. You think it's coming? They will buy anything to get through this midterm. It is the most important game because don't forget this government is backed by the technologists and they've said they need rates to go lower and that's for two reasons. One,   they want mortgages down, but the other reason is \ninterest payments on the debt need to be at the   same as GDP. I've talked about this a lot in the \nEverything Code and GDP growth, let's say in 2026,   maybe 3 and a half percent. Or 3% or 2 and \na half percent of trend rate of growth,   take an average over time and interest rates are \ntoo high still. So they have to jam interest rates   lower, stimulate the housing market, then push \nliquidity into the system which stimulates all   of the markets, then chuck in tax stimulus. How can that not be good? But crypto gets it   the most. The ISM has been below 50 for 4 years \nnow. It's insane. And it's the first time that   it didn't line up with a 4-year cycle. Yeah. So I \nbelieve it's the ISM cycle we should be following   not the which is based on the debt cycle and the \ndebt cycle got extended to 5 and a half years or   5.4 years. So that's pushed it out which gives \nus a cycle through to the end of 2026. Guys, I   told you there would be Hopium and you got to vibe \nRaoul. It's so good to see you my friend. Always   good. See you. Thank you. This cycle, that cycle, \nwe're here for the Hopium. And then we moved on to   Anthony Scaramucci, the Skybridge Capital CEO who \nactually once did a White House stint and now well   now he's written a book about Solana. And I think \n2026 is going to be a phenomenal year for all of   us. He's our bridge into TradFi and I wanted to \nsee how TradFi are seeing Solana. Been a long time   since we've been together in front of a camera \nmy friend. But I like being a camera in front   of you. We did kill the whales together, lots of \ninterviews, a Bitcoin debate. Remember that night   in Florida? And since then you've written a book \nabout Solana of all things. Why did you choose   to write a book about Solana? Uh well I own a ton \nof Solana. I own a ton of it for clients. We have   it on our balance sheet and I think it's very \nimportant for the demographic that I live in,   I'm a lot older than you, to understand it. And \nthe only way they're really going to understand   it is through a narration. So I took people \nthrough the origin story, Anatoly's story,   how he thought about building it, what how the \nfeatures of it from a technological perspective. I mean one of the beauties of Solana and Anatoli \nalways mentions this is that he didn't try to   reinvent the wheel. He took all existing computer \nscience, all existing software technology to build   Solana and to create the scalability and the \nspeed and the lower cost. And so it's easy to   develop on and I think it's going to be part of \nthe long-term infrastructure/architecture of the   future of finance. So your market is a lot more \nconservative. They're a lot safer. How are they   accepting Solana? I'm the only person wearing \na tie in this room other than the security,   right? Yeah. So, you know, my market is a lot \nmore conservative. How accepting are they of   like things beyond Bitcoin and ETH? So we're \ngetting there now. So, you talk about people   paying attention, but when I look at the prices, \npeople aren't paying attention because if I look   at every other risk asset, Russell 2000, silver, \ngold, everything's up, everything's up at all   time highs. And look at Bitcoin. Well, I think \nyou got to zoom out. I mean, I hear you. It's   been a difficult year. I think expectation and \nanticipation was too high for the year. It was   a little bit like the Shawshank Redemption."

And look at Bitcoin. Well, I think you got to zoom out. I mean, I hear you. It's been a difficult year. I think expectation and anticipation was too high for the year. It was a little bit like the Shawshank Redemption. If you remember the book, we had a jailbreak   in 2024. You know, we were getting our heads \nstuffed in a toilet by Elizabeth Warren and Gary   Gensler. And you know, whatever my issues are with \nPresident Trump, I applaud him for his political   instincts and understanding how important the \nblockchain, crypto technology, Solana, Bitcoin,   etc. are for the future of finance and for the \nfuture of America in order to maintain its mantle   of financial services leadership. So, we had a \njailbreak, an explosion in prices. People levered   up expecting lots of regulatory bills getting \npassed this year. I mean, we got one of them   passed, but the big one, the market structure one, \nwhich I think is the most detailed, didn't get   passed this year. Be 2026. I think it will be. So, \nthat's the thing. I like 2026 is the expectations   are super low. If you look at the Fear & Greed \nIndex, everybody's toggled on fear. If you go   to the beginning of the year or the end of last \nyear, everybody was toggled on greed. And so,   people have blown out of their positions. They've \ndelevered. We've got some healing to happen in the   industry right now. But you know it and I know it. There's lots of underlying demand in these ETFs,   lots of net buying. And so I like it. But listen, \nyou know Bitcoin better than me. You know crypto   better than me. You know, it's a jagged edge. It looks like a very bad EKG, but it does move   up and to the right. Up and right. And that's \nprobably what 2026 is going to be like. Thank   you very much, my friend. Great to be on up and \nto the right. That's exactly what we like to hear. Next up, let's hear from the ultimate builder, not \na speculator. Jeremy Allaire from Circle created   and engineered the world's first tokenized real \nworld asset framework with USDC. And now, let's   see what's next for the publicly listed company. Jeremy, so good to see you again. And also,   just off the stage, you guys are doing absolutely \nincredible things. The listing is now behind you. You're a publicly listed company. What's the \nvision going forward? You know, over the last   seven years or so, we focused so much on building \nour stablecoin network and the largest regulated   stablecoin network in the world. It's growing \nfaster than any other major stablecoin in the   world. We grew 108% year-over-year in the last \nquarter, faster than again any other major stable. The transaction volumes on our stablecoin network \ngrew 580% year-over-year to nearly $10 trillion   in transactions in Q3. And the use cases are \nexpanding incredibly fast. The number of major   institutions that are integrating this from \ne-commerce platforms to others are growing for   this sort of next phase of growth in the internet \neconomic system. What do you need a stablecoin   chain for when the other chains are so fast and \npretty cheap? Over the next, you know, 10 to 15   years that the role of these economic operating \nsystems is going to expand dramatically and we're   going to see through the combination of AI and \nthese economic OSs, we're going to see more and   more parts of the entire economic system, not just \nstablecoins and payments, but the establishment of   the mechanisms of how we run a corporation, how \ncontracts between entities work, how contracts   are executed by AI, how governance happens in the \nworld. We also believe that a distributed network   model where you have active participation from \nmajor governments and infrastructure operators   who have a stake in a network and participate in \na governance of a network that can wire together   economic systems around the world whatever the \npolitical or economic bent of those is."

We also believe that a distributed network model where you have active participation from major governments and infrastructure operators who have a stake in a network and participate in a governance of a network that can wire together economic systems around the world whatever the political or economic bent of those is. Am I   right in saying that it's the framework the legal \nframework for most real world assets right now? Because as far as I know there's no real other \nregulated real world asset framework other than   the one that you guys pioneered. We believe that \nassets will exist and need to proliferate and   work across many networks whether it's a tokenized \nfund or tokenized real estate or a credit contract   or other things to do that and so we want to \nbe a liquidity and distribution hub for those   things. So 2025 would you say was a good year a \ndisappointing year and then the next question is   how do you see 2026? 2025 was a fantastic year. Compare where we were a year ago to where we are   today. We have almost every major institution in \nthe world looking at this. We have the regulators   in markets around the world basically rolling back \nyou know and embracing in different ways. We have   a race around the world to enable this. And so this is phenomenal and technology   progress has been incredible whether you're \nin the Solana ecosystem, the EVM ecosystem,   other and other platforms, privacy technology, \nso many things, Hyperliquid, like just incredible   progress this year. So I'm more optimistic \nthan I've ever been. Way more optimistic than   I've ever been. 2026 should be a phenomenal \nyear for quality of execution, new products,   new experiences. If you just focus on the price of \ncrypto assets, you're missing the picture. Well,   that's it, guys. That's the difference between the \nbuilders and the speculators. The speculators were   disappointed by 2025. But the builders say it was \none of the most incredible years they ever had. Jeremy, so good to see you, my friend. Great \nto see you, too. Yeah, thanks. So, Circle not   focusing on prices. One builder who's been at the \ncenter of blockchain and banking for years is Bill   Barhydt. And after his announcement on stage, I \nkind of suspect these guys may be going public. He's a key Wall Street sentiment indicator and so \nI always like to check in. Well, it's been about a   year since you've actually had you on data in that \nyear. We've got a new administration, pro-crypto,   favorable administration. The industry's emerged, \nbut the one that hasn't moved is the price. The   price is a little bit higher than it was last \nyear. Sure. I always turn to you because you   always break it down beautifully. What's going \non? So, I think right after the election,   the kind of risk discount closed. Okay. So that \nwas the bump from where were we? 50 to 90 whatever   that was within 90. Yeah. Right. So that's what I \ncall the \"Kamala wins risk crypto dies discounted   price\". That discount closed and Bitcoin found \nits level. So we're at the cusp of 2026. How do   you see the market playing out in 2026? Yeah QE \nis going to start presently. Powell has basically   said he said yesterday call it whatever you want. He said, \"I'm going to start buying 40 billion a   month in treasuries.\" I think they're going to do \nmore, right? I think unemployment is going to tick   up. I think they're causing stagflation. It's \npart of the hangover from the Biden, you know,   money printing. There's nothing they can do about \nit now. But with, you know, a trillion in interest   payments, there's really nothing they can do to \nstop the train as we say, right? So, you're going   to see quantitative easing, reset of debt, you're \nstill going to see higher rates than what they   want, but they're going to be flooding the system \nwith money. I think Trump is going to do stimulus   checks before the midterms. He's going to take \nthis tariff money."

I also think so, which I think   is a horrible idea and there's no way that's not \ngoing to make its way into risk on assets, right? And so it may not be the COVID boom, but it's \nI just don't see how we don't see significantly   higher prices next year. What about this theory \nthat there's the old cohort of Bitcoiners that are   starting to offload their coins because Bitcoin \nwent over $100,000? Do you think that's what's   keeping the price down? Because ETH is actually \nstarting to outperform Bitcoin now. Yeah, I   think there was an equilibrium which I thought was \nreally interesting in the fall between people who   were turning out of Bitcoin or taking some profits \nfrom you know 6, 7, 8 years ago and new money   coming in. That's why the price didn't come down \nto 70, 60,000. Also, there was a little bit of   leverage in the system which had to make its way \nout while you know the maxis were selling a little   bit and so I think they found an equilibrium in \nthat 95k range which I thought was pretty bullish. Now listen, I'm speaking to you now before you're \ngoing up on stage tomorrow. Quick taste of before   you go up on stage. What can we expect? Um well \nwe are going to be announcing our foray into   real world assets. I won't give it all away but \nit's super cool. It's something that I it's been   a pet project of mine for over a year. Something \nwe're spinning out of Abra actually. And we are   I'll say you know wink wink to the audience. We \nare very strongly considering a public listing   in Q1 of next year. And so that's now acting as \nrocket fuel for our business. All right guys,   you heard it Jeff first. There's going to be \nan announcement on the stage. We can't leak   the announcement just yet, but you'll hear it \nby the time the show comes out. Bill, thank you   very much my friend. Good to see you. If you look \naround the building here at Breakpoint, it's tough   not to be bullish. But for all those builders, \ncan they be heads down in building or do they   need to worry about running out of runway? Do they \nneed to pivot? When we come back, we'll go rapid   fire into project after project on Solana to see \nexactly what's happening under the hood. How's it   going? How's it going? Good. Good. Remember, this \nspecial coverage is brought to you by Space. Space   is the world's first leverage prediction markets. Go and check them out. They're launching soon. No one is born special. But some people \nare born different. They just want a bit   more. They take bigger risks because for them \nthere is no plan B. They're the kind of people   who go all in and bet on themselves. And even when no one believes in them,   they double down, go even harder. They speed up. They raise the stakes. They risk everything to win it \nall for people who want more. Welcome back to Solana Breakpoint. Here at \nBreakpoint, the network is now celebrating   its fifth year anniversary. And so here we're \nhearing announcements, people sharing ideas, and   we're hearing all about the biggest developments. We continue our coverage of Breakpoint 2025. And   I want to show you something absolutely amazing. Come and have a look. This is another one of the   areas, another one of the hubs. So on the one \nside you have the Solana gaming console. So   this is a specific Solana gaming console over \nhere. You can see that over here. Also lots of   hype going on here. But more importantly, more \nimportantly, look at what's going on here with   the Seeker phone. And people can actually win a \nSeeker phone over there. Just have a look at that."

But more importantly, more importantly, look at what's going on here with the Seeker phone. And people can actually win a Seeker phone over there. Just have a look at that. Let's go back to the Solana team for a recap of \nall the biggest headlines from Breakpoint. Better   than I can do myself. Next was a milestone 3 years \nin the making. Firedancer is live on Mainnet. It's been quietly running on a small \nset of validators for 100 days,   producing 50,000 blocks. With a sigma locked in, \nattention shifted to how institutions move assets   on Solana. Kamino started with the introduction \nof its new identity, an infrastructure layer for   institutional finance and tokenized assets, \nlaunching with a refreshed brand and six new   products. Figure then revealed they filed for a \nsecond IPO, but this time with equity being issued   as a token natively on Solana. No NYSE, no NASDAQ, \njust a DeFi ready security you can use on chain. Then Phantom took the spotlight, announcing the \nintegration of Kalshi's tokenized prediction   markets powered by Solana and DFlow. On-chain \ntrading events just leveled up for over 20 million   users. Today pushed Solana's infrastructure, \ninstitutions, and culture to a new year. Day   two raised the bar. Tomorrow raises it again. First up, we have Austin Federa. He was a longtime   Solana staffer. He's become the bridge between the \nnetwork and the builders. He left Solana and he's   now building his own project called Zero. And \nhe's kicking us off with a look into the Solana   project. Zero is the internet in the internet \ncapital markets. This is a new high-performance   blockchain infrastructure layer. So, as we said, \nif you were a builder, 2025 was one of the best   years you ever had. If you were a speculator, \nprobably one of the most disappointing years that   you've ever had. Here's a builder. Maybe just give \nus the background of what you're building. Yeah,   sure. So, Zero is at its core a physical fiber \ninfrastructure network optimized for blockchain   and other types of high performance systems. We have multiple contributors that are either   contributing fiber that they own, they lease, they \nhave some sort of access to already and they're   using that to build this new parallel internet \nthat runs alongside the public internet but much   faster. Why do we need it? The thing the internet \nwas built for was not performance. It was built   for reachability and it does an incredible job \nof that. And blockchain's kind of matured to the   place where we're competing with traditional \nmarkets. We're competing with NASDAQ and NYSE   and we're bringing equities on chain. We're \ntokenizing a bunch of stuff and so we need to   upgrade that base layer physical infrastructure \nto compete. Is the project ready now? Do we have   a second decentralized very fast internet? We \ndo. Yeah. We launched the mainnet in on October   2nd and since then we've got about 40% of Solana \nrunning on it by stake, 50% by validator count. So we've had a pretty fast adoption. But how much \nare people actually profiting from the speed of   this decentralized fiber network? Yeah. So we just \nstarted onboarding the RPC providers, basically   the transaction senders. And so for them, they're \nseeing a little bit of increased profitability for   this, but really it's not necessarily about the \ninterblock trading as much. There's a portion of   that that's definitely about profitability. It's \nabout the ability to go from 10,000 transactions   per second to 500,000. And so more base fees, you \nknow, it's sort of like you can either sell one   contract to a company for $20 million or you can \nbe Slack and you can sell everyone a $7 a month   subscription. Austin, well, I hope you do lift \nall boats because that means we all have faster   internet, more decentralized internet, and faster \ntrades, right? Yeah. Austin, thank you very much,   my friend. All right, guys. Let's dive deeper into \nthe world of Solana builders and Solana projects."

All right, guys. Let's dive deeper into the world of Solana builders and Solana projects. So the 60,000 ft view and Anatoly is the most \nimportant person in Solana. But arguably the most   important protocol on Solana is Jito because it \ncaptures most the stake and it captures most the   value. Builders, builders, builders. That's what \nthe theme is here today. And one of the biggest   builders on Solana is actually Jito or Jito Labs. Guys, you've had a tough year this year. You guys   have been building like crazy, but the token price \ndoesn't reflect it. What do you think the market's   missing? Yeah, I think we need to tell our story \na little bit better and I think we previously   have expected people to understand the value of \nJito that we provide and kind of didn't treat the   token as a product and try trying to change our \nmindset around that. And so what is the value that   Jito offers? I mean I know Jito is the by far \nthe largest staking protocol on Solana. Yeah,   so we're the largest liquid staking protocol in \nSolana. Take a lot of fees from that and then also   on the MEV side in the trading infrastructure side \nwe capture fees from that as well so very closely   intertwined with the inner workings of Solana \nand the fee generation there we kind of think of   ourselves as the economic engine Solana how big \nare you like relative to the rest of the market   you have a big market share how big is the market \nshare yeah so today around 95% of the network   supports Jito and so yeah we spent that the past \ntwo years filling a lot of that up. I think last   time we talked to you, we were probably like \n60% or something. So, we're pretty steady around   95-96% today. So, you're bullish Solana 2026. Yeah, all the builders are coming to Solana. The   network's performing way better. Transaction \nfees are going down. Network's getting more   efficient and all the app builders are coming to \nSolana. Do you do you believe now that Solana has   enough network effect to be the monolithic layer \none in the blockchain space? Yeah, but job's not   finished. I think there's a lot more that we can \ndo. We need more builders coming on chain. All the   current builders need to keep continuing to build \nand iterate on their products. And I think we one   thing that we're kind of not doing super well on, \nbut I think there's a lot of bullish developments   on is Perps. So we got to keep making Perps better \nand try to take some of the market share from some   of the other chains and centralized exchanges. Amazing. So 2025 was actually a good year for   the builders and 2026 sounds like it's going to be \neven better. Brother, thank you so much. Thanks. Also hoping for a big 2026 and one of the biggest \nprotocols on Solana is Jupiter. Everyone thinks   they're just an aggregator, but they're one of \nthe biggest super apps on chain. We sat down   with their new president. There's probably two \nprotocols that you have to talk about when you   talk about Solana. The one is Jito, and we spoke \nto Jito earlier. And the second one is Jupiter. What is Jupiter? How do you see Jupiter? Well, \nJupiter, you know, when it started, it was indeed   the DEX aggregator, the leading DEX aggregator \non Solana. It was at at a time when there was   the liquidity layers on Solana were extremely \nfragmented. And so that was where Jupiter really   found product market to fit very very early \non. But since then, I think with our incredible   sort of product and tech team, we built Jupiter \ninto the onchain super app. We have like over 13   revenue generating product lines serving all kinds \nof use cases and audiences on chain."

So what's the   ones that are out of the 13? What are the ones \nthat excite you the most? Of course the the newer   ones that we just launched prediction markets \nprediction markets with Khosla were the largest   prediction markets venue on on Solana already \nwith that integration. How many users use Jupiter   daily? Like if you would like to take a number \nof like all the services and how many users does   Jupyter have on a daily basis? So today, year to \ndate, we have about 30 million active wallets year   to date. Obviously we come a long way. Probably \nlike most of the people that interact on chain   with Solana have or are using Jupiter across our \nfull stack. So we have a mobile, we have desktop,   we have developer APIs, right? We have integrated \nwith thousands of applications and projects that   all use sort of our data, our tech, our what's the \nmost used tech? Is it the is it the aggregator,   the swapper, the original? The our trading engine. It's called Ultra. It's the the most advanced   trading engine I think in all of DeFi and powering \nessentially Solana transactions and yeah I think a   lot of venue are integrated with our trading venue \nincluding the likes of Robin Hood Wallet, Uniswap,   even you know we're completely we welcome everyone \nwho wants to bring their users on onto Solana on   chain. So, I'm not going to ask you what you \nwere excited about in 2025 because you only   really joined now, but what are you excited about \nin 2026? Look um I think it is announced but we   will very soon launch our own stablecoin JupUSD \nyou know will be in partnership with Ethena but   just just one of the examples that we are really \nexcited about to properly move composable you know   assets tokenized assets such as stablecoins on \nchain and generate ultimately more yield and more   benefits for everyone who uses stablecoins and \ninteract with DeFi and we need to just build the   best application layer and the best products and \nintegrate with you know vision aligned partners   crew onchain finance the builder manifesto here \nat Breakpoint thank you in other sectors when we   talk about oracles we always talk about Pyth and \nChainlink but there's a massive price difference   between the two you think it can catch up you know \nwhen we talk about oracles in crypto two names   come to mind the one is Chainlink and obviously \nthe other one is Pyth and for years we've been   saying that the Pyth token is so undervalued \nrelative to the Chainlink token it's not justified   And after I heard Mike talking on stage today, \nI'm like, dude, what's going on? Why is the   market not realizing the value that you guys are \nactually providing? Because the updates that you   gave were absolutely phenomenal, right? Yeah. Yeah. Give us some of the updates. So, some of   the updates are the first thing is like we built \nPyth a long time ago so that we could provide US   equity data on chain. No one's needed it or used \nit until this year. The reason for that is that we   had an aggressive SEC that basically wouldn't let \nyou build anything. So we have all these protocols   that now want to use real world assets, the thing \nwe've had accumulated for a really long time that   we can bring onchain and we're seeing a tremendous \namount of demand from that. So we launched Pyth   Pro. Pyth Pro is a premium subscription data feed \nthat enterprises can use for onchain or off-chain   like businesses. And this has been blowing up. So we've just had our first month or two months   of of launch. We passed a million dollars of ARR \nin the first couple of weeks. We've had about 10   inbounds every single week from enterprises."

We've \nhad over 80 subscribers on. This is on top of the   700 non-subscription paying enterprise that we \nhave on Pyth Core. And what's exciting about it   today is we just unveiled the Pyth Reserve. So \nPyth Reserve is going to take all that revenue. Now we're selling these subscriptions for dollars. We put that into the DAO and the DAO goes out and   buys Pyth tokens on the open market and holds. And what do you think 2026 is going to be like? Hyperscaling of that. I think that we've only \nscratched the surface. The amount of inbounds   that we're getting and institutions that want to \nuse this data is incredible. I think that we're   going to go from 3,000 instruments to over 10,000 \nby the end of next year. You're going to be really   excited to see some of the bank names that start \nparticipating on both sides of the market. So it's   just going to go much deeper and much faster. So guys, I dropped a message in Front Runners   earlier today, which is our private Discord, and I \nsaid that one of my buys, one of the big buys from   me in 2026 is actually going to be Pyth. If you \nwant to join Front Runners, there's a link below. Otherwise, go and check out the Pyth token. Like \nwe always say, join Front Runners if you want the   alpha. All right, more alpha. Looking back, 2025 \nwas the year of Perps DEXs. And without a doubt,   Hyperliquid took the lead. But can 2026 be the \nyear where Drift actually catches up? So, as I've   been saying, if you were a speculator, 2025 was \ndisappointing. If you were a builder, 2025 was the   most incredible pivotal year ever. But what if you \nwere a builder that was building for speculators? Then how does your year look? Cindy, you're that \nfounder, right? So, how was 2025? 2025, I mean,   if you look at the start of the year, everything \nwas at all-time highs. Uh we saw probably the most   bullish sentiment around January, but like \ngeneral shakiness around the market, right? And then you uh you saw a lot of uncertainty \nin the middle of the year, volatility, macro   movements and a lot of Degens getting wiped out \nin the last couple months that culminated in the   big October event. Right. So basically the start \nof the year was a huge leverage buildup caused   out of massive bullishness and then kind of a big \nreckoning moment in the last two months. How you   how do you think you're fairing in the competitive \nenvironment? How competitive is Drift and Drift V3   at that? Yeah. So, we just launched Drift V3 last \nweek and here at Breakpoint, if you compare Drift   V3 with Drift V2, you'll actually see almost a 10x \nimprovement in speed and in liquidity compared to   V2. And the reason is that we've stripped away all \nof the things that create any sense of latency. And so, when you press like we enable gasless \ntrading for instance, you never need to sign   a transaction again. I think where we win is the \nfact that we have two things. One is that all your   collateral is earning yield on Drift. So you ear \nyou deposit USDC without doing anything. You're   earning like 3% or 5%. You can use any asset as \ncollateral. So that's where we win across all   of our competitors. We're the only exchange that \nenables this and all the other friends I would say   comparable if not better. What do you think 2026 \nis going to be like? I think 2026 is going to be   a consolidation year for Perps DEXs. Like a lot \nof the Perps DEXs that were built with you know   lower risk management are going to be wiped out."

Frankly, leverage trading is a dangerous game and   if you don't do risk parameters well enough like \neventually eventually things are going to blow up. 2026 is probably going to be a even more volatile \nyear. Okay, so guys listen, get this. You want to   try Drift V3. Now, I know we've tried Drift \nV2 and Drift V1, but now Cindy's told us that   Drift V3 is like the best. It's as it's very fast \nand it's decentralized. There is a link below. Go   and try Drift V3 using the link below. And then \non Christmas Day, check your wallet because if   you've signed up using the link below, there could \nbe $10,000 deposited into your account from Cindy. She didn't know about this before the interview, \nbut now she knows about it. It's coming from VR's   checking account. No, seriously, it is coming from \nme. There's a link below. Drift V3. Try it between   now and Christmas. Check your account on Christmas \nday. Check your wallet on Christmas Day and you   may get an extra $10,000. Do it right now. We love \nthat. Thank you. Great. Great. You know what also   excites me? When crypto projects get real world \nadoption without people knowing that they're   actually crypto. And in that vein, we met with \nthe founder of Helium, revolutionizing all things   cellular networks. One of the projects that really \nhad a big year, and I mean really had a big year,   is Helium. You got to hear these numbers guys. Give us the numbers quickly. How many phones in   the network now? We are seeing 2 million phones \nusing the network every single day. A real crypto   utility. So for those users who don't know what \nHelium is, and I'm sure there's a lot of users out   there who don't know what it is. Just quickly, \nhow does Helium work? What is So Helium is a a   new way of building telecom. It's allowing the \nindividual to operate their own radio and join   a large network that's shared and they get the \nbenefit every time a phone connects to it. And   so you know Helium is on the on the network side \nis a way to sort of democratize access to connect. So it's a mobile phone network that's actually \nmade up of multiple small providers that provide   networks. Now I know that in South Africa for \nexample where we live you need a telecom's license   to provide a network. I mean is that normal around \nthe world or how does it work? That is the case   everywhere. And so you know what we do we have \nwhat's called an offload network. It's a it's   a network that enhances the existing telecom \ninfrastructure that's out there. It's using,   you know, something that we're all very used to, \nWi-Fi. Because all of our phones are very smart,   right? When you go into a venue or when you go \nhome, your phone automatically connects to the   Wi-Fi at home, right? You're not like checking \nfor the SSID or checking for the password because   it's already built in there. Helium does the \nsame thing, but when you walk into an airport   or you're walking into a coffee shop, you're not \nasking for the SSID. Your SIM, your SIM on your   phone is just authenticating. It does. It already \nhas everything it needs. How are they paying you? They're not paying you with with crypto. Are they \npaying you with they're paying in fiat? So we have   two customers. We have the direct customers folks \nthat you know go to heliummobile.com. They buy a   SIM. They're paying us anywhere between 05 or $30 \na month for a service depending on the kind of   service they want. So if I understand correctly, \nright now your users are all United States users,   right? What's the plan to expand?"

The world is big and we'd   love to participate everywhere, you know, here in \nAbu Dhabi. But you know the more sort of sooner   is going to be Mexico where we've been in sort \nof technical integration with a local carrier   called Movistar. It's one of the Telefonica \nbrands. And they we're sort of at the like that   last mile of what we need to do on the technical \nside. And pretty soon every single Movistar   customer will will be able to also join the Helium \nnetwork and any Helium deployer will be able to   provide coverage for for Movistar customers. So \nthat's going to come up soon and then this week   we announced that we're also going to be expanding \ninto Brazil. There's already a deployer out there   who has 40,000 locations. Guys, that's exactly \nwhat I told you. You look at the token prices. Token prices are down. But you heard the numbers. You heard the roll out. They're talking about   almost an international expansion. That makes \nme excited to be in crypto in 2026. Brother,   thank you so much. You're making me excited to be \nhere. Okay. You want the excitement to continue? Let's talk about my Kast card. You know how much \nI love my Kast card. As you can see over here,   a Kast coffee station. Kast obviously sponsors \nour show and sponsors all the coffee stations. So,   we're going to go from the Kast coffee station \nto actually talk to Kast at our station. So,   watch and see for another big Banter giveaway. Five people on Christmas Day. Merry Christmas,   guys. Guys, if you've been following Banter at \nall, you know I'm so excited about my solid gold   Kast card. You hear that? That's what solid gold \nsounds like. But I want to give you more insight   into the project behind this amazing card. And \nstick around till the end because at the end I'm   going to give you guys an unbelievable one-time \noffering which Raghu doesn't even know that he's   funding yet, but he will find out at the end of \nthis. So this is a card at the FA at face value. It's a card, but you say it's much more than a \ncard. You say it's actually like a bank. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, we came out with a card product \nand it was the easiest way to spend your crypto. But the full vision for what I wrote at \nthe very beginning was to build a global   bank built on stablecoins and we call it better \nthan a bank. So you go onto the you you go onto   the app or you go onto the website, you get a \ncard, you link a wallet to the card and then   you can send stables and you can basically spend \nyour crypto in real world stores, online stores,   etc., etc. That's the first part of being a bank, \nright? Yeah. What's the next part? So on top of   that, we also have a savings account now coming. So you can hold it in US dollar treasury rates. We've also partnered with Gauntlet so you can \nget rates that are similar to Morpho or Aave   I think sitting around 7% we're as high as 10%. And the other thing is that now you can actually   send money anywhere in the world using Swift. So \nyou can send money via Swift to 125 countries. Everyone gets a US dollar bank account, an actual \nfiat bank account where you can receive money. Like I just sold some stock in the US. Instead of \nsending it to Singapore where I normally send it   to my Citibank, I just sent it to my Kast account \nfor my IBAN Swift numbers. You basically send it   to your Kast account."

We've also partnered with Gauntlet so you can get rates that are similar to Morpho or Aave I think sitting around 7% we're as high as 10%. And the other thing is that now you can actually send money anywhere in the world using Swift. So you can send money via Swift to 125 countries. Everyone gets a US dollar bank account, an actual fiat bank account where you can receive money. Like I just sold some stock in the US. Instead of sending it to Singapore where I normally send it to my Citibank, I just sent it to my Kast account for my IBAN Swift numbers. You basically send it to your Kast account. So you're getting a crypto \naccount and normal account basically in one. You're packaging it into one. Exactly. Exactly. And you can hold your crypto there. You can borrow   against it as well. So you've literally merge \nbanking and you don't need to walk into a branch. You can do everything online and then you get \nyourself an international global card. Exactly. Now I've been spending on this card guys. Now, \nthe best thing about this card is when you spend,   you get like an alert back which tells you exactly \nhow much money you get back. What are the numbers   here? Yeah, so at the moment, um, we've done it \nover different seasons. So, the base one is 2%. And then we're also doing one where it's on the \nhigher card, it's 5%, on the very highest card,   the solid gold card, it's 8%. And they change over \ntime. Yeah, you're on the you're on the 8%. Um,   but we're also super excited. I think in a few \ndays we're going to be releasing a partnership   um with uh one of the very large sort of \nfoundations who for a limited time over   the next few months we're going to be airdropping \n4% in tokens on top. So just so just wait we wait   till we fully announce it but you're going to be \ngetting not only points with us but you're also   going to get get an airdrop up to the first $5,000 \nof spending but it's a solid amount of money back   as well. So it's an incentive to really accelerate \nadoption of Kast as well. I've got a good offer   for you guys. As I said, not only are you going \nto get the percentage back, not only you going   to get the airdrop that he spoke about, but if \nyou take a card out between now and Christmas,   I'm going to choose five people and I'm going \nto upgrade your card to a gold card. Now, Raghu   doesn't know this, and you can see the look on \nhis face here because you're not really supposed   to be upgraded to a gold card, but if you sign up \nbetween now and Christmas, check on Christmas Day,   and I may upgrade you to your very own solid gold \ncard. Look how he's sweating. He was sweating. I'm   He wasn't sweating before I said gold card. We \nhave a rule that we don't absolutely don't give   it away for free. But you know, I can't resist. Five people. Five people. Five people. Sign up   between now and Christmas. There is a link below. Use the link below. Sign up for Kast between   now and Christmas and check your account. I'll \nupgrade you before Christmas. And thanks to 2025   for coming to an end. Here's to a much bigger and \nmuch better 2026 for all us speculators out there. Regardless, as we've explored across the Solana \necosystem, builders are building with their heads   down. Here in Abu Dhabi, Breakpoint celebrated the \nnetwork's fifth anniversary. It's a huge milestone   for the layer 1 that was founded by Anatoly \nand Raj in this very kitchen setting right   here over two coffees and a beer. Or at least \nthat's the story according to Anatoly himself. I had two coffees and a beer with a friend \nof mine and I was up till 4 in the morning   and I had this Eureka moment. When I knew that I \ncould generate a data structure permissionlessly   that represented passage of time, I knew that I \ncould build TDMA and that means I could build a   fast network. Since then, it's become one of \nthe biggest and baddest unstoppable networks   crypto has ever experienced. We've covered every \nBreakpoint to date like no other channel can do. You decide. Is 2026 going to be a big year ahead?"
