      "text": "Good morning, and today we are going to talk \nabout AI and crypto. Just to let you know,   I'm a big AI user, a heavy one. Today, I'm going \nto show you five prompts that I'm sure will help   you with AI and crypto in 2026, and a final \none that will make your work a lot easier,   not just on AI but in your life. So, welcome to \nanother show. My name is Pedro Silva. I've been in   crypto since 2017. I'm Portuguese. I'm now a \nmentor, and usually, I do therapy sessions,   but I think for the start of the year, I \nwant to provide you with some tools. Some   cool ones that you can use to surf the 2026 \nyear in crypto and help you find long trades,   short trades, and yeah, let's see. I have \na few things that I will show you today. So, let's start immediately. Just to let you \nknow that all the models I'm going to use today,   you'll probably need a subscription. Some \nof them are free. If you have the Premium   Ticker on Twitter, it will be for free. Grok \nwill be free. That's the first one I'm going   to use. In the end, I'll share this with you. Let's say like this, it's not my masterclass,   but I think you'll like what I'm going \nto share with you. It's the list of   prompts. It's more than five prompts. You'll see it during the live stream. So, let's start with Grok. Okay, and I use \nGrok a lot, like a lot, daily. I have some   daily tasks on Grok that are automatic. Sorry. That's where I get my research. And usually,   what I do here, I have a few prompts here. One of them is the Panic Detector. I love   this one. I don't know if you remember that \nI caught this trade here. Let me try to show   you. Let me get this one. I don't know if you \nremember that I caught this. I shared with you   ZBT. It was thanks to this prompt here, the \nPanic Detector, because at the time there was   an exploit. There was something on the network, \na front-end bug, I think it was something like   this. When I went there, I started to check \nthe chart. This prompt here detected ZBT,   and that's why I got this trade. So, this is \na real example of how I used AI to make money. But let me show you. Let me run this. If \nyou want to see how the market is right now,   let's run this prompt on Grok, and you'll \nsee the result. You'll like it. In the end,   I'll show you how you can do everything in an \nautomatic way to get the results you want. So,   I'll show that in the end. The prompts will be \nin the description. Okay? But I will not leave   it now. You need to watch the live stream. You \nneed to leave your like, and only if I get like   200 likes, I'm going to leave the prompt. If not, \nyou need to screenshot and then use the prompt. So, running this now. It usually takes a \nwhile, but you will see how the market is   right now. But like I was saying, we will \nuse Grok, Gemini, and Perplexity twice,   and Claude in the end. Claude for two things. Just to show you the process. We will use Grok,   Gemini, and Perplexity for research. Claude \nwill be our analyst. It will analyze everything,   and then it will generate a report. But the \nquestion is, do you like to read reports? Because   I don't. I hate to read reports. So, I have \nsome cool things for you so that you can see how   it will make your life easier. Let's say like \nthis. Also, while we are searching—I knew this   might happen—you can use also this. For example, \nGrayscale just did a quarterly rebalance. They   talk about some tokens, and you can use any of \nthese prompts I'm going to show you to research   these tokens here. If you're not invested, if you \nare afraid of something, whatever, you can just   use the prompts I'm going to give you today to try \nto research and have it do the research for you. So, let me see. It's still waiting. In the \nend, I think it will say there's no panic. Now,   the market is so boring right now that \neven a prompt like on Grok will say that   there's no panic on the market. Let's \nsee if I'm right or not. But in the end,   everything will be here on this Google Sheet, and \nwe'll have a strong buy, strong sell, neutral,   hold, whatever."

It's still waiting. In the end, I think it will say there's no panic. Now, the market is so boring right now that even a prompt like on Grok will say that there's no panic on the market. Let's see if I'm right or not. But in the end, everything will be here on this Google Sheet, and we'll have a strong buy, strong sell, neutral, hold, whatever. We are going to build a Google \nSheet today, and you think this will be boring,   and I'll tell you it will be no boring at all. The opposite of boring. So, let me just run the   prompts so I can tell you. This is the Panic \nDetector. Like I said, I have a daily task. I   run it daily. Then I have the Scout for the Bull \nVersion. If you think the market is going bull,   if you think the market is going, whatever you \ndecide. If you think you are going to reverse,   you can use this one, and you can adapt these \nprompts. This is the Bear Version that I'm not   using yet. It's the opposite of the Scout; it \nwould look for you to sell, to short, whatever. Then we have for Perplexity and Gemini, but we \nneed the tickers first. So, what we can do right   now just to show you is to open another Grok \nwindow, and we'll run these prompts together   so you can save some time. Because I wanted to \nshow the results. I want to know who already   uses AI for their daily research in crypto \nor for crypto in general. Like I said, look,   the market is so boring. Look at this, that Grok \nis saying no sudden panic detected today. It's so   boring that no one... there's not even panic on \nthe market. Zero panic on the market right now. That's okay. The market is boring right now. It's a good thing that it's boring. But yeah,   not even a little panic. There's not \neven a little panic like we like it. So, now we can run these two. I hope these two \nwill return results, and then we can start to   use them because I have something really cool to \nshow you. That's how I do it daily for a lot of   stuff. What I'm going to show you in the end, \nyou can apply even for your work, and you'll   make your life easier. Like I said, I'm a big \nAI user, not just crypto, but in general. So,   you will see. But not having panic today. I do \nwant people to come to invest in crypto. Not even   a little emotion right now at the market. So like \nI was saying, these are the major prompts that I   use, and you can adapt these prompts. Those \nare adapted to me, to my kind of research,   to my kind of trading. That's how I use them. But \nyou can ask the model to adapt it for you. I don't   know if you ever did this, but if you go to Grok, \nClaude, Gemini, ChatGPT—if you use it, I don't   use it—and say, \"Adapt this prompt to my type of \nresearch,\" it will do it. It's super easy to do. So, let's see if we can get some coins. If not, \nI can give you an example. Let's get some coins   from here. Curve that I like, Lido, and Cardano \nbecause everyone is bearish on Cardano right   now. And let's follow this one. This is just while \nthe other one is thinking. This prompt here that   we are going to use on Perplexity. So Curve, \nADA, and Ondo. So they will do an institution   audit. So they will see who are the VCs, if \nthere are any investors that are unknown,   if they moved funds on-chain. It's a simple \nprompt, but it works really well. In the end,   it will say if there's nothing, it's retail \nonly. You just run it, and let's go. We let   this one... was super quick as you can see. We \nhave the report. And do you want to read this? Be honest. Do you like to read? I don't like \nto read this. I really don't like to read this. In the end, we can go for some tickers that \nyou like."

Be honest. Do you like to read? I don't like to read this. I really don't like to read this. In the end, we can go for some tickers that you like. So we use these. Let's use these   ones. We have Curve, ADA, and Ondo. We \ncan do again ADA and pull this one. Then   we go for another Perplexity prompt that I \nhave. Sorry, this has it. We have the Dump   Finder. We are going to run this one also in \nPerplexity. We just take this out of here. I   think you'll like the end result. But and then we \ndo this and we run it. Since we have the tickers,   we choose some. We are going to Gemini also, \nget the prompt. This will be our CTO. Gemini   was where I found ZBT also. I found it \non X, and on Gemini, and Gemini said,   \"Look, this is a good opportunity.\" Go here. Curve, ADA, and that's now going to generate. So, like I was saying, I'm a big AI user, like a \nbig one. I have a surprise for you at the end. It   will not be at the end. It will be now because \nI know that some of you are already watching,   and I want you to see this. So, we are going \nto paste the results from Gemini, Perplexity,   and Claude will analyze it. Grok is still running \nthe research. This takes some time. That's why   I'm doing this right now. Then we're going to run \nagain for Grok. But these two are still running. The bullish and the bearish one. And now let's \njust do this. Just wait a bit. This is the prompt   that will compile everything. It's the Builder. So it's like your Senior Investment Committee,   and it will do everything. It will do \neverything for you. Then we are going   to have another one. And this one, you just \ngo to Claude, you place it here, remove this,   and when you got the results... I want to \nshow you this because it's really cool. Just go here. This one's also... It's going to \nmiss X, but that's okay. You'll get everything,   and Gemini is still running the same. Now Claude \nis going to analyze everything we gave them,   and it will need time. I'm using Opus 4.5 because \nit's one of the best for me right now. I think   Grok and Claude 4.5, they are one of the best. So, \nwe are going to use Claude to give their opinion,   and then we are going to build this. And I'll show \nyou how. I'm not going to build a Google Sheet   with you live streaming, but in the end, we are \ngoing to have this built, and I'll show you how. Let's see if you have any results from... see, \nBull Version: No sleeping giant detected. Let's   see the Bearish Version: No sudden panic and \novervalued limited chance detected. This is   something that might happen. I ran these prompts \ntoday just for you, and I'll show you that. I just don't want you to see my research, my \nprevious chats. But I ran these prompts today,   and they were generating some results, and \nnow they aren't, except the Panic Detector. The Panic Detector was not detecting anything. So \nyeah, let me just try to see you. But right now,   not even for this, it's working. This is a Panic \nDetector. We don't have anything, but we are going   to use these ones. So we can adapt this and say \nrun. This is the Panic one double one. We're   going to run this for the other tokens. There's \nnothing on the market. I run this daily. Curve. So, you should have Claude still here. And \nnow we are going to do this. I'm going to   show you this. This is Claude for Chrome. Here \nyou are going to use this. This prompt here is   not there. You're going to use this prompt that \nI have here. I don't know if you ever use this   or not."

You're going to use this prompt that I have here. I don't know if you ever use this or not. And you're going to paste it here. And \nyou have two things. You can use what this did,   or you can just get the data that you \nhad, and it can do this. So you go here,   and yeah, we are going to let it \nbuild the Google Sheet for us. This will just start to do everything for \nus, and it's working. It will work for us. It will do everything. I don't \nknow if you already knew this,   but right now it's going to build everything for \nus. We won't do anything. Claude for Chrome will   work it. It's already trying to change the name \nof the Google Sheet as you can see here. And I'm   not doing anything. It will compile the search \nthat we did. See, it's already doing it here. It's already doing it here. So, if you want a \nprompt that will run something on Grok that's not   one of these, I'm going to get you one because of \ncourse, I'm prepared for these situations because   I knew this was happening. Let's do this one. It's still building it. So, let me just go here. Let's try another one. There's no panic on the   market today. Nothing. It's boring. It's \nboring. It's really boring, the market. So, let me just get this one for you. Also, tell \nme where you are watching. I want to know where   you are watching. So, let me get this. This is \nanother... This is on another library that you're   not going to have access to. But let's try this \none. This is the Deep Dive one. I like to call it   like that. We're going to run it here. And let's \nsee. See, it's building this for us. In the end,   it should say hold, buy, sell, whatever, based \non what we did here. So, let's see if it will   work or not. This is a live stream. Claude might \nmake mistakes. They're always saying that, and   it might not work, but it's doing everything for \nus. So, we just need to wait a little bit longer. And if this... I know this prompt will generate \nsomething, and then I'll share this with you. You guys just want the prompts. I'm seeing the \ncomments on X too. You just want the prompts,   but I'm not going to give you just the \nprompts. I'm going to give it later. Of course,   this will be shared with you. I'll leave a link in \nthe description, and I'll share this with you, and   I might update also. While we are waiting, let's \njust check the charts. Today, yesterday, it was a   massive... everyone was expecting that there would \nbe some tariff decision. There was some drama, and   in the end, there was nothing. It was just a big \nbluff. So, regarding Bitcoin, and just while we   wait for those things to complete, it's still on \nsupport. I'm not trading Bitcoin right now. I was   not trading Bitcoin because of the tariffs. I had \na few longs open. But right now, I'm sitting on my   hands and seeing what might happen. I want to see \nwhere the market is heading. We are seeing also   not sell pressure, but we cannot go above $94,500. So we are still ranging here. I will be a bit   careful here. I will be paying attention to what \nthe market will do. I do not believe we're going   to lose $88k, to be honest. I think we already \nwent to my target. I think I said to someone   here... I replied to a comment on X that we might \ngo to $88k-$90k. We might go there. We went there,   but right now I don't think we're going to \nlose $88k. To be honest, unless something major   happens, geopolitically speaking, I don't think \nthis is not going to hold."

To be honest, unless something major happens, geopolitically speaking, I don't think this is not going to hold. In case I'm wrong,   the next big support I'm looking around is here, \n$86k. And yeah, right now Bitcoin is ranging. It's   boring. Like I said, when you don't have panic or \nemotion on the market, it tells you everything. So, regarding Ethereum, this is the trade that I'm \nwaiting for. Hi, from Italy. From Italy. I lived   in Italy for a few months in Torino. Like I was \nsaying, I have this limit order here for $3,000   Ethereum. I have this, and I'll be patient. I don't care if I'm going to get front-run. I think Ethereum is going to go lower. If you go \nto a higher timeframe chart, it makes sense that   it goes lower. It makes sense it goes lower. So, \nprobably it will go lower, just for the $3,000,   then it can go higher. It's not financial advice, \nbut I'm buying every dip on Ethereum. Again, it's   not financial advice, but I'm buying every dip on \nEthereum. And if you start to see go here, this   is why I'm saying we might go lower. And it makes \nsense that we go lower. So, I'm waiting for the   $3,000 mark, and then I have a limit order there, \nand I'm going to long that. So this is Ethereum. Let's see our Google Sheet. Is it working right? Did any one of you use Claude for Chrome? It's   doing everything. And this is just a simple \nGoogle Sheet. It's nothing major. If you want   to use it for more complex things, you can do it. I'm not going to do it here live. I want you all   to keep your job. But this can do everything. This \ncan do everything for you. But you can see it. We gave him the results, and now it's doing this. It's much easier than reading the whole report,   than reading all of this. You don't need it. You \nhave an analyst that builds this and says CRV:   Hold. Avoid. I have ADA by the way. And \non Ondo, hold. You see how easy it was? We did this like in five minutes for the \ncurrent CRV. And if you want to do more,   just do it for the coins that you want. Now we have results. Like I told you, I   knew this one would generate results. And \nyou can do the same exercise for this one. So we'll get back to the charts. I want to run \nthis one more time so that you can understand how   this really can help you. So now that we have this \nfrom Grok, I knew this one would work. And like   I told you, I know my prompts, and I have quite a \ngood library. Let's say like this. We are going to   run it again. So we are going to use this prompt \nhere and place it here. And the results came for   five. I'm not going to read this. pump.fun and \nELF. I don't even know what ELF is. But again,   this is how I found ZBT, the trade that I just \nshowed you. So, we go here and take this. TrueFi. It's TrueFi, right? Trui pump and ELF. I think it \nwas ELF. Yeah, it's ELF. Let me just check that   TrueFi is right. It's like this. Oh, it's TRU. Yeah, it's TrueFi. So, we are going to run it,   and that's it. We are going then to do the \nsame exercise. Same here. I just want this. It didn't go there. I didn't copy them. Sorry. Okay. I'm going to run this one here. Go,   sir. And let's see the results. You are from... where is that? See, Perplexity is much quicker because we're \nnot doing deep search. If you do deep research,   you'll get better results, but I'm not going \nto do it here, otherwise, we need to be here   all day."

Just back to the charts while the prompts \nare running. And let's see this. See, doing zero,   and it's building. We just need to know this. When you are an investor, we just need this. We just need to know if you need to avoid or \nsell. Luckily, none of them are saying sell,   so we are cool. So like I was saying, here we have \nEthereum. I think we're going to touch the $3,000. I'm waiting for it. This was a trade I gave you on \nmy last live stream. I don't know if you remember   this one, but I gave you this trade here. It was \nan awesome one. Full TP, and I'm expecting that   XRP is going to retrace around these levels here. I'm still long. I have two long positions on XRP. I have one from $1.82, and then I have another \none from $2 something, and I'm waiting for it to   come lower so I can add to my position. So yeah, \nI think XRP is the coin of the moment, right? You all saw the video from CNBC. They are saying \nit's the new darling of crypto. That's all they   said. So that's how they say it's a new darling \nof crypto. So it's what it is. I don't know if you   like it or not. I'm just telling you the chart was \nan awesome trade, and yeah, we're here for this. Regarding Solana, another one that I shared \nhere on my last live stream. I think Solana   is kind of messing up with me because I'm seeing \na lot of things on-chain for Solana. Honestly,   I'm seeing a lot of things on-chain for \nSolana, but the price is not moving. So,   I think we need another meme craze \nand another meme frenzy so that people   want to get Solana again or invest \nin Solana again. Sorry. And yeah,   I'm thinking if I'm going to close this trade or \nnot. I already took some profits when it reached   resistance, of course, but I'm still thinking if \nI'm going to close it or if I'm going to take the   risk or go to break even. Because I don't like how \nit's not breaking $140. I was expecting Solana to   be above $150 right now. For some reason, it \nisn't, and I haven't found that reason yet. Regarding Curve, I'm not long right now. I have \nmy spot position, but I think if it can hold   40 cents, we might see something. We might see \nsomething going on for Curve. And it's telling   us to hold. So yeah, maybe we are not making a \nbad decision holding on Curve. So yeah, I'm going   to keep Curve 100%, and I think Curve is going to \nperform well, and I think it's close, honestly. I   think it's really close. I still have my alert \nhere at 37 cents, but that's like a three-cent   move. But I still think Curve is going to perform \nwell, and I don't think it's far to be honest. We just got the... here, and it's done. Like \nI said, we did the research. In the end,   Claude did this for us, compiled the research, \nand then... No, according to the research we did,   we don't have any unlocks. Let me do this. You can \nsee Curve, there are some governance frictions,   VCs unclear, risk no unlocks, the tech \ndevs... okay, shipping code and all. It's   the recommendation. This is not financial advice. I'm just telling you what I use daily, and if it   works for me, in theory, it should work for you. ADA... I hold ADA, but I have to agree here,   there's no major risk here, but yeah, enterprise \nhopes are fading and it's stagnant right now. So   I agree with this. And this is a recommendation \ndone by our research. Same for..."

Just one thing,   sometimes you need to verify these things. But \nnow we have a clear picture. Now if we did the   research for these coins—and like I said you \ncan run this for any coins that you want—you   have a clear picture. You can decide, okay, \nwhat's happening with this unlock from... and   then you're going to research. And the best \npart is that you didn't have to read any of   this. You didn't have to read any of this. You \njust do the research, you compile everything,   and then you get an easy way to do it because \nhere I'm just doing for three coins. But usually,   I do for my portfolio. I have a daily task like \nthis, fully automated for my portfolio so I can   know the sentiment of the coins that I hold. So just for you to be aware why I'm showing   you this today. I know you might not see a lot \nof value because it's not your coins. But if   you do this for all the coins that you have \nin your portfolio daily or weekly, whatever,   you'll know how your coins are performing. If \nyou have a red flag on any of your coins, if   there's a recommendation to buy or sell, because \nthe prompt is going to say that also. Again,   it's not financial advice. Not financial advice. But it's something that personally I did for me. So and then I'll go to analyze this and we can \ndo this one more time. So we are going to get   the prompt from Claude. You see it's easier \nto do this. You just need to go here, till   the data. It's here. Go here. Super easy to do \nthis. Get this. Come lower. You copy. I have this   all automated. So, do this. Then you go Gemini, \nthe same copy. And you're going to do for three   more tokens so you can see how it works. I don't \nknow if you hold any of this, but I hope you find   value in this because I know it might not seem a \nlot, but I know a lot of people that I'm helping   with this and now I'm giving it to you so that you \ncan use it. So, you just do this and let it run. And do it with SUI. SUI is pumping \nright now. At least it was, right? So,   I don't... SUI. Yeah, respected the support. I don't know when I did this. Probably on   some live stream on my Portuguese show, but \nyeah, you should if you speak Portuguese,   you should follow us on the Portuguese Banter. And yeah, SUI is pumping. Major pump on SUI. And there was a time I was kind of scared with \nSUI. Not I'm not holding, when I say scared is   that I was afraid that something would happen. But I think those days are gone. So let's see. And now let's check HBAR. Because this is... I'm trying to go for the trades that I shared   here. So, HBAR is another one that we did on \nthe last show. TP1 almost TP2. I'm still on   this trade and I'm still holding. I don't care \nif I got this one. I don't care if I go to break   even. There are a lot of things happening \non Solana on... sorry on HBAR. I'm mixing   both. I know one adapted the technology of the \nother one. I don't know if you know which. But a   tech... one of the two from Solana, HBAR, the \none that had Hedera Hashgraph... sorry... needed   to have something from Hashgraph. So let's say \nthis is just a joke, okay. But yeah, I'm holding   this."

But yeah, I'm holding this. I think something is coming for HBAR, and \nyeah, so I'm taking this to break even again. LINK, we've been talking about LINK since it \nwas here when I was streaming on the holidays,   and I've been telling you there was a lot of \naccumulation on-chain, and we are seeing that   again. Okay, we are seeing that again. So, I \nlike LINK. I hold LINK. And I think you should   pay attention to LINK. I'm not going to tell \nyou to buy or sell anything. I'm never going to   do that. But I think you should pay attention to \nLINK. And if you want to use any of the prompts,   like I said, I'm going to... they'll be under \nthe description of this video to search for   LINK for example, or any other coins, you can \ndo it. And if you like these type of shows,   I can tell you how to automate this, okay? And \nhow to get your portfolio... a daily portfolio   for free. Maybe you have to pay for the models \nif you use all the free tokens that you have. And then every day you wake up, you see, \nokay, this one is performing well. I have   a sell or avoid recommendation here. Why \nshould I do it? And yeah, so there you go. You go here and sorry, this is Gemini. He's \njealous of Claude. And we're going to open a   new Google Sheet. Let me just do this. And Claude \nis going to do it for us. I don't know if you can   understand this, but Claude for Chrome for me \nwas life-changing. I'll just do this and let   it go. Guys, subscribe to this channel. Leave \nsome likes. Okay, I know some of you might not   try to understand what this is. And wait, I \nforgot something. Sorry, I forgot this one. I need this here. And sorry, I was forgetting \nthis. And then let's go for this one. Let's   get... let's paste the raw data on this one. Let \nme just go here and pull this. We'll go for...   we are going to try the other way. Sometimes \nClaude for Chrome has some limitations on tokens,   on characters, sorry, that you can use, but let's \nsee, maybe it will work. I think because of the   links it might be too big, but I want you really \nto know this. There you go. And you're going to   get more than five prompts. Okay, you'll \nget more than five prompts. I can assure   you that. And I might add a few more. If you \nget a few more people subscribing and liking,   we might get a few more prompts. Maybe a trading \nprompt, maybe something that can analyze your   charts. And do not try to use Claude for Chrome \non TradingView because it's not going to work. So, while this goes, let's go look at some more \ncharts. And another one that I think it might do   well, it's XLM. I did this trade yesterday on \nthe Portuguese Banter and I'm still on it. It   almost went to stop loss, but it's okay. It's \nstill surviving the market, but like I said,   the market is boring right now. But I think \nXLM is going to perform well. Also, I think   utility coins are, how can I say this? They are \nstarting to show some interest, and the charts   are starting to look better. I think we're going \nto see Utility Season. I know that some people   might not like Dino coins and utility coins. I'm \nokay with that, but I do think it's not that far. That's what I believe. But I might be wrong. We might be in the bear market. But right now,   I do think we are going for... we might see a \nUtility Season."

But right now, I do think we are going for... we might see a Utility Season. It's not that I want to talk   about XRP today, but what they did yesterday in \nthe UK, Ripple in this case with the license,   that's utility. Okay, so they got a big financial \nlicense in the UK. I'm not going to talk about   that. But yeah, pay attention to utility \ncoins. Okay, just pay attention to that. Even AVAX, I know sometimes I joke with AVAX, \nbut I do hold AVAX, okay? AVAX might be trying   to reverse. Okay, might be trying to reverse. Of \ncourse, you need to clear this. We marked this,   you know, in the shows here on Banter. We need to \nclear it, but yeah, I think that AVAX is trying. And there's a lot of adoption on AVAX that \nI know. I can talk about that another time,   but there's a lot of adoption on AVAX. So, yeah, \nyou'll see it in the future regarding AVAX. See, it's working for us. It's doing everything. So,   still it's still really raw. But I just wanted to \nshow this one more time. But we can see TRU avoid,   pump.fun avoid, and ELF avoid. I think \nit's going to be everything to avoid,   but it's working for us. And when you start to \nuse this tool for you... Do you know how I use   this? I use it to organize my email. Just to \ngive you an idea, my email now is super clean   because of this. It's doing all the work for me. You can leave this here. I could end the stream,   go back, start a new stream, and it will still \nbe working for us and doing all the boring job of   doing Google Sheets or Excel sheets, whatever. So yeah, I think this tool is pretty cool. So another one. Let me see. Do you want me to \ncheck any coin? Someone was saying here... Gonzo   is here. Gonzo the man. Let me just check. You only ask about SUI. Someone thinks that   I believe SOL has an increase in on-chain \nreal-world assets. Maybe I'm not saying it   doesn't. I think Solana is going to perform well. It has a big... it has a lot of people supporting   Solana. So I think Solana is going to go well. I would like to find another trade for you. But   the way the market is right now, even I'm not \nactively trading. I have a few positions open. Even Convex, I told you, I don't know if you \nremember the last stream, we didn't trade Convex,   but I said, \"Look, Convex is amazing for scalps.\" And look, this was an awesome long and an awesome   short. An awesome long and an awesome short. And I stand by it. Convex is a really good coin   for you to scalp. And yeah, I do... I have \nsome Convex. I hold spot. But for trading,   you only get this type of moves. It's \nlike bananas, going up or going down,   it doesn't matter. And when it's like this, \nyou know a big move is coming. And you know   a big move is coming. So yeah, I think you'll \nfind this if you keep this on your watchlist. So it's still working on the... on \nthis one, but I think you got the idea. It's an awesome tool. I'm going to leave the \nGoogle Sheet in the description of the video   as soon as I finish the Google Doc. Sorry. I'll leave all the prompts so you can have   access at the end of the live stream. But I did \nsomething here that for you to understand how   you can improve the prompts. So you have this \none. If you want to improve any prompt to get   more in-depth for any model that you want, \njust ask the model. Let's say that I want   Gemini to improve this one. Let's select this."

If you want to improve any prompt to get more in-depth for any model that you want, just ask the model. Let's say that I want Gemini to improve this one. Let's select this. Let me just go to Gemini and start a new chat. And I'll say this, \"Help me to improve this \nprompt to use you as a tech auditor.\" You just   paste the prompt and you'll see what will do. You \ndo like this. You'll see what's going to happen. It's going to give you the prompt or you \nshould write it exactly for that model. If   you are using AI to research, see it's telling \nyou the issues. It's going to tell everything. It's going to give you more options. This was \na bonus tip for those that stayed till the end. So, like I was saying, you have these \nprompts here. If you think it's not enough,   if you like for you to use ChatGPT instead of, \nI don't know, Grok or Perplexity or whatever,   just ask chat, \"Okay, I want to use all these \nprompts, tell me how I can do it to use with   you.\" And they will generate this answer that \nyou saw here. And it's giving you several   options. It's telling you the improvements that \nyou can do. Even you can do it on Perplexity,   whatever. It's up to you. Let me see. I think it's \nalmost done. It should be doing it right now. Now,   it's going to share it. It's not going to share. And yeah, and that's it. That's how you can do   it. You have five prompts here for research. If \nyou want to know the sentiment on the market, you   can see when you run a bull and bearish prompt. For... you need to read what the prompt says. Because this is for the last 12 hours, just for \nyou to be aware, and they don't return anything,   it's because the market is boring. In \nthe bull market or even in a bear market,   there's always something happening. And if you \nrun something for the last 12 hours, it will   generate a result. For there's in the bear market, \nthere's always something that's rugging every day. In the bull market that we are right now, but \nwe are consolidating. That's like this. There's   something always pumping every day and but now the \nmarket is on expectations. So yeah, but this is   something that you can use and it's still working \non this. You understand the concept. You saw the   other one doing so. So we will go for this one. It \ndid it. It's done. It's easy to use it and I hope   you take value from this. So thank you everyone \nfor being here and see you in the next week."
