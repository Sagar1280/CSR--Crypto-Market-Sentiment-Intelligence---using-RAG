      "text": "place called Venezuela. We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition. So, we are going to run the country. >> Trump says the US is going to run Venezuela after capturing President Maduro late last night. >> The evening, tell us about it. >> It was slightly busy. I would say it was uh very dark all over, especially in Venezuela. And although there are bigger things, more important things going on in the world than Bitcoin. >> Amazing job that these people did, there's nobody else could have done anything like it. >> This is a crypto channel. That's why you subscribe to talk about how macro events affect crypto. >> But in terms of other countries that want oil, we're in the oil business. We're going to sell it to We're not going to say we're not going to get it. >> Let's talk about how this really affects Bitcoin and why the crypto market may have just flipped. watch today's whole video. >> Speaking of Venezuela oil, what are we going to do with the oil that we have? >> And Trump's been pretty clear. Actually, it's a pretty open, not so secret on one of one of the big reasons they're interested in Venezuela. >> Going to do with what? >> The oil that has been seized. The United States seized 1.9 million barrels of oil on December 10th. >> We're going to keep it. >> We're keeping it. >> Where's it? Are we going to sell it or put in the strategic? >> Maybe we'll sell it. Maybe we'll keep it. And here's the latest response from Trump just today. He said this. >> We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country. >> And I just shared this with you, but Venezuela sits on a fifth of the world's oil. They have the most gold reserves in Latin America, not to mention other rare earth minerals that China has, Russia has, the US wants. And with the US now taking control, of course, when we get a shift this big, of course, this will affect Bitcoin. This will affect crypto. Maybe not in the way you think. Let's talk about it, but really just to sum up the significance of Venezuela. I loved this clip from Amazon Prime's Jack Ryan. Listen about two minutes then I'll react. >> What [music] would you assume is the most major threat on the world stage? Anybody? Just call it out. You don't have to raise your hand. >> Definitely Russia. >> Definitely Russia. That's confident. I like it. Who says Russia? Anybody agree with her hand? Okay, great. Who else? >> China. >> Stop yelling at me, but China is a good answer. Anybody? Who else? China. >> North Korea. >> North Korea. Any North Korea takers? And uh Venezuela. Anybody? No. Oh, yep. One guy in the back. Little worried about Venezuela. Everybody's cool with Venezuela. No threat. Okay. Let me ask you this. Which one of these places can claim to have the largest oil deposit on the planet? More than Saudi. More than Iran? Wow. Okay. What about things like gold? More than all the mines in Africa combined. The fact is that Venezuela is arguably the single greatest resource of oil and minerals on the planet. So why is this country in the midst of one of the greatest humanitarian crises in modern history? >> So why did Bitcoin and crypto react positively to this hugely chaotic macro news when every other time during the last year when big macro events happened, crypto tanked? I mean, we saw this during liberation day when Trump announced for the first time reciprocal tariffs. By the way, that happened after hours on a Wednesday. So, when traditional markets, the stock market wasn't able to react because the stock market was closed. Crypto was open 24/7 and crypto tanked when the news came out. We also saw this last year when Israel attacked Iran. Huge, huge macro news, but Bitcoin tanked on the chaos news. Maduro has now arrived in New York City to be tried. I think Trump timed this capture on a weekend on purpose like we've seen him do so many other times. So the stock market won't be able to react until Monday. Yet why did Bitcoin and the bigger crypto market continue to grind up in spite of it? Well, bottoms form when sellers get exhausted. Market psychology is fascinating."

I think Trump timed this capture on a weekend on purpose like we've seen him do so many other times. So the stock market won't be able to react until Monday. Yet why did Bitcoin and the bigger crypto market continue to grind up in spite of it? Well, bottoms form when sellers get exhausted. Market psychology is fascinating. A true bottom often forms only after diehard holders who swore they never sell. Finally capitulate in despair liquidating positions and declaring utter indifference to whatever happens next. Bottoms form when sellers are done. They're exhausted. Meaning bottoms form when sellers get exhausted just like tops form when buyers get exhausted. buyers got exhausted at 120,000 Bitcoin 1 2 3 four different times price had to correct. Are the sellers exhausted now? Well, we see this. This is data from just the last week. Traders are still longing the selloff with leverage and getting liquidated. Meaning maybe indifference hasn't quite hit yet, but indifference is getting close. And again, when complete indifference, complete boredom show up in markets, that's another clear indicator of when bottoms form. So traders are still longing the sell-offs with leverage and then getting liquidated. Meaning, you long the sell-off and then you get liquidated as we correct again, watching for them to give up, flip short, and get liquidated on the short side. This is the bottoming process, and we're slowly cleansing out the market. 22% to 17% to 8% markets will flip just like we saw earlier this year when we clear the leverage and then the shorts get liquidated pushing price higher and just like we saw back in April with liberation day where the sellers got exhausted and we rallied from it. We're starting to see that again. Bottoms take months or even years to form. And where are we today? Well, we're about 4 [snorts] months. Feels like just yesterday, but we are four months into this bottoming process. Bottoms take months or even years to form. You always get multiple attempts. Many were trying to buy every dip, worried that the price Bitcoin would take off without them. But now that we've had we have a long period of consolidation, nobody wants to buy anymore. So, it's really not just that sellers get exhausted, but you get a box of despair. You get indifference. You get a box of despair. you get indifference. This was one of the biggest shows of forces to the world from the United States on Venezuela which now the US is running and the crypto market was indifferent. In fact, we grinded higher. Now, by the way, I am not a financial adviser. I cannot see the future. You click subscribe for perspective, but then you make your own decisions. Just use today's video as a jumping off point. And it feels like this rally will continue at least up to the 50week moving average because really while the bottoming process started four months ago, the bare market officially from a technical perspective started when we broke under and then confirmed that break under the 50we moving average. Are the crypto sellers truly now exhausted? I've been in crypto for over eight years. I've been through many bull markets. I've been through multiple bare markets and I believe there will be a percentage of crypto holders that will sell into the cross or the touch of the 50week moving average. How many of you wish you just would have got out of crypto at least got out of some of the altcoins back when Bitcoin was above 100K? Well, as we do this bounce back up to the 50we moving average, right now it's about 101. Maybe in a week or two it'll be at 99 100. That's when traders or more of the weak hands choose to take profits in their positions, cut losses, just put it in to maybe just put it in Bitcoin or maybe take it off the table, consolidate and then move forward. And in my video from the other day, top six crypto altcoins to invest in for 2026. Of course, I was not saying go buy these altcoins today."

I'm just always speaking from me what I do with my money. highly recommend you watch this video if you haven't really significant but I would venture to guess because we have not retested this old support this old support which has now become resistance I would suspect having been in markets for for many many years this will be the ultimate test and really the biggest wash out of are the sellers exhausted a test a rejection a retest again that will be the key obviously this is an ongoing story the minute I get new information that affects you, that affects crypto. I will make a video, keep you informed. Click the like button if you feel you got value today and share it with a friend. It really helps the channel. It's completely free. And like always, see you"
