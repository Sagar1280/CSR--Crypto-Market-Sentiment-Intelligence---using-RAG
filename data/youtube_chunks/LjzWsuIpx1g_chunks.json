      "text": "If you are a crypto investor, there are two big stories today that you want to talk about. The first one is the headlines around Zcash where their entire development team has left. The main developers have quit. Those are the headlines. If you look at the charts on Zcash, it has gone down about 20% in the last 24 hours. The next big headline is tomorrow because the Supreme Court rules as to whether Trump's tariffs were actually legal. If Trump's tariffs are not illegal, then what is that actually going to do to the market? Remember, tomorrow is Friday and you know what happens on Fridays with big news. Today is almost like a two for the price of one. There is the Zcash news and I am going to break it down for you concisely and slowly. I am going to show you whether it is an opportunity today or whether you should be selling all your Zcash. Then we are going to talk about the Trump tariffs and the Supreme Court ruling to decide whether or not it can actually move markets tomorrow and how you should prepare yourself. Let's get the show on the road. Never a dull day if you are a crypto investor. If you are still a crypto investor, let me know in the chat because it feels like a lot of crypto investors have left. They have given up. The sideways chop has knocked them down. At some stage, we are going to have a discussion as to whether we are in a bear market or whether there is an uptrend ahead of us or whether this is just a correction. Today is a big day and we need to talk about the big news of the day and the big news which is going to happen tomorrow. The big news of today undoubtedly is this Zcash story where effectively their developers have all just resigned. The big question here is whether this is true or whether this is FUD and whether you should actually be buying the dip. I am going to break that down for you because I have got a lot of inside scoop. I have spoken to a lot of insiders and I can tell you exactly what is going on today and then we will talk about the Trump tariffs.

When you hit the like button, it gives energy to the algorithm and really helps the distribution of the show. I am waiting for the likes, guys. Let's talk about the first stories first. Zcash and this morning, investors woke up to these headlines. Zcash developers quit, form new company after board clash. Privacy coin Zcash sinks 20% after core developer team quits. Zcash's main developers walk out without warning. Zcash faces its biggest test yet. This is what the chart looks like. The chart, if we looked at Zcash two days ago, it was at $500. Now it is 20% down trading at exactly $400. It was as low as $377 on the news today. Where did this news actually come from? Well, it comes from this tweet from a guy called Josh Swihart. He says over the past few weeks, it has become clear that the majority of the Bootstrap board members have moved into clear misalignment with the mission of Zcash. He says yesterday, the entire Electric Coin Co. team left after being constructively discharged. In short, the terms of our employment were changed in a way that it made it impossible for us to perform our duties effectively and with integrity. We are founding a new company, but we are still remaining with the same mission. Josh is the former CEO of Electric Coin Co. and today I am going to break down for you whether this is an opportunity or whether this is just a whole lot of FUD. In order for you to understand that, you need to understand the history of Zcash. Zcash is a proof of work network like Bitcoin except that it is private. It was created almost as a faster, cheaper, and compliantly private version of Bitcoin. It was created by a bunch of founders including a guy called Zooko. He created the Zcash protocol through a company called Electric Coin Co. This was the founders' company set up to develop the Zcash protocol. Fast forward to today, the Zcash protocol is running and has the support of big names. Naval Ravikant is a big supporter. Arthur Hayes is a big supporter. Mert is a big supporter. The Winklevoss brothers are big supporters. A lot of the old Bitcoin cypherpunk movement seem to have taken on this new challenge of creating private money, which is where Bitcoin has basically failed us because Bitcoin is not really private. It is anonymous because of addresses, but ultimately the on-chain sleuths have tracked back lots of the transactions. Effectively, Zcash is private Bitcoin. Remember I said to you that this protocol was developed in this"

It is anonymous because of addresses, but ultimately the on-chain sleuths have tracked back lots of the transactions. Effectively, Zcash is private Bitcoin. Remember I said to you that this protocol was developed in this company called Electric Coin Co. and it is a proof of work protocol. In a proof of stake protocol, the tokens are pre-issued and given to investors. In a proof of work protocol, the tokens only get released every time a block is mined. Similar to Bitcoin, the tokens don't exist until they are mined. With a proof of stake protocol like Ethereum, tokens are held by the foundation and the foundation sells those tokens to develop the protocol. With a proof of work protocol, you can't do that because you don't have pre-mined tokens. So Zcash had this mechanism where 80% went to the miners, 5% went to the foundation, and 7% went to Electric Coin Co. to carry on funding the development of wallets and other applications. For the longest time, Zooko was part of Electric Coin Co., although he did leave in December 2023 and he started a new company also building on the Zcash protocol. Here is where it gets messy. In November 2024, the system changed. The new change said that of every block mined, 80% goes to the miners, 8% goes to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG), and 12% goes into a lockbox. A lockbox is exactly what it sounds like. Every block that is mined, the tokens go into a box which is locked until they can agree what to do with the money. Originally, Electric Coin Co. was getting 7% of every single block and now they are not getting anything. Where is the money going? It is going into a lockbox. As of November 2024, there is no disbursement mechanism currently defined. The Zcash community will need to decide upon a suitable decentralized mechanism for permitting withdrawals. Now you are starting to see where the problem is. Electric Coin Co., which was building so many applications, all of a sudden is not automatically getting the money. The founder, Zooko, left Electric Coin Co. and Josh Swihart took over as CEO. He and a bunch of developers decided to donate their shares to a nonprofit organization called Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a nonprofit organization meant to hold the shares in Electric Coin Co. What seems to have happened is that Bootstrap, operating under strict legal and fiduciary obligations, had conflict with the team regarding external investment and an alternative structure to privatize Zashi, the wallet. The team of developers basically said they couldn't"

What seems to have happened is that Bootstrap, operating under strict legal and fiduciary obligations, had conflict with the team regarding external investment and an alternative structure to privatize Zashi, the wallet. The team of developers basically said they couldn't work under all these restrictions and they weren't getting paid or receiving grants anyway. So they left. As Mert says, Zcash did not lose anything. The Electric Coin Co. team did not like their board, so they started the exact same company with a different name and no board, meaning they are now unburdened by the politics. This whole thing is a nothing burger. They didn't like the board, they weren't getting money from the protocol anyway, and they started a new company to carry on developing without the bureaucracy. The core devs are not gone. Electric Coin Co. is just one part of the Zcash development community. There is Shielded Labs, the Zcash Foundation, and Project Techon. All of those remain independent. Nothing has really changed. This would have been a massive concern if the Zcash developers were being paid by the protocol and all of a sudden they lost their funding. They weren't getting funding anyway. This is a retail dump based on headlines. We know that there are big names involved here, like Tyler Winklevoss. He is retweeting messages saying no one from Zcash has quit and the team is more aligned than ever. Tyler Winklevoss is highly incentivized for Zcash to work because he runs a digital asset treasury company that buys Zcash. If you were responsible for millions of dollars and your mission was Zcash, would you amplify a message that was bad for the protocol? It doesn't make sense. Retail is waking up to these headlines and in a low liquidity market, headlines can scare. But after hours of analysis and speaking to insiders, this Zcash thing is a nothing burger. Nothing has changed except that the devs have moved from one structure where there was a hostile board to another structure. If you were bullish before, nothing has changed. Let's talk about the other big news which can affect the markets tomorrow. Trump's tariffs are on the line tomorrow because the Supreme Court could rule as to whether the tariffs were legal or illegal. This is a complicated case because Trump charged about $150 billion in tariffs. In financial year 2025, total tariffs were $216 billion, but some were there before. The Supreme Court tomorrow may come out with a ruling. There was skepticism from the justices during arguments in November. It is possible we see a split decision where some tariffs are"

The Supreme Court tomorrow may come out with a ruling. There was skepticism from the justices during arguments in November. It is possible we see a split decision where some tariffs are upheld and others struck down. The argument comes down to whether or not Trump is allowed to increase tariffs without Congress's approval. There is a law called IEEPA that gives the president certain powers in cases of economic emergencies. It says the president may \"regulate importation.\" Do those words mean tariffs? Can the president impose tariffs even though the Constitution gives that power to Congress? Polymarket currently says there is a 24% chance they will rule in favor of Trump's tariffs, meaning a 76% chance they will be deemed illegal. If they are illegal, will Trump have to pay the $150 billion back? Who do you pay it back to? Importers who paid the tariffs are taking Trump to court to try and get their money back. We may or may not hear the final answer tomorrow. Even if they rule it unconstitutional, Trump may find another way to make them constitutional. Why are we talking about this today? Because tomorrow is Friday and news on a Friday in low liquidity risks a market overreaction. This whole story comes down to whether that revenue was earmarked for stimulus checks. I don't think we will get a final answer tomorrow, but beware of low liquidity. All right, we have another winner in our Cast card competition.
