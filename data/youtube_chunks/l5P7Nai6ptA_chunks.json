      "text": "Most people forget this now, but for years, crypto felt [music] like trying to unlock a door [snorts] with the wrong key. You'd hear the buzz, Bitcoin, [music] blockchain, then hit a wall of confusion. Too many platforms, too many risks, one wrong move, and your money gone. That's where the story of 21 Shares [music] begins. Not in some flashy boardroom, but in a living room. Two founders, one simple question. How do you help the people you care about step into the future safely without fear? >> They were looking for an easy way for their mothers to invest in Bitcoin. And back then they yeah quickly found out that it's pretty hard to get exposure, especially if you're more a traditional investor. >> That question didn't just start a company. It sparked a mission to make crypto safe, simple, and accessible for everyone. From that living room, 21 shares would go on to launch the world's first physically backed crypto ETPs, expand across Europe, the Middle East, and the US, and build a global platform rooted in regulation and reliability. They never tried to be the everything in finance. They chose to master one thing, safe access to digital assets. We at 21 shares we have a almost 8year long track record. Um and all we do is crypto ETPs and ETFs. So that's solely what we focus on. >> And that focus matters most when markets break because crypto doesn't test companies during the quiet months. It tests them during chaos. But I think when the market is really under stress or we have a major black swan event for instance, that's really when uh when it's a moment to shine and that's when you see the difference on how those issuers uh manage their risk in [music] the back end. That's the part most people never see, the operational work that keeps products stable, compliant, and functioning when the systems get very volatile. And that's where years of crypto only experience shows up. And for many people stepping into the space for the very first time, that experience removes the fear completely. >> Of course, the beauty is that with an ETP or an ETF, you basically buy it as just like any other stock like any other ETF. You have your existing brokerage account. You type in an ice um and you get exposure. You don't have to worry about private keys. You don't have to worry about a separate account. Even taxes are easier. >> That's why 21 Shares exists. To take something powerful, chaotic, fastm moving, and turn it into a safe, clear path for anyone ready to explore, learn, and invest in their future. Today we're joined by Adrien Fritz, chief investment strategist from 21 Shares and one of the minds who translates the entire industry into clear, actionable insight for people stepping into it. He takes us inside the 21 Shares story, where it began, how the team operates, and what it takes to build the infrastructure that supports millions of new investors entering digital assets for the first time. [music] Stay with us because this conversation reveals how crypto becomes accessible [music] at a global scale and the team quietly engineering that transformation. [music] Quick disclaimer guys, this video is forformational and educational purposes only and does not constitute financial or investment advice. Always do your own research and of course consult a licensed financial adviser before making investment decisions. And one more personal note for those of you who know me, you guys know that I personally advocate for self-custody. if you're confident in managing it properly. That means understanding how to protect your keys, how to set up wallets, avoid critical mistakes, exchange your fiat for Bitcoin, use exchanges, and take full responsibility for your assets. But here's why I'm sharing this interview. I still have friends and family who are curious about Bitcoin, Ethereum, all of it. But the complexity holds them back. They want in, but they're scared [music] to make the wrong move. So, even if you're not the right fit for a product like [music] 21 Shares, maybe someone that you care about is because years from now, the worst thing to hear is, \"I wanted to buy back then. I just didn't know how.\" And I've heard that way too many times. [music] All right, guys. Without further ado, let's dive into this. Let's welcome Adrian to the stage. Adrian, welcome to the channel. Great to have you here. How you doing? I'm I'm doing great, Ka. Thanks for having me. >> Yeah, my absolute pleasure. Uh excited for this. Can you give those watching kind of an introduction to, you know, who who is 21 Shares?"

Can you give those watching kind of an introduction to, you know, who who is 21 Shares? And I hear there's some sort of kind of very personal story behind the way it came to be and uh yeah, what do you guys do? >> No, absolutely. I mean uh 21 shares we are a global ETF and ETP provider for uh crypto. Um and yeah what we basically do and the value proposition that we offer is that we make it very accessible especially for traditional investors to get exposure to crypto. Um and yeah I mean the story as you mentioned it kind of all started almost eight years ago. um our two co-founders they came together uh they both yeah met in Stanford where they studied and actually they were looking for an easy way for their mothers to invest in Bitcoin >> and back then they yeah quickly found out that it's pretty hard to get exposure especially if you're more a traditional investor and that's how they came up with the idea of launching ETPs or uh ETFs um they've been looking around the globe where to settle first and yeah, they start building their business in Switzerland because it was the most forward-looking regulation. Um, and yeah, we are a Swiss-based, born and raised in Switzerland. Uh, we in 2018, we launched the world's first physically backed uh crypto basket ETP uh as well as the world's first physically backed Bitcoin ETP. And since then, we've been Yeah. kind of expanding around the globe. We h now have over 50 products in Europe. Uh we expanded to Australia, the UK, to the Middle East, and of course since beginning last year, we also um have ETFs in the US. So, it's been quite a wild journey. >> I'm curious if uh so did you what year did you get that Bitcoin ETP established? >> 2018. >> Okay. So, uh, how long after it was established did the co-founder's, um, mother's, uh, deposit? >> I think right away, basically. >> So, what what month was that approximately? >> But that I don't know to be really honest what exact month that was. Yeah. >> If it was if it was later in 2018, they'd be in a really good position right now if they uh, >> you know, that's [laughter] >> I think they're in a good situation nonetheless, right? If you invested in 2018, if you huddled through, >> uh, it should be quite nicely even though it hurts right now looking at the charts. >> Yeah. But I mean, yeah, exactly. Even even if it was a top and, you know, late 2017, early 2018, that's still 19K at the top. But if they bought anytime later in 2018, they very, very, very good returns. And uh I'm glad that they they were able to do that, you know, for my my mom. Uh in 2015, I got her to cuz so I've been in Bitcoin since 2012. And you know, just trying to show this to my parents as hard as possible. >> There was a a time when one of the um core Bitcoin developers uh his name was Mike Hearn. He put out a a blog post and he was one of the core respected developers of Bitcoin. Um, and he basically came out with this very negative post saying that, you know, Bitcoin's over. It's a failed experiment. It's never going to work, blah blah blah blah. And I think that as soon as he dropped that post, we had, it was a huge sell-off. And I know that Bitcoin got down to like 180 bucks. And I literally like physically went to my dad's house, physically went to my mom's house and said, \"You guys have to buy Bitcoin right now.\" you know, and uh and just like it was the the biggest sense of urgency, you know, I've they probably I've ever seen me."

And uh my dad just didn't. And then my mom tried to so she, you know, the way she does, she got on like Coinbase and tried to transfer, but then she couldn't figure it out and then so she never did it, right? then but eventually in 2015 uh she was able to through Fidelity roll her uh Bitcoin IRA into or her sorry normal IRA into Bitcoin and that was really cool. So I definitely empathize and think that's an awesome story. >> But but Kyle, let me ask you what what was your investment pitch back then to your dad? Like how how how would you want to convince him to to give you money to invest in Bitcoin? >> Well, I wanted him to invest his own money in Bitcoin. I I already I already had a like, you know, >> I already had a lot uh by then. Um but I wanted him to to to have some even if it was just a small amount, but at 180 bucks, he could have spent five grand and like been set today, you know. >> Uh >> but I I don't remember what the pitch was. It was probably I probably explained something like they didn't understand it uh for the longest time even when I first got into it and then but I had been really like bothering people around me to where like I almost felt like that um pyramid sales guy right where like you start like like the only way to make money try to sell your friends a product and they're like after a while they stop responding to your calls and stop you know like they're like dude just stop trying to sell me this thing you know and uh so I had to to back off a little bit but but by that time I really encouraged him the sales pitch was probably just like like dad this has just happened like this really important person in the industry uh said something negative uh he's definitely wrong we have a huge price correction and I think that you should really take whatever free cash you have around and you know at least put some of that into Bitcoin right now um something like that >> that's that's that's an amazing story because my Bitcoin journey started in a similar fashion I would Okay. Uh I also found Bitcoin in 2011 12. I was still a student back then and one of my best friends, he was a computer science uh student and he was just very curious. I don't know browsing around the web, the dark web and that's where we basically bumped into Bitcoin. Um so I read about it and I was like okay it's limited supply. So, it was very intriguing and I also approached my stepdad back then and I was like, \"Hey, listen. There's this digital currency. It's limited in supply and more and more people need it. We should buy some.\" Um, and Bitcoin was at around $250. Um, but I never invested any money whatsoever. So, I kept on watching it and I kept on sending screenshots to him. until eventually when Bitcoin was at around $800, he sent me a bit of money, I invested it and a few weeks later the entire market just absolutely crashed and I lost 80%. >> I sold I panic sold. I panic sold. Uh I think I lost 80%, I gave him back uh the remaining 20%. And back then he told me, \"I told you so. You shouldn't be investing in some weird magic internet money.\" Um, but yeah, that was kind of the start of this love of hate situation with Bitcoin."

It was definitely the reason why I studied finance, why I got hooked on financial markets, um, and eventually started working in crypto as well. Yeah, it's amazing how Bitcoin gets brought to you by your friend or something or YouTube channel that you watch or something like that and initially it's positioned at least from my experience a lot of well maybe not my circle because I I I really grew up around once I got into it like I also discovered it in 2012 also from the dark web also the place that most early people uh learned about it you know but don't don't say it publicly right like um yeah so I but and that's the point where I like I understood um just the first time I ever learned about the dark web and what it was and the whole thing that whole experience >> blew my mind like what this is this eBay and it takes this Bitcoin and like it's anonymous like what what's going on right now how come I can see this marketplace and no and uh and like it's it's still up like I didn't understand any of it that but uh it got me to like be aware of it and then by 2013 I became very aware ware of it. And it's interesting how, you know, it takes a lot of people from this path of like really having no idea how the monetary system works, the debasement of the of the fiat currencies, um, to really starting to understand like why this is significant. And then for a lot of people, it takes them far beyond that and they go down that rabbit hole of of, you know, Bitcoin versus gold and, you know, how the money machines actually work and, you know, these kind of things. And so uh just the initial introduction maybe it's from a trader who says hey we should trade this thing to someone who's actually like believes in long-term and wants to hold for a long period of time. So I mean it's the in my opinion it's the best asymmetric rest risk that anyone can get their hands on uh still today. I still think today it's it's the best asymmetric risk for capital growth or preservation uh from anything else. I, you know, unless you get really super lucky and buying the next Nvidia, uh, you know, a day a couple days after IPO and looks like a company that just makes, uh, accelerated cards for computer games, you know, I didn't realize so valuable in the future, but >> but yeah, so um, yeah, good big good background. Very very similar except for uh I didn't I didn't I wasn't trading. I didn't sell mine, but I I spent a lot of it because remember I didn't have any uh I was then an aspiring entrepreneur. Um and I didn't spend anything. I I spent a lot of bitcoin trying to grow businesses, right? I was just like at much lower prices. And my own version of the of the uh the pizza story is you know I have I bought a Harley for myself for my birthday in 2015 and it was uh 14 and a half bitcoin. So yeah, but you know like I wanted to go buy that Harley with Bitcoin. Like I I wanted to like really kind of live in that life and you know looking back I think that uh like I have a much lower net worth than I would have had I hodddled everything. But I love the experiences that I've gone through and just that that kind of life story that's being told from all of these experiences that allowed me to do. So yeah. So for the long term really really good hold."

So for the long term really really good hold. I guess that makes me come to a kind of natural question here is we're seeing a lot of outflows right now from you know the ETFs and I'm curious like what kind of like what kind of onboarding do when when you guys get someone that comes and says hey I'm interested in exploring this Bitcoin ETP or ETF. Um you know can you tell me some more about it? Like do you and then also like what what mix of customer is it? Is it institutions? Is it just like high high net worths? Is it just accredited investors with a little bit of money? Um so yeah like is the onboarding experience an educational one where you say hey look like it's very volatile and show them market cycles in the past and say like the you know I can't like maybe you guys can make financial advice. I don't know if you're financial adviserss or not, but like you know like expect volatility and try to remain calm because look at the history and it's expected and it's you know that kind of thing because my assumption right now is that a lot of the outflows are coming from more the the tourists, right? The people who like >> maybe they're not the institutions who've done an epic amount of research before putting billions of this into this stuff and they know about it, they expect it, they're fine with it and they're still holding through it versus ETF outflows we're seeing right now. maybe they're coming from more newer participants, uh, people who just kind of winged it. What are your thoughts on that? >> I I think you hit it on a nail when you said it's it's mostly educational. Um, but I would say it changed slightly over the last couple years. Um when I started at 21 shares I would say yeah the majority of of clients were as you mentioned high netw worth individuals uh some accredited investors a lot of family offices because they are usually a bit more nimble and they can take quicker investment decisions and they're open to to to new technologies like that. but then also kind of like private banking, independent asset managers. Um, but yeah, and of course a big amount of retail uh that still invests in these uh ETPs and ETFs. >> The journey in regards to onboarding 100% all about education. Um, >> and it gotten better, but you would be surprised how many people are still at the ver very early innings of their crypto journey. Um, and it takes a lot of patience, but you really got to take them by their hand and help them navigate through this new asset class. And that comes with explaining what a blockchain is, explain why Bitcoin was created in the f first place, how it works, its monetary policy. Then of course face a lot of the misconceptions that are still there to a lesser extent, but they're still there kind of like it's only used for criminal activity. um it it it can be hacked uh all these kind of classic FAQs um that we need to address on a daily basis. Uh the good thing and the very rewarding thing about this job is that usually if people are intelligent um and they spend a bit of time educating themselves at one point they start to crack and a lot of times they do a 180 as well. So I have plenty of examples where we met clients four years ago. We spoke to them on a bianual basis and this year they finally made an education. But the first time we met them they were like super skeptical. >> They maybe just took the meeting out of courtesy."

But the first time we met them they were like super skeptical. >> They maybe just took the meeting out of courtesy. Um but over the years they really started to appreciate this uh this new asset class. what percentage of your clients right now in Bitcoin ETPs or FS uh what's the client mix right now approximately you know what percent in in retail what percent uh in corporations or you know big big institutions and then uh I guess we could say family offices maybe but I'm not I'm trying to understand the mentality behind the customers and just the ratio the weight of how much each on hold. >> Yeah. Yeah. I would say it's around it's still the majority is retail. I would say 70% retail, 30% um >> Wow. 70% retail >> leaning towards institutional investors. >> I know that over the last year we seen some bigger announcements by pension funds by some sovereign funds but also uh for instance university endowments. Um I think it was a big surprise that Harvard for instance they increased their Bitcoin allocation and it's now actually their biggest holding. So the institutional adoption is clearly ticking up but as of today it's still mainly retail driven. >> Wow. >> Another another big segment that I would point out are just hedge funds. So there's been a yeah a a a trading opportunity um called the basis trade. basically capturing um uh the the the premium on the future market. So what a lot of people do is they they short the CME um while using ETFs for the long leg and like this they're able to capture quite junky yields uh on a deltaneutral basis. Um and you see that if this basis contracts you see major outflows and redemptions because those hedge funds retreat. Yeah, I see that right now. I always just check Vel uh.xyzradfi to check. We're looking at like BTC CME annualized basis premium, right? Versus and uh >> and that's so they're basically trying to beat the risk-free reward, right? The risk rate which is treasuries and stuff. >> Exactly. Exactly. >> So right now the premium's at 6.7%. Uh, and I guess that that you can get a lot of closer to risk-free things around 5% or so. Five 5.5 maybe. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, at times this this this premium was above 10% and then you you see a lot of creations because then it makes economically sense. It's it all comes down to opportunity cost. Uh, but you're 100% right. Uh, that's basically how they weigh the the the pros and cons. Yeah, I talk a lot that about that a lot on the channel as far as usually when we see ETF flows coming up a lot or out a lot. It's uh >> it's a huge indicator of exactly what's happening. It's those basis trades. How do you deal with potential customers that are shopping around the same way that you know one person might be looking at a bit a bunch of different car manufacturers but they all kind of have their like basic model their premium whatever they and when you talk to someone that's interested that says hey I've checked out you know these other issuers too and you know some this is what I like what I didn't like blah blah blah like how do you tell them that what what do you say about 21 shares that differentiates you versus the others? >> [snorts] >> That's a very good question and it certainly has become more competitive um especially over the last few years because obviously we now have big traditional heavy weights in the ring as well um and therefore this question pops up quite a lot. So, how are we different from from like those traditional asset managers? And I would argue that we at 21 shares, we have a almost 8y year long track record."

Um, and all we do is crypto ETPs and ETFs. So, that's solely what we focus on. And from the outside, if you look at uh on screen and you're trying to buy an ETF, you might not see the nuances that go into it. Uh but managing these things and crypto assets from an operational level, um it can be very challenging. So just to give you some examples for instance and you won't see that um on screen um and that's a big difference to to to to equities as well. Let's assume something happens with a Tesla car for instance uh or internally usually it doesn't really affect the security or the stock aside from maybe some price movement and volatility. If anything happens to the underlying blockchain, it directly impacts the security or the ETF. Um, the best examples are we've seen migrations, we've seen forks, there are airdrops, there are a bunch of corporate actions that have to be dealt with in the back end. And I would say we we clearly have the best track record when it comes to that. Um just to name an example when the Ethereum merge happened for instance um of course we had a a split a fork into Ethereum and then Ethereum proof of work but you were also eligible for an airdrop in E P token. So what we basically did um within 24 hours we we do work together with multiple custodians um but one specific custodian he supported the airdrop. So what we did is we moved all the asset to that specific custodian. We claimed the airdrop and we moved it back to the original place all within 24 hours. Um and therefore we were able to claim the airdrop, sell it off and gave the the ETF performance or the ETP performance an additional boost. >> Um and this boost was between over 1.5% which basically paid for your management fee. Um >> and I know that's very nerdy and geeky when it comes uh to to the operational back end, but I think that's truly where we have the experience uh and expertise. Yeah, that's pretty interesting because I I I I do remember that there were some other instances I think uh in the past where you had these situations with either exchanges or I don't even know if what when when was that again? That was like it was before US ETFs were around. Yeah, obviously that was but I think it was with exchanges or something like that and some of them >> uh did distribute the the airdrops or the the fork to the users and some of them didn't and I and you know that that tells a big difference about >> kind of the you know the customer care and also fairness of of you know what's going on and also >> absolutely >> also if that's what the platform is willing to do then uh >> you know there's obviously an intent to do what's best for the customers. >> 100% 100% and I think it's becoming more and more important especially now that we see a plethora of old coins uh flooding the market. Um and of course in Europe we've been having those those kind of products for for over half a decade and therefore we already built the track record how to manage those. Um and it's very definitely the little things. I mean staking for instance is another big uh feature that needs to be handled and it comes down to risk and liquidity management. Um because think about it for Ethereum for instance there's an entry and exit queue."

Um because think about it for Ethereum for instance there's an entry and exit queue. So, let's say you you you basically can't really stake 100% of the assets because you always got to make sure there's enough liquidity to guarantee redemptions um if there's a large sell order hitting the market. Um and those yeah, those have to be managed in the back end basically and different issuers take different approaches. Are you guys already doing staking in uh with with like Ether Salana? >> Uh yes, in Europe we've been doing it for for uh many many years. Uh we have a bunch of different staking products. Um and that's why kind of we definitely built this operational excellence and and know how to deal with it. Uh and of course the good thing now is that we can carry over this expertise to the to the US market. Um, I know when it comes to branding, we have a lot to do. That's why we want to put our name out there, but when it comes to the operational experience, um, I think we can definitely definitely uh, play along. for a product like Bitcoin. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like a very apples to apples kind of like, okay, I give you cash, you give me, you know, claims to Bitcoin shares or whatever, and then like I redeem them when I feel like it. And there's not much active management happening as far as I can tell on that side. like it's a it's the equivalent now of um you know like a new Bitcoin treasury company trying to compete with Sailor or something versus you know the Gen 2 uh DATs that are you know now working with ETH and Salana and things like that that can earn revenue. I guess from a a layman they would probably look at this situation and say well cool you guys have done like isn't isn't staking ETH uh kind of very similar across the boards and once the US uh is fully open for it um I see like all these other issuers like Black Rockck and Fidelity and others and and you guys also is pending on on the status of that staking but once it's open and good uh is there really that much of a difference in how you manage those stakes uh that that benefit the clients. Uh and what what maybe you can just say kind of the things that you've learned or uh how you think maybe two examples of like a company that's just staking and and just making sure they have enough reserves versus someone who's actively managing and attempting to outperform the other competitors. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean I mean the big issue there's not really a standard um on how to deal with those things. That's why every issuer has basically their own approach um when it comes to comes down to liquidity management but also risk management for staking. Um I think in layman like if [laughter] you look at it from the outside as a normal investor you don't really see the difference and usually when markets are normal when they're going sideways when they consolidate or when we in a bull market everything is fine as always but I think when the market is really under stress or we have a major black swan event for instance that's really when uh when it's the moment to shine and that's when you see the difference on how those issuers uh manage their risk in the back end. Um so yeah, I think in the long run maybe some other issuers they provide better yields um on paper and it's all good uh because we're in a bull market or we just going sideways. But when uh hits the fan then definitely uh we we we we might see who has a better risk management."

But when uh hits the fan then definitely uh we we we we might see who has a better risk management. >> Yeah. Okay. So te tell us a bit about the other kind of products that you know anyone watching this can go check out like you you were telling me before that you guys have uh research that people can read and access and is there anything else uh they should be aware of? >> No. Uh of course research is a a core pillar of our business. Um once once again usually that's how we we help those traditional investors find their way into into digital assets. Um and also when it comes to research it really depends who you are talking to. Um it's important to adjust the pitch, adjust the language. Uh it's quite funny a lot of time if you sit on those meetings um maybe you sit in front of an asset manager uh the head off is super skeptical but they might be bringing their junior because it's really enthusiastic about about crypto uh and they start asking very challenging questions very technical so you got to be able to answer those um but other times it's just a private banker for instance and you got to keep it very high level and simple. Um, and other times it might be a portfolio manager that usually don't really care about the underlying tech. They just want to see how it fits in my portfolio and what the what the diversification benefits are. So, um, yeah, I think when you check out our research, we we we definitely provide a a variety of uh different angles to make sure we we we serve the space. Aside from our products, once again, of course, we uh we've also just launched uh Solana in the US. We have uh Bitcoin and Ethereum. We also have baskets now. Basically, for instance, the top 10 um that should get easy exposure uh ranked by or basically the methodology is just by market cap. Um and beyond that, of course, our European offering is way way bigger here. We also have a uh a big breath of altcoin offerings um from unis swap toondo to canon um or some other multi asset baskets that are that are quite interesting. >> Yeah, those are very interesting and I think eventually those will probably be the most dominant ones. those indexes people like >> absolutely >> absolutely we have we have in in Europe one product without mentioning the ticker of course but like we we we're combining Bitcoin and gold um because >> of course there's a lot of whispers it kind of like Bitcoin is the better gold or yeah just Bitcoin versus gold but we actually think they have a beautiful symbiosis the two of them and if you combine them because they're have a very low correlation to each other, you have the most liquid alternative assets on the market. Um, and if you put them together, they perform quite uh quite nicely. >> I think that's a really uh really interesting idea. I I would buy it. I would buy it for sure. >> Yeah. So, okay. So, now that uh I mean basically we have a good overview of 21 shares. Uh just can you explain to the audience because I believe Last time I looked at the analytics, about 50% are American. I think uh some other high percentages from the UK and another third highest would be Australia and then like the rest from everywhere else. So how how does anyone like can anyone from any jurisdiction participate in any of your products or do they have to go to uh you know jurisdiction uh individual kinds of routes of Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't I wouldn't say there's a there's a there's a perfect answer to that, but generally speaking, you can only access those products in your jurisdiction."

I wouldn't I wouldn't say there's a there's a there's a perfect answer to that, but generally speaking, you can only access those products in your jurisdiction. >> Um, aside of course, maybe you're an accredited investor or you have a a different legal setup, but usually you get exposure or access to the products where you at. Um, therefore, if you're in the US, usually it's the ETFs. In in in Europe, it's the ETPs. Um, but yeah, that's that's basically it. But that's why we're trying to expand globally, of course, because we want to make sure we serve the world and in any jurisdiction you you have some sort of access to to crypto assets. >> Okay, cool. I see on the website you've got like I'm default to US, but you have Europe, United States, Switzerland, UK, UAE, rest of the world, and Brazil. >> Cool. So, you got products in all those places. That's nice. Exactly. Exactly. UK also just opened up for retail investors which we're quite excited about. Um obviously everything dwarfs uh compared to the to the US market but we think in the UK uh it could be the the biggest market in Europe. Um so quite excited about that. Do you think that the reason that retail buy your products is because they they know that they want exposure but like the whole idea of self custody is scary to them or something like I don't understand using uh any ET ETP or ETF there's like fees attached to that. So um and for someone like me and my friends who are very comfortable using crypto technology but would you say like that's the best the biggest reason that individual or retail would would buy those kind of products? I I would say it's one of the reasons absolutely um I mean once again we had 21 SH like including myself we're not opposed to self custody that's absolutely in the spirit and ethos of of of Bitcoin and crypto as a whole. So anyone who's able uh to to to to jump over that technical hurdle um should go for self-custody. But it's exactly that responsibility that might freak out a lot of people. Um, of course, the beauty is that with an ETP or an ETF, you basically buy it as just like any other stock like any other ETF. You have your existing brokish account. You type in an um, and you get exposure. You don't have to worry about private keys. You don't have to worry about a separate account. not even even taxes are easier because by the end of the year you just get a tax statement and it's very easy to handle. Um so that that's a lot of reasons why I think retail but also all the the other clients like family offices, private banking, they they prefer ETFs out of convenience. Um but and I also ask my friends I have a lot of friends it having a lot of Bitcoin and self custody custody them it's it's a lot of it's it's it's a lot of responsibility especially if you don't have the technical knowhow um I always tell my friends imagine you have 20 million um of which 10 are from your family would you self custody the entire thing. Um, some might, uh, me personally, I might even, but maybe I want to have a bit of that in ETFs just to to have ease of mind and someone to call if something something goes wrong. >> Adrian, uh, is there anything else that you want to talk about that uh, that we haven't yet? And also, how can folks find out more about 21 shares and, you know, talking to someone if they want to? I mean, just feel free uh of course check out our website um 21shares.com. Um also follow us on the socials um 21 shares or myself even Adrian WJ Fritz uh on Axe."
