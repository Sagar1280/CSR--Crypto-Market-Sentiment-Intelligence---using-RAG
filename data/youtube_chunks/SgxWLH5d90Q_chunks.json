      "text": "[music] We have a very quick update for you guys on today's video. I just want to very quickly go over where you need to invalidate if you have been holding the long trades that we've been focused on over the last couple of weeks. Uh we'll also have a very quick overview of what's happening in the medals market. Obviously, gold and silver continuing that journey towards the upside still going parabolic the way that you wish your altcoins were. Um, and then we'll just have a look at Bitcoin and what you need to focus on leading into the weekend. So, smash a like button. Let's get straight into the show content. A lot of the coins over here are starting to pull back. Uh, that is on the dailies. The real thing that you want to be looking out for is defending Tuesday's low, right? Tuesday was the candle that led to upside momentum for the majority of the market. And that's what you're going to want to defend uh irrespective of which coin you're looking at. For Bitcoin, it was a $4,000 move towards the upside. um you know leading into some of those breakouts uh which we of course got that long trade on the table so stops are moved to break even and that goes the same for Ethereum as well as some of the other coins. So we'll get into it. We'll have a look at the TA and the way everything lines up. Let's first quickly just go over what's happening in the medals market over here. So just zooming in on the lower time frame. I did cover this with the whale room yesterday, but uh sometimes you see these consolidations with high highs and high lows following a first big move towards the upside over there. Um so you get these really really bullish bull flags. As long as this maintains over here, I'll be looking for gold to accelerate probably through our target. So just to be clear, I don't have any hard set takeprofit at TP level one over there. I'm going to just be um you know letting that be a floating P&L so I can assess how much momentum you come through this level because this could take it straight up to 4,800. And of course if I can sell that um gold position a little bit higher than intended for the first take profit. I'll definitely be wanting to do that. So that is gold on the hourly. Everything looks good over here for continuation higher. Um just to highlight the take-profit levels. Take profit level one, take profit two, and take profit three on the yellow lines over there. Then we'll go to silver. Silver also very very very strong still. Easy and obvious invalidation is below yesterday's low for silver. If you're in a long trade on silver, you do not want to trade below that. Yesterday's candle started to look like an"

Silver also very very very strong still. Easy and obvious invalidation is below yesterday's low for silver. If you're in a long trade on silver, you do not want to trade below that. Yesterday's candle started to look like an engulfing candle and then it quickly rallied back towards the upside. So, a lot of strength over there and you should expect probable continuation um on silver and then platinum stop losses floated down over here at 2,182 also below yesterday's low. Um, what else do we have over here? Copper. I'm not really too focused on copper, but for anyone that is long on copper based on low time frames, I would have a stop loss floating at $557. So, we can go into the stock market. Let's see how the stock market's looking. Everything all good on the S&P 500 rolling onwards and upwards. Dow Jones also onwards and upwards. And then we have QQQ which is showing a little bit more weakness over here. We are seeing in some of the tech stocks a little bit of weakness, right? So, if you look at some of these things, especially within the Magnificent 7, some of them do look like they want to roll over. I guess this is also affecting um the QQQ over here, NASDAQ. So, I'm not re-entering into this trade. I did get stopped out on that. It is unfortunate especially since the stop is basically directly into support but at you do have to have some invalidation and it was too low to float the stop loss any lower than that. Um so consequently I'm out of this trade and will re-evaluate at a later stage. So you can see over here for example if you look at Robin Hood that's a big move towards the downside right Robin Hood has been trading very similar to Nvidia in the fact that you've got this horizontal area that you definitely want to be holding as support right so now hanging below that area and this could very very very quickly start to fall apart um we can have a look at some of the key support zones maybe if you're into into Robin Hood or you're looking for an entry I'll be focused on this 50% level over here to see and evaluate what sort of support you find at about 91. So 90 to 91 uh dollars over there for Robin Hood. Going on to Tesla. This is another one to have a look at. Uh because you're bobbing and weaving around here. I do want to show you as well on the"

So 90 to 91 uh dollars over there for Robin Hood. Going on to Tesla. This is another one to have a look at. Uh because you're bobbing and weaving around here. I do want to show you as well on the weekly time frame just very quickly. If we um expand this chart out a bit, you can see that these lows are going to be highly significant, but very similar to the trade that I took over there on NASDAQ, right on QQQ. the real stop would actually be below those weekly lows but then you're taking on too much risk. So I've tried to keep it relatively tight based on the dailies and the ultimate thing is if you are trading this as you know an investor you're a long-term trader this is really the lows that you don't want to trade below. So if this daily gets taken out based on the daily trade that we have and the setup that we have over here on Tesla and then you start to trade back below um let's say 382. So, anything that's trading below 382, especially with high time frame closes like uh dailies, especially a weekly, well, this is going to look like a big deviation, and then this is going to be going much lower, and you would have to stop out of that position. So, I only mentioned the downside over here because, of course, we've been bobbing and weaving and and uh threatening this level for quite some time. So, what we need to ask ourselves, you know, is this just another lower high and this is going to come down? If so, uh I would be stopping out of that trade over there and looking for a new entry uh because we don't want to go all the way below these lows otherwise we're taking on far too much risk. Right? So that's what's going on over here in uh call it stock market land in metal land over there. Remember I always advocate as well to um scale into your positions with let's use the word finesse, right? With finesse. So, if that is basically the way you're looking to take the trade, well, you'll be building smaller positions at the top, larger positions as you get lower and lower down towards where the main invalidation is. So, you can drastically reduce risk. Now, I have mentioned this a couple of times before. I'm going to mention it again just so that I made it easy for you guys today or at least hardest who's in the background there. Thank you so"

He went and he found the tutorial over here which I did actually on by. So, there's a Bybit tutorial over here. If you go and have a look at that link and you haven't signed up to buy it, by the way, you're getting up to a $30,000 signup bonus. They are one of the best exchanges to trade on. You can trade now as well. Things like gold. So, if you're cryptocentric person, that might be of value for you. And it shows you how to claim your bonus as well. But what I want to really reference towards is the tutorial because in that tutorial, I show you how you can use the bybit specific tools to create this kind of an order, right? a scaled order in a pyramid um like fashion or a triangular fashion, right? So smaller orders at the top, larger orders at the bottom as opposed to sitting there with a calculator and limit order after limit order after limit order. They create a beautiful visual for you. Uh they do have that ability where you can change these percentages over here and it does it for you as well um automatically. Right? So go and check out that tutorial if you haven't already checked out that tutorial before. um the section where I start to show that it's all timestamped actually. Just look at the time stamps. That's all that you have to do um for that video. All right, let's quickly go through crypto. I don't want to spend too much time on it because things are not too different to where we were at yesterday. Long to short ratio almost 50/50 only a skew of negative 1.62. So things are pretty balanced and neutral. We saw that the fee and greed came down a little bit. We were in cautious optimism at 61. Given the little bit of downside that we've had today, of course, we're now at 49%. We can see the funding is still neutral over there to slightly negative. We have liquidations cooling off again, not that high, right? 247 million. Most of those actually came from the long side. Late longs piling in over there. And then this is the key thing, right? If this signal confirms, get out, right? I guess a little bit of a little bit of sensationalism and clickbaitness over"

Late longs piling in over there. And then this is the key thing, right? If this signal confirms, get out, right? I guess a little bit of a little bit of sensationalism and clickbaitness over there as always. But on a more serious note, if the volume starts to turn over for now, it's holding up, right? It's holding up because there's been an increase in volatility. But if you start to see some lower highs forming over here and that volume on the daily exchange volume begins to roll over paired up with, of course, what I did mention over here on the dailies, if you start to take out this candle, and this goes across the board for pretty much any coin that you're looking at, this big candle that led to the upside move, you have an easy and obvious invalidation. You do not want to break back below that Tuesday candle. Taking out that candle, which for Bitcoin, the exact to the dollar, to the cent low is $90,925.17. Right? So, um here's a a quick tip for you guys as well. Look at the top over here. You see those numbers on the top of Trading View? If you hover your cursor over that, it will say um over there you got the open, the high, the low, the close. So, you don't have to do guesswork. The exact low is $90,925.17. If you take out that low, this thing's going to fall apart over here. And that would have been a massive bull trap. So again, if you see that, basically, that's your opportunity to get out. Uh we'll see what comes in with the ETF flows for the week. But the daily has started to dwindle off over there. You can see the daily over there, we had some big inflows back down to lower inflows over there. Often times this can be treated as a major counter signal when you get these big spikes. Look at that. That marked the exact exact exact all-time high where Bitcoin went to $126,000. We had the biggest ETF flow week by far by a country mile. So consider this right at the extremes. When there are extremes, look at those levels. Um, all righty. What else? A quick look over here. I keep forgetting what's on our economic calendar, so we may as well just check. Um, all right. Are we all cleared? So yes, we are all clear. The jobless claims are through. Nothing on the economic calendar. Um, you know, other than potentially uh US attacking Iran. So"

Are we all cleared? So yes, we are all clear. The jobless claims are through. Nothing on the economic calendar. Um, you know, other than potentially uh US attacking Iran. So I saw that that Trump came out and said he doesn't want to do that. Yet the market went down straight after he said that. So we'll see how that develops, right? These things usually take time to unfold. The deltas over here slightly positive on BTC, ETH, and Salana. Uh but everything's mostly neutral in terms of the long to short ratio across top 10 coins. So not too much to mention over there. I think that this is still one of the main charts. One of the things I'm focusing on the deepest I really see this going personally is between 5% and 5.35% and then I'm expecting that journey to continue higher which means any little drop off over here creates relief in the crypto markets which creates an opportunity for you to potentially exit. Now that uh of course is in the shorter term is the plan that we're looking at. I can always pose the question to you what do you think happens on the longer term the higher time frame 6 months from now. If you haven't noticed already there's always a poll and I try and you know gauge where you guys are at. And if we have a look over here your outlook for the next 6 months is that 43% of you believe both Bitcoin and stocks will be trading much higher than what we're at right now. 23% of you believe Bitcoin is going to be lower but stocks will be higher. and 30% of you believe BTC and stocks are going to be trading lower. Okay, this is a difficult one to click because generally speaking, stocks just go higher and higher and higher. So, timing a major top on the stock market is always a difficult thing. It's much easier to do with crypto because it's super cyclical and we have our finger on the pulse over there. Um, so we'll see. We'll see what happens over here, but that is where the sentiment resides. So, moving into Bitcoin, we haven't yet broken any of these key levels. In fact, we wick directly into it and reject it from that level. But I find this pretty interesting because we've spoken about this before. Uh the big question mark is, hey, are we in this environment over here? Well, one thing that we can consider and look at is"

In fact, we wick directly into it and reject it from that level. But I find this pretty interesting because we've spoken about this before. Uh the big question mark is, hey, are we in this environment over here? Well, one thing that we can consider and look at is from once that low was printed, how long did it take before we put in that major high? It was nine weeks. Nine weeks later, we put in that major high where we peaked our head over the top of that super guppy indicator which had a bearish cross on the weekly and then the 10th week we started to come down. By the 11th week you knew that you were in trouble. So what would that look like in relation to right now? So we had nine weeks and 11 weeks you knew you were in trouble. So nine weeks from bottom to top well we're on week eight. So, if next week we continue to pierce higher then and and we trading in the $100,000 territory, which is part of where the relief rally target was, and then we fast forward that to week 12, well, we're nowhere in trouble. Then, therefore, we should have our answer by Valentine's Day, will it be a sea of red, just like the color theme of Valentine's Day in that week? Well, the crypto gods probably have a sense of humor and I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case. So, just be aware of that, right? Just be aware of that. That's all that I'm saying. Uh, we have come above the high volume points of control, which is a good sign, but you need to now hold that level. If you immediately break below and and lose that level, then that is a warning sign. You can see the volume has now started to drop off again. And we do of course have our um, you know, bare moon that's coming up. Just focus on that on that white line over there. that is going to be coming up this Sunday. The bare moon will print. Uh for those of you that don't think that it works, go back. I think it's about a 70 to 80% hit rate over there. Bullmoon price goes up. So bare moon, will it lead into a pullback that just creates a higher low or will we be going much lower? Well, if it if we continue to rally up over the course of today and tomorrow and you print a local high within this region over here, I'll definitely be taking profits, right? This is the long trade setup. 100% take"

Well, if it if we continue to rally up over the course of today and tomorrow and you print a local high within this region over here, I'll definitely be taking profits, right? This is the long trade setup. 100% take profits. Then we can re-evaluate coming into the next week. That pullback over the bare moon period should then lead into a high low, which will give you a secondary but a safer opportunity to get into the market for longs for hopefully a break above the stop and reversal indicator and the 21 EMA because every week this is dropping off, right? Every week this is dropping off. So you can imagine by next week this is probably going to be under $100,000. So if you get that pullback, if you do get that pullback over here that leads into a higher low, then you might be positioned to break that 100k level and maybe shift things, right? I still lean towards the more bearish outlook for the medium and high time frame. Remember short-term, hence the long trades was bullish. That was bullish, but we need a lot more work to be done, right? There's a lot of work to be done from the bulls to reverse this. To tell you the truth, you'll only have true confidence that there's full on reversals and everything is healthy in about 3 months. Like it's going to take at least 3 months. So, it's going to be hard to put your hand on your heart and say bulls are in full control and everything looks hunky dory and wonderful. Um, until 3 months have passed. What I would need to see for that to happen is three months of probably ranging and reclaiming $100,000 to rebuild a strong base that could then create a launch pad to send things high. We're not in that environment right now. Right now, this is lower high territory and that's the expectation is a rally up possibly maybe one more spike up into this 103K 104k region and then a rejection from there. So, I'm being super super cautious over here. We have liquidity building. It's not over 100 million yet, but it's getting close. We had 80.56 million. So before we get into altcoins over here, uh do me a favor guys while you're voting over there as well. Please do go and smash the like button.

Smash the like button and we will get into the rest of the charts. So, let's quickly have a look at what's going on on Pinex over here because this is where a lot of the trades are. So, that Tesla trade still scaling in. I've given you the plan. I've shown you what to look at. Um, we got Pippen. We have the short trade over here. I'm slightly negative, but not because the position hasn't worked out. It's more because of the funding rate. So this is the only thing is the the cost of the funding because you can see the trade is actually in profit marginally in profit. But you ask well why in the red if it's in profit? Well it's because of the funding. Unfortunately if a lot of other people are are um short on this trade as well looking for the same idea of a big breakdown then we are paying to be short over here which means if anyone that's long over here they'll be making money even though price is going against them. So there's a fine balancing act over there on Pippen, right? That's the Pippen trade. ETH is all good. So ETH is still up. We can go through to the ETH trade over there. Um, still holding this position over here. Same story. You don't want to take out Tuesday's low. If you engulf Tuesday's low, big, big, big problems. That means you would have to do something like this. One of those waterfall effects, right? Where where you had the big move up and then it just becomes a waterfall towards the downside. Or maybe later on there could be a Bart Simpson. Hopefully not. Hopefully we don't see a botson. Hopefully this just consolidates bull flags and makes another run towards the upside. So no change for me personally on the ETH trade. Uh Apple short trade. I'm going to continue to hold. Let me just quickly touch on Apple because I did miss it today and I just want to show you what we're looking at. Okay, Apple already turning over. So I'm going to"

Let me just quickly touch on Apple because I did miss it today and I just want to show you what we're looking at. Okay, Apple already turning over. So I'm going to continue to hold that short trade on Apple. One of the ideas was that if this does put in a spike up higher, I'm looking for this to fail between the two yellow lines. So, for anyone that missed out on the previous trade uh in the in terms of the previous short trade, well, you'd be looking to scale in like that into your short position. Smaller smaller sell orders at about 266, larger sell orders are 272. Stops would be floating above that wick over there. And then you expect a lower high to form, which would look something like this. So, you'd look at something like this. and then continuation down on Apple. So again, we're seeing some of that weakness in a couple of these uh magnificent seven stocks over there and you want to be aware of that. Uh XMR, which is Monero, still holding that. We have been taking profits. Let's quickly check the price chart, see what's going on with that. Are we all good? So you can see profit taking right in the exact zone. Um you know, pullback zones. So, I'd be looking for major support to be found at about 258 or excuse me, $558 up to 650. That is the area of interest. Okay. Uh gold. We have gold over there. Uh also up $2,400. We've covered gold already. It's still bullish. All's good. And then lastly, Micro Strategy is the other position. So, let's quickly have a look at what's going on over there. Um what is happening on Micro Strategy? You know, that could be it. This would be a more extreme relief rally into this zone over here. But maybe that's it. Maybe Micro Strategy is just going to start to come back down again. So, short trade is still there. I'm still holding that trade over there um on on uh Micro Strategy. Okay, all of those are linked. If you ever want to copy any of these trade setups, remember it is linked over here. If you go to Pinex and you go to So, the Tesla bot is still available if you want to copy that because Tesla is still in the zone. You can see over there the Tesla bot 3x long.

If you want the same settings as me, that is still listed over there. You do first need an account with Pinex, though. Um, what else have we got? All righty, we can go into a couple of chart requests. I just think that, you know, guys, I go through all this list, so I can always go to your chart request, but I go through like this entire list a couple of times, you know, a week, like maybe every two days. So, usually I spot if there's something good. So, unless you guys know for sure that I've missed something, I definitely don't want to waste any of your time by now going through all these requests when we already know that most of this looks like garbage. Uh, let me just see if there is anything that I've missed. Uh, give me a second. Let's just have a quick look. Um, all righty. What else? Is there anything? I think maybe like, you know, we'll have a look at this at lighter because there's a lot of hype over here on lighter. The only thing I'd be putting on the watch list for light is this trend line. It's been an aggressive downtrend over here. If it breaks back above this trend line here, maybe you'll get a little bit of relief into underside resistance and that could open up a trade opportunity. That's one thing to consider. Uh Apex hit our our zone over here way down the yellow box. So, that's ranging. A I definitely wouldn't fade CZ. I think that it's one to keep on the watch list, but it could range for a long time before moving up um in in a much more systematic uptrend, right? So, not much to comment. Yes, we can look at Dash because I did see that, you know, Dash had a big move over here. Let's just look at the yearly outlook. This is probably going to open up a short trade opportunity. I don't know why Dash would be moving. Like, is there anything fundamentally over there? There's not even any messages um in this section over here to suggest why. But we can have a look at the chart. So, let's quickly go to Dash Dash USDT. Uh all righty. Let's let's check it out. What's going on on Dash over here? Okay. So, remember that other chart that I just showed you doesn't even have all the history. This was your 2021 highs"

What's going on on Dash over here? Okay. So, remember that other chart that I just showed you doesn't even have all the history. This was your 2021 highs and 2017 high should be even higher. It should be somewhere over here. So just putting in macro lower highs and lower lows. So if anything, this is probably going to become a shorting opportunity. You need to wait for it to turn. In my opinion, this is not a short that I would scale into while price is moving up. I'd rather wait for it to turn. So for example, over here, you got confirmation with a big wick. Price came down. You had a big candle towards the downside and then you could have scaled in around these wicks over here. So let's just expand this a bit to make it make sense. There we go. Uh I know this is a little bit of hindsight trading, but uh I'm just trying to give you guys a general idea, right? So you'd be looking to build a short like that, but again, it's difficult because it's similar to Pippen. You could get killed on fees. So for the most part, the best thing to do is to just stay away from these things. Don't buy them. Just leave it. Let it do its thing and that's it. There's no real longerterm opportunity because we can go over here, right? We can go to uh Dash. Let's have a look over here at Dash and let's go on to Coin Gecko for the full history. And there's the full history. So, that's what I'm talking about. It's just going to be macro lower highs throughout. This thing is going to get rinsed. It's going to trade back to zero. Okay. Okay. Another super important message. This is the most important message of today. It's very, very important because AI is getting more sophisticated, guys. And people are getting scammed like crazy. You are never talking to me on DMs. It's always a scammer. Whether that's Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, blah blah blah. It doesn't matter which platform. Go. If you want to be certain of my socials, they all link below over here. That is my ex account. If you click on that one, and this one over here is my Instagram account. If you click on that one, these are the only ones, right? So, it's verified. This one over here is also verified. So, if you want to go and and and follow me over there, follow me."

So, if you want to go and and and follow me over there, follow me. but you're never really speaking to me. It's always going to be a scammer. There's no secret trading groups or anything like that. So, I'll tell you a story only because now the guy got the money back. This is crazy. This is in the whale room Discord. Our security team were on it helped the guy along and got everything back. He actually made $100,000 profit out of the scam. It's unbelievable. So, they uh essentially got him to send capital. It was on a ghost chain though, which meant the hackers couldn't really do anything with it. They had to switch it, but he still had access to the account. He sent $500,000 and somehow they led the scammer on to believe that his business partner would get involved once they found out that it was a scam to try and delay it and made the scammer believe that there's much more money coming his way. So, he didn't he didn't try liquidate or move anything. So, they had to move things from the ghost chain onto another chain into a different token which then pumped 20%. and hence he made $100,000 profit and now finally has access to the funds again. But anyway, he's been in crypto for 4 months and that's how quickly things can go wrong. That was basically his life savings. He would have been absolutely rinsed. Now, if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true. No one is ever going to trade for you. It's always a scammer. Whether it's me or another, you know, person you're watching on YouTube or Twitter, it's always a scammer. Nobody should ever take your capital from you. It is a scammer. Stay safe. The only things I can recommend to assist to stay safe, and this might be uh, you know, a counter comment to what the masses would say, but I actually think that picking a couple of top tier one crypto exchanges and diversifying capital across there is almost safer to an extent than custoing your own funds. Because most of these hacks occur when people have things like a safe wallet or um you know they they're doing things themselves. They're custoding them their funds themselves. They now can change the middle section as well of um your your codes, right? So if you're transferring funds"

They now can change the middle section as well of um your your codes, right? So if you're transferring funds to a different wallet, they can they can somehow copy that if they have malware on your computer and they can change the middle. You we always look, right? We always look at the first three and the last three digits. You guys know what I'm talking about. They change the middle digits. So, be very, very, very careful. Like, there's no real foolproof plan. You want to be your own bank. Well, you got to be safe, right? So, one thing you can do, you can always get NVPN. It's also linked in the description below. They always have their uh their benefit for you guys as part of the community getting 74% off and four months free. So, this will at least highlight if there's malware on your computer. It's probably one of the most important things to do. Okay, some of you guys say use Linux. Yeah, you can. There's a lot of things you can do. Just be careful. Just don't send your money to anyone. That's the easiest thing. All right, so a little bit of a rant over there, but it's so important. So, so, so important. I cannot emphasize it enough. It's already hard to win at this game when it's player verse player and to outperform the market and now you have scammers after all of your capital. Okay, so tier one exchanges, diversify across them. Keep some money in the bank, not not too much as well. Those can also go down. Some money in brokerage accounts. You got to spread. You got to diversify uh and use security measures. All right, guys. That's it from me. I'll see all of you on the next one. I do hope you all have a lovely, lovely, lovely weekend. We'll see what happens with the Sunday bare moon if there is going to be a bit of a trap scenario. Uh be safe out there. I'll see you all tomorrow and cheers for now. Actually, not tomorrow, Monday. Cheers for now."
