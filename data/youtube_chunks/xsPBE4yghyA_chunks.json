      "text": "of the bank CEOs that I've met with here, most of them are actually very into crypto. They're starting to integrate it. You know, I met with one of the top 10 global banks in the world yesterday and the CEO told me, \"Crypto is is my number one priority. We view that this is existential. We're all in. We're going to >> Breaking news. If you hold Bitcoin in crypto, now is the time to get excited. The old Fed chair Jerome Powell is about to be replaced. and his likely replacement is Black Rockck's CIO Rick Ryder now surging ahead in the race for Fed chair. If you hold Bitcoin, if you're a cryptobull, this is the reason you should be excited. Rick Ryder is a huge cryptobull. Understand? Because of this man and Larry Frink, they both helped BlackRock become cryptobulls over the last year. The reason for the call today, John, is something just came across my desk, John. It is perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last 6 months. If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share the idea. >> Some of his direct quotes being pro Bitcoin, he says, quote, I think Bitcoin will take the place of gold to a large extent. It's far more functional. Bitcoin is here to stay. And going from Black Rockck's CIO, one of the most important positions in the world, now surging 40%, now 50% likely to be an even more important position, the Fed chair. I mean, think about this. A Black Rockck executive is now the leading contender for the next Fed chair. Larry Frink and the powers that be will have their man at the head of the most powerful institution in the world. Think about that. I want to remind you just how big of a cryptobull Rick Ryder is. Here he is saying Bitcoin is a hard asset. Bitcoin should be part of an ideal portfolio. Listen to this. And I think hard assets have to enter the equation today. Gold, Bitcoin. >> What type kind of percentage are you thinking about? Is it a 5%. What do you think the ideal portfolio is supposed to look like today? We're surrounded by investors. We're surrounded quite literally by financial adviserss who are thinking about that. >> Retail investors who who are watching. I mean, what does it look like today? >> Very different than the past. So maybe I'll start with uh I'll start with the equity market. I mean the first thing I would say we're going through the most extraordinary technology dynamic I've ever seen before. I would stay long equities. By the way, you can buy V you can buy volatility very cheaply to manage your exposure. I'd stay long equities oriented to where growth in technology is. In fixed income income is amazing. You're still clipping 6%. Would I stay five years in on the curve? I'd still clip that coupon. We're extending a little bit out. And then quite frankly, I mean, there's some interesting things to do in privates, bespoke markets. And I think hard assets have to enter the equation today. Gold, Bitcoin, things that give you a little bit of balance in the portfolio against potential for currency depreciation. >> When you talk about Bitcoin should be part of the portfolio, what kind of percentage are you thinking about? Is it a 5%, which generally seems to be what people are talking about, more or less? I just think it's going to go up and I think it's a good expression, but five seems high to me, but it depends where you are in your life and and how much risk you want to take. >> And then we can extrapolate what he thinks about Ethereum and crypto from what his boss and his company has said and done around cryptos like Ethereum. This is Black Rockck CEO Larry Frink from a previous quarter's earning call speaking about how bullish they are on Ethereum. the role of Ethereum as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So it's if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more more analytics related to these uh these assets then it will be expanded. But I truly don't believe it's a function of regulation of more regulation less regulation. I think it's a function of liquidity, transparency. Um, and then through that process, no different than when you, you know, years ago when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high yield market occurred, started off very slow, but it it built as we built better analytics and data, and then through better analytics and data, more acceptance and a broadening of the market."

And I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets. >> So, Bitcoin holders, you should be excited about this. You should be sharing this news with friends who want to know if crypto has a future or not. If there's anybody in your life who isn't quite sure whether Bitcoin and Ethereum and crypto have a future, send them this clip. I'll play you this right now. This is Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at Davos, the World Economic Forum. And he reveals on the All-In podcast, that the world's largest banks, he actually says, are going allin on crypto, on Bitcoin and Ethereum, saying the reality is crypto is massive. The largest financial institutions in the world are integrating this. This is getting huge traction on Twitter and X, and there's a reason why. Listen to what Brian Armstrong says in this clip. of the bank CEOs that I've met with here, most of them are actually very into crypto. They're they're starting to integrate it. You know, I met with one of the top 10 global banks in the world yesterday and the CEO told me, \"Crypto is is my number one priority. We view that this is existential. We're all in. We're going to put all >> Why is it existential for them? Why? Why? Because they're seeing it's like it's like when the internet came around um you know and you had Amazon competing with Barnes & Noble or you had blogs competing with not New York Times like in print, right? Yes. >> And so anytime there's always change happening in the world and you can think of it as an opportunity or you can think of it as a threat and bury your head in the sand and pretend it's not happening. But the reality is that uh crypto is massive like something like 500 million people have used it globally. You know, Bitcoin was the best performing asset class of the last decade. um the largest financial institutions of the world are now integrating this. And so at this point, I don't I think it's foolish to pretend that this isn't happening. And we also, by the way, have the Genius Act, the stable coin bill is now passed into law. So we're not going to undo that. That is that is law of the land. Like Congress just put that into law. >> And then I was really happy to hear this because there was that rumor going around, you know, does Donald Trump still support crypto? Does he still want to see the Clarity Act passed? you know, the strategic Bitcoin reserve, all this stuff. Was really happy to hear Brian Armstrong say this. This is bullish. >> And he understands also it's an important political issue. There's a huge base of there's like 52 million Americans who've used crypto now, >> right? >> And they want to see clear rules. They want to see this, you know, get better financial services in the United States. >> I was thinking on the way over here how you've really struggled to work with regulators over the last decade. I remember under the Biden administration, the 46th administration, you went to DC and were like, \"I'm here. I would love to talk to you.\" And they were like, \"Yeah, we don't want to talk to you.\" >> Now, some people might have varying uh feelings about Donald J. Trump, our 47th president. But one thing he has nailed is interfacing with the business community and taking regulation and creating a legal path for crypto specifically very seriously. What's the how's the last year? How have how have things changed for you in the last year? >> Yeah."

How have how have things changed for you in the last year? >> Yeah. Well, I know you like to call balls and strikes and I think just looking at it objectively, you know, the Biden administration really tried to unlawfully kill this industry in America from my point of view and Donald J. Trump, you got to give him credit. I mean, he campaigned on this idea of making the United States the crypto capital of the world. He's kept his promises. He's leaned in and tried to get clear rules and regulations passed so that uh American companies can thrive. American consumers can earn more money on their money. Um, and he understands also it's an important political issue. There's a huge base of there's like 52 million Americans who've used crypto now, right? >> And they want to see clear rules. They want to see this, you know, get better financial services in the United States. It's also, frankly, a global competitiveness issue, right? I mean, China just announced that they're going to pay interest on their central bank digital currency. Some of the largest stablecoin issuers are still offshore. He wants to repatriate that capital and bring it into the US. There are massive reasons to be bullish going into the next one, two, three, four, five years. For instance, Ethereum preps for the quantum era. The Ethereum Foundation has officially declared postquantum PQ security a top strategic priority. A new dedicated team has been formed to protect Ethereum against future quantum computer threats. Vitalic Buterine said, quote, \"There's about a 20% chance that quantum computers could break today's cryptography before 2030, and Ethereum is prepping for this.\" Things are so different today. The Bitcoin white paper is now displayed on the walls of the New York Stock Exchange. Wall Street in general, such huge bulls on not just Bitcoin, but Ethereum as well. Guys, it's possible Bitcoin goes one more leg down, you know, touches last cycle's all-time high of like 70 75K, but I'm more inclined to think that Bitcoin has bottomed. We're in a bottoming zone. Not that we're making all-time highs tomorrow, but I mean, I I tend to agree with how Kathy Wood simply explains the state of the market in this 20 second clip. Listen. >> Finished with the traditional 4-year downdraft. We're beginning to think we are. Uh although we could base here in the 80 to90 uh,000 range for a while, but we do believe the next inflection is up. >> If you want to make money in cryptocurrency, make sure you subscribe to Altcoin Daily.

I'm not going to play you all five minutes. Head on over to our Twitter if you're interested in seeing the full clip. But this is such a microcosm to conversations that are actually going on in the world today about Bitcoin and crypto and does it have value. So this was a heated debate about Bitcoin from controversial and popular streamers Sneo and Clavvicular. Head on over to our Twitter to see the whole thing, but I thought this clip was incredibly interesting and I will play you some of it. See you tomorrow, my friends. >> Crypto is a safety net. >> Bitcoin 100% is a safety net. >> Cope. >> Cope. >> Bitcoin. Are you kidding me? It's cope. >> Okay. I mean, just look at how much it is now compared to the three years ago. People have been saying that it's been that it's a scam for years. Look how much Bitcoin. It's almost 100K right now >> for like sort of a minimal return if anything, you know, >> minimal what since 2022 if you bought in. Look, look at the returns."

I don't >> Yeah, Bitcoin 100%. You should have some. that they it's expected to be at like 300K by 2030."
