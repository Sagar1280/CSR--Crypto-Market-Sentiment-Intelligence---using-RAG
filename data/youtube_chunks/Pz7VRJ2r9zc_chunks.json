      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coinb Trading. Today, we're going to talk about the rotation between gold and Bitcoin and why everything you're reading on social media is not entirely accurate. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different, and if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, I want to start off, guys, by pointing out, of course, these types of charts that I'm sure you've all seen all over social media, pointing out how there seems to be this rotation between Bitcoin and gold. And because gold experienced a massive rally that all of this capital is basically going to flow into Bitcoin, and we're going to see explosive growth in Bitcoin, uh this is not entirely accurate, but I will explain kind of like the reasoning behind it because at the surface level, the reasoning makes sense. Of course, many of you will know that Bitcoin is seen as kind of like digital gold. Uh but I guess the small problem there is that only a small percentage of investors believe that Bitcoin is digital gold. Most investors still see Bitcoin uh as like a higher risk basically bet on on the NASDAQ on tech stocks. The other thing to keep in mind as well guys is that when it comes to Bitcoin and gold, uh it's pretty interesting that even the people who believe that Bitcoin is digital gold, they kind of treat it as like a higher risk, higher reward version of gold. Uh and in that sense you could make the argument that even though Bitcoin is seen as digital gold, it's treated more like a digital silver because that's basically what silver is, right? Silver is like a higher risk, higher reward version of gold. Uh and this is where things get really interesting. So again, uh you could say on the classical risk spectrum of for assets, you would say that gold is kind of like a safe haven and that bonds are are also like a safe haven. And then on the riskier side, you would have Bitcoin and tech stocks as like the risky bets. This is just like again surface level analysis of like what we see uh in uh in the markets. And what's really interesting, guys, if you look historically, and this is something I believe I pointed out in a video last year as well. If you look historically, uh, periods when gold would actually start falling after it rallied, uh, of course that would correspond to a rally in crypto. We saw that in the previous cycle was actually pretty interesting. The moment that gold topped in the summer of 2020, and then it started falling during that whatever it was, 6 to 8month period. That's when crypto rallied a lot. And when gold was bottoming, that was roughly the same time that altcoins were kind of topping like in their first leg higher in the spring of 2021. What's interesting guys, we can even see this if we go to late 2024 when Trump got elected. We also saw that where gold had been rallying leading up to Trump's election and then in the two or three months roughly uh when gold price started falling that's when crypto prices started rising a lot. Uh so again that correlation does seem to exist but the thing is guys that this kind of you could say inverse correlation between gold and bitcoin. Uh and again it has less to do with the fact that people are rotating directly between gold and bitcoin or or gold and crypto. It has more to do with the fact that when people are rotating basically out of safe haven assets into risky assets. Uh basically gold and bitcoin are kind of or gold and crypto rather are like two sides of the of the same coin so to speak. It's like when uh investors are feeling confident they start to basically invest uh out of or divest from gold and bonds and they start investing more in crypto and tech stocks. And again that's kind of what we saw during the pandemic because of course after the pandemic started everything kind of dropped. Gold rallied a lot initially because of the uncertainty. Once people understood that, you know, things aren't weren't as bad as people initially thought."

And again that's kind of what we saw during the pandemic because of course after the pandemic started everything kind of dropped. Gold rallied a lot initially because of the uncertainty. Once people understood that, you know, things aren't weren't as bad as people initially thought. Gold started selling off and you started to see that capital rotate into stocks and into crypto. Similar thing with Trump's election leading up to the election, there was a lot of concerns that there would be some uh social unrest. Uh but of course once those concerns were gone and once it was clear that Trump was a clear winner, like a clear victory, uh then of course uh gold did pull back because of course it was kind of assumed that everything would be okay. uh and crypto of course rallied alongside of that. Not just because there was kind of a rotation out of safe havens into riskier assets, but also because of course Trump is a kind of a pro- crypto president. But again, this is how it works in under you could say normal circumstances. But what happens guys when gold you know because again gold is normally seen as a safe haven. But what happens when this safe haven status kind of or I guess rather because of the price action because of the price action going up gold starts to be treated more as like a speculative asset. This is where things get really interesting. Uh the reason why I have this circled here guys is you could argue that the rally that we've seen since the summer of last year of the summer of 2025 this rally that we've seen here in gold has been mostly due to speculation. So you could say that yes all this rally that we've seen here throughout 2023 2024 that was central banks accumulating and all this stuff that everyone knows right but then you know the reason why we've seen this massive rally here over the last let's say 6 months in gold six seven months that has not been because of central bank accumulation at least not primarily that has been mainly because of speculation and this kind of changes the dynamics a bit and you can actually see the proof of this in case you're doubting it guys you can see that searches for terms like gold and gold price they started skyrocketing over the summer as prices started rising and that suggests that there was a lot of speculation going into gold in the second half of last year and this is where I have to introduce kind of like a different uh risk spectrum. So again we have the risk spectrum for for assets but we also have a risk spectrum for precious metals when precious metals enter this kind of speculative phase which I would argue this is where we are again in the speculative phase for precious metals gold is seen as kind of like the safer bet and then you have riskier bets like gold miners and silver and Bitcoin you know with a question mark although I would argue that potentially as we'll see we could see some rotation into Bitcoin and crypto. So again, it's like it's this complicated thing where I guess just to just to clarify, when people are looking at this historical correlation between Bitcoin and uh and gold and saying there's going to be this rotation, they're basing this basically off of the assumption that we're in kind of like this classical uh historic environment where, you know, there's going to be this rotation uh out of gold into Bitcoin under this risk spectrum uh you know, this historical risk spectrum thing for assets more broadly. But the thing is that since the summer of last year, we are dealing with a little bit of a different kind of like risk spectrum uh kind of investing if that makes any sense. Like the the backdrop is a little bit different than what is kind of implied by these charts."

Like the the backdrop is a little bit different than what is kind of implied by these charts. And this is where things get really interesting because of course we have seen silver rally like crazy since the summer of last year which again is consistent with this idea that we've entered the speculative phase for precious metals. So again gold is rallying, we're seeing gold miners rally, we're seeing silver rally. Uh and that means that you know again this kind of rotation between safe haven and risky assets we're dealing with something a little bit different. We're dealing with basically potentially rotation well I mean we are seeing a rotation from gold into gold miners into silver and then of course that begs the question are we going to see that rotation into crypto? It's almost like a different kind of rotation if that makes any sense. Again, we have the rotation, the classical rotation from safe haven to risky assets, which is what you're seeing all over social media historically, but we're dealing with now is like a rotation, let's say, from risk capital that's in gold, uh that's moving down the risk curve into other uh similarly, I guess, riskier bets on gold, if that makes any sense. Again, it's like a different kind of rotation. I I apologize if I'm butchering the explanation, but it is a little bit tricky to kind of wrap your head around. I guess the key takeaway uh if you made it this far, the key takeaway from this video though, guys, is that this kind of rally that we're seeing here in commodities, not just in gold, in not just in precious metals, but also in copper, in coffee, and a whole bunch of different things. This rally in commodities is consistent with what we see throughout the liquidity cycle. According to Michael Howell, what a lot of people don't understand is that when liquidity is peaking, that's when commodities perform the best. Uh it's, you know, crypto and stocks tend to perform the best when liquidity is rising. When liquidity is peaking, that's when commodities perform the best. So again, this kind of speculative wave that we're seeing now since the summer of last year uh in precious metals, you could argue is a sign that liquidity is peaking. That doesn't mean that crypto can't rally, but it does mean that we're reaching the end of this kind of liquidity cycle. And that suggests that this, you know, enormous uh rotation out of precious metals uh into crypto that everyone is foreshadowing. That's not really entirely accurate based on this kind of um asset allocation cycle. From Michael How's perspective, it would be more so that basically we've been seeing capital rotate out of crypto, out of stocks into precious metals. And that's why precious metals have been rallying so much since last summer. And I'm sure many of you have seen that there's a lot of people who are in crypto who are, you know, invested in Bitcoin. You know, it hasn't been people rotating from gold into Bitcoin. It's been people rotating from Bitcoin into gold, right, over the last 6 months. And that's why we've seen, of course, like this uh Bitcoin gold ratio fall uh and we've seen these huge rally in like other precious metals as I was mentioning."

And that's why we've seen, of course, like this uh Bitcoin gold ratio fall uh and we've seen these huge rally in like other precious metals as I was mentioning. But there is kind of a silver lining there guys and that's that at the end of this kind of liquidity cycle even though commodities are the ones that are taking over we do tend to see rotation in other sectors like we see rotation out of large cap stocks and small cap stocks and this is something that we can see here on the weekly chart for the Russell 2000 which at the time of shooting is you know on the brink of a breakout for like the third time over the last you know third or fourth time over the last like six months but as you can see historically speaking when the Russell 2000 breaks out um then this kind of like shaded bar here this corresponded to the altcoin season in the previous cycle. Uh, and it wouldn't surprise me at all that we start to see altcoins start to perform very well here in the coming months where Bitcoin is kind of more muted and just, you know, kind of more choppy. Everyone is waiting for that rotation, you know, from gold into Bitcoin. But the reality is that the rotation in this case was basically from Bitcoin into gold, consistent with Michael How's uh asset allocation cycle here. And yes, it is possible, you know, that we could see some rotation back out of gold and silver into Bitcoin. But again, what we've seen over the last six months seems to kind of be the opposite. But again, the silver lining there is that we're also seeing rotation, you know, not just when it comes to precious metals and this type of stuff. We're also seeing rotation out of large caps into small caps. And this is something that should continue. And if you want evidence of that in crypto, look no further than the ETH BTC chart. This is a really great way to get a sense of what's coming next uh for like Bitcoin dominance and stuff like that because under the hood, Bitcoin dominance just consists of like uh you know, the strength of the largest altcoins like Ethereum versus Bitcoin. So just look at ETHBTC and this will tell you kind of what's coming next for Bitcoin dominance and for altcoins. As you can see here guys, ETHBTC seems to have bottomed over the last couple of months here and looks like it's going to continue heading higher. If it does, then that should result in more of a rotation actually into altcoins rather than like a rotation from gold. It's basically it's not going to be a rotation from gold into Bitcoin. It's going to be more like a rotation out of Bitcoin into other altcoins and you know whatever capital that was in Bitcoin. A lot of it has already gone into gold which is now finding its way down into precious metals because again we're dealing with this you know basically late stage liquidity cycle where all the money is going into commodities that money in commodities is going down kind of like that risk spectrum and then at the same time we have a rotation out of large cap stocks into small cap stocks and I do think based on ETHBTC chart uh that we're going to see a rotation within crypto out of like Bitcoin into uh other altcoins and eventually from those large cap altcoins into midcaps and so on that's what always happens at the end of kind of like this liquidity cycle. cycle. That's when speculation is the highest and that's when you tend to see the largest rallies. But of course, we'll have to take things uh I guess one day or one week at a time.
