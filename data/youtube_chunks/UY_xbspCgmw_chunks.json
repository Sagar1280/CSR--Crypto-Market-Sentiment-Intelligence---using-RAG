      "text": "Banter fam, happy Saturday to you all. Just \nwanted to drop a quick stream going on from   yesterday's show to update you guys on a couple \nof trades I'm taking into the markets. We did   have a little push in Bitcoin. Bitcoin tried to \nget back into the 90,000s yesterday. And I want   to show you this over here, but still, we are \nstruggling to close above this trend line. So,   still giving me an indication that we should still \nvery much be looking at this possible $84,000 to   $80,000 zone. But again, I just want to make \nsure that we are prepared for both scenarios. I want to speak about my Bitcoin trades that I'm \ncurrently placed in right now. I want to speak   about a couple of altcoin trades as well as the \nBitcoin dominance. Usually into the weekly close,   which will be tomorrow, we start to get quite \na bit of volatility. And now that we are seeing   the slowdown, slowdown is when you want to really \nprepare for trades. By the time the move starts   to happen, you want to be inside of the trade. So, I'm bringing you these setups today so we   can be prepared for the next move. As you can \nsee that price is starting to really slow down,   which means there is a sharp fast move coming \nin either direction. Right now, indicating down,   but let's speak about it. So, guys, happy \nSaturday to you all. No wasting time. Let's go. Hit the subscribe button and hit the like button, \nfam. Okay, so let's get straight into the charts. Okay, so guys, yesterday I was in a short, started \nto play out from the show. I then dropped my stop   loss and then we had this little spike in Bitcoin \nthat basically stopped me out at entry. But I   do want to let you guys know that I have now \nre-entered the short for now because yesterday   was a chance for the markets to show that maybe \nthis little trap and losing this trend was a bit   of a trap, right? It was confusing and going to \ncatch the whole market off guard and there was   an attempt, right? And it was so important. You \nknow, this is why sometimes it's so important to   let something play out first and then wait for \nconfirmation, right? And we've been speaking   about this whole week where we've lost this \ntrend. Now, what we really need to see is get   outside the trend, come back and that will turn \nbullish. So, we had the opportunity yesterday. We   still closed below and we still got the sellout. So, for me, this is still very much fake at this   point. And I'm still very much looking at building \nshorts right now, specifically on Bitcoin. So,   the same trends I want us to pay attention to is \nthis top trend over here on the 4-hour. Okay? And   the bottom trend will be this wick over here. And \nyou could see that we are about 12 hours out from   the market starting to accelerate. Now again, \nhigh time frames things are indicating that   Bitcoin should be pushing down. We should be \nlooking at these levels of lower down to the   84 and even possibly down to the 81 and 82. For me, I think the 84 will be a strong level   of support. We should get a nice strong bounce. Reasoning is if we look at the total 0.618, right,   we're looking for this 0.786 right is over here at \n84. So if we lose the 0.618 which we did bounce at   recently at 87,000, the next major supports are at \n84. But like I said, we will track this down as it   goes on the weekly. We know that this will be a \nvery important bounce for altcoins and Bitcoin,   right? If we look at this major trend, let's \nget up this chart over here. This for me is   still a play, right? It is a play of from here \ngetting ready to the areas of into the 100,000   and then we can possibly turn quite bearish to \na big move to the downside. So, a higher low   here will be nice and bullish and that's why \nI am expecting a possible $84,000 to $85,000   bounce. When it comes to the trades for me, I have \nshorted in the same area. My entry is back in the   zones of around this 89,550 is around the level of \nme shorting. And I still see this whole zone here   being a shorting level. Okay. And the key level \nof a stop loss will be these zones over here,   which is around the 90,500."

My entry is back in the zones of around this 89,550 is around the level of me shorting. And I still see this whole zone here being a shorting level. Okay. And the key level of a stop loss will be these zones over here, which is around the 90,500. So, in the beginning, \nit's a little bit less leverage that I'm using   because I am running around a percentage of 1% of \nrisk, which means anything you apply leverage to   this, you got to times by that. So for me, it's a \nlittle bit slow of around a 10-15x at this point. Stop loss around the 90,500. If you want to be a \nlittle bit more aggressive, the 90,200. But the   reason why I've left it here is for me that's \ninvalidation. Price gets back up over there,   we could be turning bullish, right? But what I'm \nwaiting for is the drop of this trend over here,   this bottom trend. This is where things will \nreally start accelerating. So I've started   re-entering the shorts, leaving the stop \nover here. But when we break this trend,   right, specifically on the 4-hour chart and \nwe close below, I will be adding aggressively   to the position and moving the stop loss down to \n89,800. As we start to push down, I will be moving   the stops down. Right? So again, for me, shorts \nright now are looking a little bit more juicy than   the longs. If I look at the altcoins, I'm not too \ncrazy on shorting a bunch of alts right now. The   reason is Bitcoin dominance is actually looking \nin favor of the altcoins on the midterm right now. Okay, so again, what am I looking for? The easiest \nway to make money. And again, I'm locking into a   little bit of a Bitcoin strategy for a while, \nbut this is clearly showing that even though we   are seeing a bit of a bearish Bitcoin, which means \nBitcoin might be having a catch-up dump, altcoins   are still a little bit stronger, which means when \nit comes to trading alts, let's say you short,   you can get these crazy wicks that will be a bit \nbigger and you'll end up taking more losses on   stop losses if you are incorrect. So, what you can \ndo with alts is the same thing is you could see   that this now is the ETH chart. We had the dump. We are now making a flag. There's the top. There's   the bottom. Okay. And you can see we are quite far \nfrom both. So if I wanted to possibly short, let's   say ETH, it would have to be up here with a stop \nloss over there. And if I'd rather wait it out,   this would be the short target over here once \nit's crashed, once it's retest over here. But   for me right now, alts, they can play around. But \nBitcoin definitely is starting to look a little   bit weaker when it comes to the rest of the alts. As you could see, not really massive short signals   at this point. Okay? And again, it's not to say \nif we're bearish on Bitcoin, we're very likely   bearish on alts, but because dominance is down, \nalts could be wicky, right? And you don't want   to just get wicked out the whole time. So, same \nthing for alts. It does look like midtime frame,   we are seeing more strength within alts, but until \none of these lines break, right, I'm not really   interested in trading many of them at all. Same \nas Solana, right? We had Solana's wick yesterday. There's the wick. We're quite far from support, \nquite far from resistance. So, kind of sitting in   the middle in these areas. So, for me, Bitcoin is \nstill very much the trade to be taken. Then again,   the plan that I'm looking for here is I'm looking \nfor a short into a long. And that's the big trade   that I want to pay attention to, which means I \nneed to track this entire wave down. And that   will be the key area of what I'm paying attention \nfor the longs."

After that, I do think we are going   to hit back into the 100,000s. What I also want to \npay attention to a lot next week is taking one or   two trades stock market wise. So, remember Bybit, \nwe do have a Gold Rush trading challenge at this   point. So, I'm going to be trading a little bit \nof gold and see the difference, right, between   some crypto coins and well, altcoins and gold. So \nthere is a sign-up bonus for you guys if you want,   link below in the description. I am going to be \nlaunching a bunch of spot bots next week. So on   Pionex, I'm going to be launching a bunch of bots \nwith no leverage, right? And I want to show you   guys the strategy of let's just build some bots \nfor three or four years, no liquidation rates,   let them accumulate and let them build on the \naltcoins for us. Links below in the description. And the other one as well that I want to show \nyou guys is Gravity. Remember, every trade you   do on Gravity right now, you do get points for \nan airdrop that is incoming. So, I'm going to be   trading a lot on Gravity as we are getting closer \nto the point of the airdrops. Okay guys, so that   is basically the setup. So, make sure you got this \nflag in play. I have started shorting in this area   with the stop higher above these zones over here \naround the $90,500 zone. But the key thing that   I'm looking for is the break. So, if you want to \nbe nice and conservative, wait for the break. Stop   loss will then be nice and tight. Remember to take \nyour percentage where your stop loss will be and   that will calculate a good understanding of how \nmuch leverage to take on the position. Right? If   it's 0.3% you could easily 10-20x that and have a \n6% risk on the trade. Right? So you can do those   calculations for yourself. For me, I like to do \naround 6%—5, 6, 7% on risk if I'm very certain   on the trade. Sometimes I do a 10% risk. But \nultimately in this market, right, I would rather   start positions and build a little bit later on \nso that I can have that space and not risk too   much money. Number one goal for this year, use \nthese phases to practice less risk, but still   being able to make money. But less risk, less \nrisk, less risk. Lose less, lose less, lose less. Right? That's ultimately the main goal, guys. Lots of love to you all. Have a great weekend. I'll be back on Monday and then we'll have a very \ngood next week of trading. Lots of love. Bye-bye."
