      "text": "Hey guys, it's Jordan here from Coinb Trading. Just a quick update on the Bitcoin price action charts. If you're new to the channel, subscribe and let's get into it. Make sure you are taking advantage of our week's deposit bonus campaign using this QR code. For those of you who have been following my videos will remember that in this video one week ago. I did give the upper level of the PC of the larger range that we have just hit to the dollar that we are actually bouncing from our value area low up towards the point of control of this larger range. This is a reminder for us just how important these points of controls are and especially how important it is to always be aware of the larger range and where these high volume nodes are sitting. For those of you who missed it, all we did was take the fixed range volume profile using all of the information of the current larger range, drop it in, and as you can see, the point of control was tapped absolutely to the dollar. And this is not magic. This is not voodoo. This is simply price action and volume analysis on the charts. If you do need a full tutorial on the fixed range volume profile, there is one of these on my personal trading channel. So, check it out. It is absolutely essential knowledge. Also very important to note here was this other high volume node on the larger range PC which as we can see was exactly the level that Bitcoin needed to break to have its nice pump up to that larger range PC. We did get the pump because of the lower inflation numbers that came out and very nice to see the fundamental news analysis playing into our technical analysis and giving us such nice trades. For those of you who managed to catch my interview on the Moon Show last week will remember when I was talking about this golden pocket entry zone that I was eyeing. And as we can see, this trade actually tapped the entry perfectly right in the middle of the golden pocket. And we managed to get a very nice 8% up on spot from that level. That was very simply just identifying a completed trend and then taking our fib retracement from the top of the trend to the bottom. Now that we are back in value area high of our current micro range, many are looking to the ascending triangle pattern that is very visible with our lower upward sloping support trend line and our flat horizontal trend line. As we can see, this does look like a breakout. And now we need to watch to see if this level does get retested as a support and resistance flip. Dropping our fixed range volume profile back in on this micro range. We can see a very important high volume node here at 92K to be very aware of as well as our POC now sitting at 91K and this very high volume node level sitting at 90K. For me, this entire zone should be the very important zone that we are keeping our eyes on now to see if we really can flip that liquidity into support. We can see very very strong resistance here. Now broken, but no real retest after the break. This could be a nice zone to look for longs if we are going to continue our new upwards sloping market structure to the upside. A really nice indicator to use now to give us info on what's happening is the market cipher B. Please do check out the market cipher trigger wave and divergence tutorials that I have dropped on this channel so that you can understand and trade with us. We can see that these signals have been playing out really nicely. Our previous red dot trigger wave with a nice move down and even our last green dot signaling the incoming pump. Now we are watching the wave trend to see if it turns around to give us another red trigger wave to the downside. Our VWAP does look like it's turning around, but remember we need it to cross for the reversal. And money flow does look like it's pointing in the right direction currently for a short trade. This is what we really need to keep our eyes on."

Our VWAP does look like it's turning around, but remember we need it to cross for the reversal. And money flow does look like it's pointing in the right direction currently for a short trade. This is what we really need to keep our eyes on. And something really to be aware of here is the fact that if we do print a red dot and our momentum creates this kind of a wave, we will print the bearish divergence on this wave trend because we are at a higher high on price and that would be a lower high on momentum and this could be the sign of a very strong short trade. Please watch the market cipher divergence tutorial to make sure you are getting all the confluence for this trade. Something else still to be aware of here is that technically our bare flag formation has not yet been invalidated on this daily time frame. And remember that that price target is sitting all the way down around $74,000. It's a good time to stay logical and realize that even though things are looking bullish now, that could still be a possibility. Checking back in on our moving averages of the 50 over the 200 on the daily, we can see the faster moving average, the 50 is turning around in its direction and now pointing upwards. And this does look possible for a longerterm reversal. We have seen a break of price through the moving average and a retest of that moving average. And this could be one of the signs that we are now starting our upward sloping market structure for price to come up and test our slower 200-day moving average. If this happens, we could eventually get the golden cross of the 50 breaking up above the 200. But remember that is a lagging bullish indicator. And really this change in the angle of the direction of the faster moving average is a nicer early sign of this trend reversal. So, let's watch this moving average and see if the trend does continue above it or if we break back down below it to once again change the direction of that moving average. Very important for everybody to take note of is our new campaign with Weeks. And really, it is very easy. Weeks is making it super easy for us. For the first $50 futures trading bonus, all you have to do is deposit $100 and trade a $10,000 volume. A $10,000 volume might seem like a lot, but actually it's really easy to achieve by using leverage. You can then also see that you can earn another $80 trading bonus simply by depositing $500 and reaching a $20,000 volume. This also then goes up for those traders who have access to higher margin to deposit $1,000, reach $100,000 in volume, and receive a $100 trading bonus. If you are a futures trader hitting higher volumes, you can see here that if you hit a $10 million volume, you can claim a $1,000 USDT bonus right up to a $12,000 in total if you manage to climb the ranks of all of these volume levels."
