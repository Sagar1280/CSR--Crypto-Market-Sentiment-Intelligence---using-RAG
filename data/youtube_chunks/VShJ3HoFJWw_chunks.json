      "text": "Bitcoin please [music] go to moon stop going sideways now don't I say we going down to 1k but mr nocrat say we have a metal autocrat >> [music] >> 13 time 40,000. >> Let us go to moon. >> Yo, welcome everyone to today's cryptocurrency price prediction and technical analysis live stream. Bitcoin right now for the past few hours has simply been moving very very in a straight line. We are right now still at approximately $95,300. We are right now still trading in the horizontal range on the 1 hour time frame after getting a push towards the upside literally directly towards our major price target of this giant golden Fibonacci ratio. But on today's cryptocurrency live stream, I do have a lot of things to talk about with you. We are going to talk about the orderflow. Now, of course, if you are in our free VIP discord group, you probably know something I posted about earlier today in the morning and right now it is actually playing out some kind of very very nicely. Bitcoin is getting a very small push toward the upside. Also today we need to talk about the ethler stochastic CG oscillator on the daily and on the weekly time frame. We are going to talk about two very important trend line areas of resistances. I'm going to show you the bearish elit count on the daily time frame with the exact targets. We are going to talk about more of a local bearish elite wave count on the 1 hour time frame, but also we need to talk about the next potential trading setup. I really do believe that maybe even in the upcoming days we could be offered another short or a sell trading setup right here especially if Bitcoin is right I'm going to get another very small push towards the upside that is of course why I really do hope you are going to enjoy today's cryptocurrency live stream and also before we start sure of course uh press up the like as tadas jokeas 9 2956 is right was saying and also of course I want to welcome everyone on the stream. Uh Apple Bay welcome to the stream. Hassan Desx welcome to the stream. Ballinger bands tight AF. Um that usually means that a big move is going to happen very very soon. Uh Ali Primo welcome to the stream. Karen uh grow your back. Uh Primusy u okay welcome everyone that is right of joining. I'm not even going to try and pronounce uh everyone's names because it does look like the names are quite a challenge for me at least. Uh but yeah, let's go right now straight into the I'm here to to from S and Germany, bro. Uh cheers to Germany right now. Hyper, please make me a baby. Um okay, very interesting comments. Let's go right straight into the charts. Let's talk about Bitcoin price prediction, Bitcoin technical analysis. what can potentially happen in the upcoming days um from this specific horizontal range. Now, you probably remember from my last video right here, I was talking about the range, but not only about the range. We were talking about two very important trend line areas of resistances. Now, when we go on the 30-inut time frame, we go with a trend line. We connect our lower highs right here. Clearly this looked like Bitcoin was trading below some kind of an important trend line area of resistance. The thing is I was also going on the line chart showing you another one going right now only with candle closes. This one right here was beautifully respected because what you can right now see we hit the we hit or actually we are right now creating this specific trend line connecting the high right here and also the lower high. In this area, the trend line was also beautifully respected. But right now, Bitcoin broke it towards the upside. However, the breakout, you be the judge. But at least looking at the volume, nothing really spectacular. We broke the level because of course we need to be moving towards the right. We are moving of course forward. That is why we are breaking the level. Nothing major, just a small push toward the upside. Another push down."

That is why we are breaking the level. Nothing major, just a small push toward the upside. Another push down. So right now Bitcoin if we say this right here is a successful breakout um I mean definitely I wouldn't be going with a long trade right here but yeah the trend in here is getting a break towards the upside nothing major if you look like that because volume is pretty much almost non-existent now also if you are in the free VIP Discord server today in the morning I posted something like this major short trades have been opening for the past hours forming a big bullish CVD divergence. So what you're going to see right here quite a significant push towards the downside on our CVD indicator. So what does that mean exactly? It is simply going to mean a lot of selling pressure is coming in the market. Not able to push the price lower. Why not able to push the price lower? Because we are forming right here another higher low. But also most importantly this uh this area this price action right here look right now Bitcoin price look at the CVD indicator and look at the open interest major pump towards the upside major dump towards the upside while Bitcoin at least at this specific area let's just say from here to approximately right here it has not really been doing that much what does it mean you can see insane open interest increase people are opening brand new positions. CVD indicator getting a push towards upside which means people are shorting Bitcoin exactly at this specific area. Are we moving really down exactly in this specific area? Not really. We got a very small push down and then another push towards the opposite. So for the past few hours quite a significant bullish CVD divergence has been taking place on BDC. That is right now why we are getting this very small rotation back towards the opposite. For the past few hours, sure it has been very interesting in terms of the orderflow right here. But to be honest, in terms of trades, I haven't taken a single trade today. I do remain in my long trade for bit on Bitcoin uh from much lower. And also I am right now still in my short trade on Bitcoin, on Ethereum, on XRP and also Solan. I'm holding four short positions uh right now to potentially see if we are going to be able to get uh a bigger push down. But in terms of the orderflow, a lot of people were bearish. They were trying to push the price lower but they unfortunately were not successful. Bitcoin simply right now got another very small push towards the upside right here. Now something that is also very interesting and something that I'm right now definitely looking at is the Ather stoastic suator. Now if I'm correct I'm not 100% sure of course if you want you can correct me in the chat but if I am correct I am the only one uh that is actually looking at least on YouTube or also on Twitter. I haven't seen anyone talking about the Ethler stochastic CG oscillator. Uh this indicator in my opinion it's actually a very nice one especially when you look at it on the weekly daily and especially if we are then suddenly forming some kind of a double bottom or maybe even a double top pattern. Right now on the weekly we are literally exactly in the overbought area. Tomorrow we are going to uh pretty much get a brand new weekly candle right and we are going to get it in the in the next let's just say 4 hours. So probably this specific indicator is going to do something like this. Now last time we topped uh we topped on the ATL. What happens then? We got a push down also. Right here we topped."

So probably this specific indicator is going to do something like this. Now last time we topped uh we topped on the ATL. What happens then? We got a push down also. Right here we topped. We got another small push down but then suddenly we got I mean yeah we got under push up push down. Um but the most important thing is we were we are going to go in the overbought area while Bitcoin is pushing towards the upside. Similarly as right here similarly as right here. And also if you look like that, we hit the overbought. We got some kind of a push down. I'm trying to um approach the chart again as objectively as possible being in the overbought area. Again, you be the judge, but it really does look like it is going to be some kind of a bearish Bitcoin indication. That is why potentially we might be looking for a bigger rotation back towards downside. Not only on the weekly, we are in the overbought. Let's go on the daily time frame because the story is going to be exactly the same. Overbought right here. We got a push down. Overbought right here. Small push down. Nothing major. Overbought right here. Push down. You get the point, right? So, we are in the overbought area. Probably tomorrow we are going to be I don't know maybe going slightly lower right here. Definitely we are going to see uh but in the overbought area we should be slightly more careful because simply u historically speaking looking at our historical examples usually we do get a push towards thumb side after we are hitting the overbought on the ATO stocastic digital oscillator. So that is actually one of the reasons why I really want to be talking about the bearish alitive count uh with the exact targets uh and also uh what is going to be more of a local bearish ali count looking right now on the 30-minut time frame here. So let's go first of all on the daily. You probably already know exactly what I'm paying attention to right here. I am going to go on the buy chart because to be honest at least as of right now I do prefer the buy bit by buybit one over the coinbase chart. So we are going to go with this one where of course we have been identifying that Bitcoin got right here an impulse correction impulse right here another correction and right now we can be expecting potentially another push towards upside uh for us to finish the bigger fivewave price structure. So this wave count right now remains my main one and also uh it still remains in my opinion at least uh the highest probability one. So what are some rules that Bitcoin is right now still following with this count? The second Alien wave usually goes at least towards 0.5 Fibonacci retracement if not higher. Did we hit this rule? We go from the high back towards the low. And you can actually see actually let me turn this off. You can see we hit almost gold pocket. We actually hit the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. Took the liquidity above the high and then we got it pushed down. So this second aliot wave is I mean it is very nicely respecting the alien wave theory. Then another important thing is what is the target of the third alien wave and usually it is 1.618 Fibonacci extension. So we go with trendbased Fibonacci extension here we go from the high towards the low back towards the high and we go with only one 1.618 was the level hit and the uh and the answer right here is going to be no 1.618 618 using the the normal chart, not the logarithmic one, has not been hit on BTC yet. If we go with the lock chart, yes, the level was hit. And also, what you're going to see right here, the golden Fibonacci ratio was also hit."

If we go with the lock chart, yes, the level was hit. And also, what you're going to see right here, the golden Fibonacci ratio was also hit. And I'm not even joking right here, literally to the exact dollar accuracy. The exact high was, let's just see, um, 367. Uh, I mean, if you look like that, it was front run just slightly by, let's just say $100. But nevertheless, let's just say we hit the gold ratio quite nicely. Let's just say like that. Uh and then also we hit the 1.618 using the lock scale uh chart right here. Now if you're going to go with Coinbase, you could potentially uh you could potentially um right now say this right here was the first impulse or this one was was the first impulse. If we go with this one, what you're going to see no logarithmic scale from the high to the low back towards the high 1.618 was hit. So that is why right now if we go with the lock scale no lock scale doesn't really matter in my opinion the most important thing is we know the primary direction. So the primary direction I would still say is this specific bearish eleive count looking for another fifth alienate wave. So that is why in the upcoming days especially if you look at the stoastic oscillator on the daily on the weekly it really would make sense for us to get another push down again. Maybe some of you in the comments are going to say to me, \"Bro, you are going to be completely wrong.\" If Bitcoin writer does get a pump, definitely um if we get a push up, you're going to say, \"Bro, you were wrong.\" The thing is, I don't know what is going to happen. You don't know what is going to happen. I'm just trading right now the chart. I'm trading the highest probability. And looking right now uh on the weekly on the ethlers and also on the daily. Looking at the Ali trade scenario on the weekly uh and also on the daily on buy bit and on the coinbase chart I would say it is slightly more probable we go lower we take the liquidity below the recent low for for us to actually then finish our bigger fifth alien wave also. Right now what is the technical target of the fourth ali wave? We are going to go with Fibonacci retracement from the high towards the low. And the only thing we need to apply right here is going to be the fourth alien wave template. I have uh where you can notice that we definitely have already surpassed the 0.236 and also the 0.32. We came very close towards the 0.5. Now, have we actually touched it? Yes. On the logarithmic scale, Bitcoin touched the 0.5 Fibonacci. That potentially right now could mean the top is already in. Or if we are going to go just slightly higher, I would still allow for our 0.5 without the lock scale to be hit 98,400 and then we move lower. But the most important thing is this count in my opinion the highest probability one and also currently it does look uh quite nice. So because of that we just need to be paying attention towards upward 0.5 if Bitcoin right now is going to go just slightly higher towards the upside. Also, if you're going to go with um with a coinbased chart here, let me also remove this zone here. Uh we adjust our 4,000 wave here. Fibonacci from the high back towards the low. You can clearly see 0.5. No, it has not been hit. If you go with the log scale, exactly the same story. Uh the 0.5 was actually hit already a few days ago. So, looking right now this uh I would say like that if Bitcoin is going to get another push up. That being said, we continue higher, take the take this specific high."

Sure, we can still be looking to add something to our short trades approximately at the 0.5. Uh but only if we are then going to get uh a rejection back down. More about the trading exact trading idea slightly later. But the only thing I want to right now point out here is that 0.5 is one of the most important levels Bitcoin should not break up if this specific bearish bearish eleive count uh right now wants to be uh valid. The thing is breaking the 0.5 technically we are invalidating the the the fourth all wave because one of the rules bro I mean let me right now and show you this. We go with if you're in the free VIP discord server, go into the resources and here you're going to see alienate wave theory. Copy the link or click the link whatever and then we are going to go on this exact website. You're going to see something that um I'm I'm sure people on YouTube don't really show you do do they because I really want you to understand everything we are talking about here. Let's go with the um I think it yeah it is uh somewhere wait let me see where it is written uh because uh impulse with extension uh right here wave 4 is 14.6 usually I don't use this one because crypto is just too volatile and that is why this level gets broken almost immediately 2.368 uh 2.36 no 2 0.236 236 0.382 uh of wave 3 but no more than 50%. So 50% of wave uh of wave three is the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. So the rule one of the very important rules in the Live theory is that Bitcoin does not go above the 0.5. If this one right here want this bearish eleive count wants to stay valid. If we go higher than this level probably we are not talking about the five wave structure back down. probably then we talked about some kind of a three-wave and now we are forming another some kind of a part of a correction at this specific area. I don't even have the another scenario here outlined right now for BTC. I'm going to look at it after potentially the 0.5 does get broken up. But at least as of right now, the theory or actually the Bitcoin is following the theory wave 4 uh is um of course I mean those levels right here of wave three but no more than 50% of wave three. So at least as of right now everything is valid according to the according to the alien theory. Let's just see if this specific level is potentially going to get a break up uh or potentially if it's the right time still going to hold and we are going to move uh much lower back towards down on site. Also, let's go on the let's go on the actually I'm going to leave the I'm going to leave all of the numbers here. Let's zoom in on the 30-minut time frame. Now, with this first push down, um, some of you are potentially going to say this right here is not an impulse because what you can right here, see impulse, correction, impulse, correction, impulse. Clearly, actually, this is also I'm not sure where it's written, but there is um there is a rule. Let's see. Yeah, right here. Wave four does not overlap with the price territory of wave 1. What does it mean? We should not go the the wave four. For example, if we right now say this right here was an impulse right here, we got a correction. Another impulse right here. Another correction, another impulse. Wave four should not overlap with the ter territory of the wave fun. Did we go in the territory of wave 1?"

Another correction, another impulse. Wave four should not overlap with the ter territory of the wave fun. Did we go in the territory of wave 1? Unfortunately, we did. So, you can see here if we go with the low here, we clearly touched the the pre the low right here of the the first impulse, right? So technically speaking, looking right now purely at the purely at the theory, this count is not a valid one. However, I would say if Bitcoin is potentially going to get a rejection at one of our areas of resistances I'm going to share with you later, I would still say 1 2 3 4 5 it is um I would still allow it simply because crypto is usually slightly more volatile. And that is why saying that this right here is an impulse push up and then we get another push down. I would say it's a valid one. But of course, ideally, this does not happen. So, if we right now say that we are right now breaking this specific rule, technically speaking, we should be expecting for we should actually be expecting higher targets on Bitcoin. Maybe even in the upcoming days, but personally, at least right now, I would like to trade from level to level, especially knowing that we did hit the 0.5 using the logarithmic scale right here. So we I can right now actually show you a very simple um trading setup and also a very simple plan. Doesn't matter uh if we are in right now in the fourth Elliot wave, no fourth Elliot wave, uptrend, downtrend, doesn't really matter. The most important thing is in trading. You look for buys on the move down. You look for sells on the move up. Are we right on moving up or are we right moving down? You be the judge. In my opinion, we are moving up. So that is why ideally you are looking for a sell trade. You're looking for a short position. Um that is why of course as I said before to you and also in the video I'm holding a short on Bitcoin on Ethereum XRP and also on uh Solana. So what we can write to say here for for BTC if we are going to get a push towards the upside what is the first area of resistance what you can write to see we are going to identify so first of all let's just say that we are we are not going to go above this high in this scenario it's an impulse correction impulse correction impulse the targets are going to be we go with Fibonacci high towards the low we go with the fourth al second wave here so we are looking for at least 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level which surprisingly or maybe even not it is aligning kind of nicely not exactly but approximately here we have the liquidity level our recent highs and also the anchored VWAP so we go with the anchored VWAP from the high bam almost exactly at the 0.5 we also do have the liquidity and the anchor VWAP those targets this right here is the first important area of resistance and usually it is actually hit at least because this 0.5 is the minimum target of the of the of the second alien wave. So ideally we are looking for right now a push up. Again the orderflow would agree with us because we got a major push down here. Bullish divergence of course something I did say uh earlier today in my free VIP Discord group right here. We are right getting a push towards the upside ideally at least towards $96,000. Then of course if broken up we are going to look for the most important volume levels. Remember overall speaking we can still say Bitcoin is moving in a range. And here actually I'm going to remove uh this level and also this level from the chart."

And here actually I'm going to remove uh this level and also this level from the chart. I only am right now paying attention to those two Fibonacci levels 0.5 and the gold pocket. If we start breaking the gold pocket I would believe potentially we are then going to go even higher as we said before towards our upper 0.5 Fibonacci level towards $98,500. we trade from level to level right and also if the move right here is going to look look corrective tomorrow once the market is going to open stock market I mean once it's going to be Monday uh pay attention to the volume if volume is coming in we are moving more impulsively up definitely top of the range is then going to be our next major price target but the reality is at least as of right now it looks more of a choppy price action so the gold fibonach ratio and the 0.5 in my opinion are still very much valid targets So the value area high surprisingly or maybe not it is coming in exactly at our gold pocket. So the plan is very simple right now. If you if potentially you're not in any short trades what I would do in your uh in your situation I would look to fire a short trade the first one approximately at the 0.5. If we do get a push up push down right here close the candle below the liquidity level potentially you can be looking to enter uh with some capital uh at this specific area. If higher, if there is no reaction here, we look for the gold Fibonacci ratio next. Look for the reaction here. If there is some kind of a bearish candlestick pattern, especially if the move up looks corrective. That being said, low volume, choppy price action, not really moving towards the upside with major green candles. That is this is of course also going to be a red flag probably a BC correction. We are looking for lower here. In a case we break those levels like butter, high volume, look for higher. We are then looking for the top of our range approximately at least at least towards the top of the range if not even the 0.5 as we said before $98,500. Very simple game plan right here. Um you don't have to guess. You look at the level or actually you literally set an alert once the 0.5 is hit. Look at the reaction. No reaction. You look for the gold pocket. If maybe there is no reaction right here, you look for the top of the range. Very very simple. No guessing. you have the plan, you are not looking for random buy positions after, of course, we have already gotten quite a nice uh push towards the upside without any proper uh rejections right here. Uh and yeah, pretty much right now, let's just see how high Bitcoin is going to be able to go. Um and ideally, we are looking at least for the 0.5 here, 96,000 if not even higher towards our bigger area of resistance, value area high. Technically speaking, if the value area high right here does get a break up, bullish indication of Bitcoin simply because um acceptance above the volume level, it is definitely bullish thing, right? So if we get accepted above this um probably we are going to be looking straight towards uh the top of our horizontal range 98,000 um but yeah ideally also 98,500 US area. Now what is going to be a red flag? Something you should also be aware of once Bitcoin does start moving lower. Now I am in two long trades on Bitcoin and XRP. I am holding still a long trade but I took some profits of the table uh once Bitcoin hit the gold Fibonacci ratio right here."

Now what is going to be a red flag? Something you should also be aware of once Bitcoin does start moving lower. Now I am in two long trades on Bitcoin and XRP. I am holding still a long trade but I took some profits of the table uh once Bitcoin hit the gold Fibonacci ratio right here. So the bearish thing is going to be um start losing first of all the bottom of the range right here in my opinion major red flag. If we start going for example we go up right now we get a rejection. losing the bottom of range here in my opinion. Major red flag. The first major red flag, losing the bottom of the range. The second one is then going to be going below again the volume levels. Volume levels in my opinion are something you should really pay attention to. Uh because yeah, I mean acceptance above the value area high is the bullish thing. Acceptance below the level bearish thing. So losing this level right here, 93,000, it's probably going to mean 1 2 3. Fourth one was then formed. We are looking for the fifth one. If we get the acceptance below $93,100 US, let's just say um very simple plan. Pay attention right to the levels because right now this one is also going to be a very important one. If lost, major red flag uh in this scenario, we are going to look for much lower targets. Now, what is going to be the lower target? You're probably right now asking uh for the fourth Ali wave. So technically speaking, we can be looking for Fibonacci levels, but also I I really like to go usually liquidity levels are the best ones to target, right? So we have only two important liquidity levels right now on the daily time frame. The first one is going to be this specific low. This is the first liquidity level. And then we have the second one at 74,400. Those two levels are the two like oops uh are the two most important liquidity levels, right? The second thing you can be looking for are going to be Fibonacci levels. Now, if we topped out here, we go with Fibonacci. We go from the high to the low back towards the high. In my opinion, the most important one is one to one. And without the lock scale, it is coming in exactly at the liquidity level. With the lock scale, it is coming in exactly almost exactly at the liquidity level at the upper one. So, what we can say, it really depends how the structure right here is going to look like. But the thing is at least $80,500 is the price target. Then if lower we are going to be looking towards $74,400 right here. Uh but most importantly we take the low right here. 1 2 3 4 5 structure finish. Uh and then we are looking at least for a three-wave move back towards the upside. So once we are going to be at this area bro trust me once you're then going to look at the crypto fear and greed index probably this one is going to be in the extreme fear which yeah I mean people are going to be scared people probably are also going to get liquidated on the entire move up on the entire move down um and yeah I mean if something like this is going to happen definitely I am going to be prepared to be buying even more not only uh major long trades on Bitcoin but also I'm going to look to fire major long trades also on many different uh altcoins. The trading bots are going to be buying the DEP. Actually, more about the trading bots slight later because um I found out right here something very interesting that I also want to share with you. Uh but first of all, actually before we also write on talk about one very important thing here. I would appreciate if you go below the live stream and click the like button right here. Maybe 500 1,000 likes possible. I would really appreciate it."

Maybe 500 1,000 likes possible. I would really appreciate it. And of course also if you want you can subscribe uh to the channel. Let me look at the chat right now a little bit because I'm just curious what do you think maybe if you agree with me or no. Uh but then we need to go through some other very important things RSI indicator and also the semi future chart and also potentially I'm also going to go through the through market structure and exponential moving averages. But let me right now look at the chat a little bit to see what you are saying right here. Yes. Stock market. Oh, stock market is closed tomorrow. Probably they have some kind of a holiday or something. Um, uh, let's see. We are going to talk about the sim f future chart. What do you call a reaction? Exactly. Because you have a some kind of reaction on those fib levels. Um, usually I'm simply looking pretty much as I said some kind of a reaction. Um, you I mean if you pay attention to the liquidity level for example, let me show you this. I mean with the with the liquidity levels is the simplest, right? You get a push towards the upside. You have the liquidity level 0.5 above. Closing the candle below the liquidity level is a reaction bearish indication. You can be looking for a short trade here. If we then go higher, you have the gold Fibonacci ratio, right? The gold Fibonacci ratio. You don't have the liquidity level right here. So, I would be looking for a bearish candlestick pattern. Now, if you're in Discord, go in the resources where you can then see uh there are three good entry models. The best one entering when there is absorption happening at the key level. Then of course for this one you need to be looking for bullish or bearish CVD divergence. Depends of course if you are at support or resistance. This one of course is the best one. Then you have entering on a bullish bearish candle close. This of course looking only for the reaction or entering exactly at a key level by presetting a limit order. This one it's um slightly more risky but definitely very useful uh in the middle of the night one when you cannot be uh looking at the chart. So yeah the reaction is literally a reaction looking for a push up close below the close below the level. Um this this of course clearly is going to be a reaction uh and you can be looking already for some kind of short. Um okay okay I see uh stuck in 3,180 Ethereum short trade please guide. Unfortunately I cannot provide you with any uh guidance on your trade because unfortunately I don't have a license to be a financial adviser. Maybe in the future I could get a license for to be a financial adviser but at least right now I don't have it. Everything here what I say it's my pure own opinion. Um, so yeah, unfortunately I cannot provide you with any guidance there, but if you're in a short 3,000, yeah, it looks like you are right on being slightly underwater. I am going to do technical analysis on Ethereum slightly later. Uh, one thing I would say you probably did not did not use a stop-loss, which yeah, I mean, in my opinion, it's not the best thing. Would you agree that another new low around 75K would be bullish in the longer term and would make room for a new alltime high? Very very long term, yes. But um shortterm, like shortterm, I'm speaking for half a year, let's just say, I don't think so. Because low here, it's a fivewave down, right?"

But um shortterm, like shortterm, I'm speaking for half a year, let's just say, I don't think so. Because low here, it's a fivewave down, right? Five wave move down, which usually means it's the first part of a correction, which is then going to be maybe some kind of an Awave, Bwave. Sure, we can make another alltime high, but it's still going to be a corrective wave after which we are then expecting another fivewave move back towards downside. So, um, of course, could be bullish, but only for a short push towards the upside. Maybe also, of course, another alltime high. Uh, but then of course, ideally looking for uh for a bigger uh push towards the downside once again. Uh, let's see. Bro, why are you spamming? Let me just go here. Uh okay like this uh let's see please tell us the time frame to look for rejection. Uh usually I use 30 minute time frame uh or also 1 hour time frame. Those in my opinion are the best ones uh to use. Yeah the gap is still at 88,000 approximately. Exactly. Uh okay. Right now let's go directly towards our exponential moving averages and then also we are going to go with um with the market structure. looking right on EMAs on the 1 hourly we are still in a beautiful uptrend probably if we are going to go towards our liquidity level here we are going to be uh let me actually remove those actually I'm going to have this one still on um we have if we hit this level probably EMAs of course are still going to be crossing towards the upside they're still going to be bullish right so I mean right now EMAs 1 hour 2 hour 4 hour looking bullish beautifully uh so nothing to complain about here uh the problem is market structure on the 1 hourly we did break our bullish market structure towards downside we took the low here so we have high higher low higher higher low higher high lower low right now so market structure on the 1 hourly is bearish and also when you go with the line chart it is clearly a lower low so right now um yeah I mean if you look like that this right here could be the first bearish indication for BTC not saying we cannot continue higher it really depends how we are going to write the move higher Uh and yeah, if we are then going to get some kind of a rejection back down here, if it happens, I do think the top is probably in. We are looking for a bigger push down below $80,000 uh US area. Now, what about the CME futures chart? Because the CMI future chart right now uh you can see we closed at approximately $95,600. Right now, we are at $95,300. for us to technically I mean the the price is not exactly the same on the semi futures and also on the Bobby chart for example but let's just say we push towards the upside towards 90 um what we said 95 95,600 we literally need to go above the highs here we take the highs like right here we go towards the gap we fill the gap and then we potentially can move lower right so this is definitely something I'm going to be paying attention to also because like again the liquidity levels are something very important, right? So, you go like this. You have first high liquidity level, second high liquidity level. And also, I do believe, look at this. Let me see. Uh, let me zoom in on the 15 minute maybe. Did this high take? No, it did not. Okay. So, you also have liquidity above this high and also liquidity above this high. So, you have 1 2 3 4 liquidity levels at the exact same area. 95,000. Let's just say 800 is the upper one."

Let's just say 800 is the upper one. That is why I personally prefer the upper one here. also because of course we have the 0.5 here Fibonacci level uh and yeah this area liquidity level definitely an important one uh and I wouldn't ignore this one definitely not uh also because we know it is aligning with the anchored VWAP so potentially we go higher we fill the semi gap we hit our 0.5 that is slightly higher than the liquidity level and then we get a bigger drop which is then going to mean we have 1 2 3 4 5 we got a BC correction and we move lower so again losing the bottom of the range in my opinion it is going to be a major red flag for BTC. pay attention to this because if it does happen um yeah we can be looking for actually a much bigger push towards downside in the upcoming weeks let's just say so this is going to be in terms of the liquidity level and the anchor view but also we when we go with the RSI indicator look at this at least on the 1 hourly right now we are getting a very slight hidden bearish divergence I don't think it is anything significant you can see here higher high on the RSI let's go like this and then we have a slight lower high on uh on Bitcoin I don't think it's a major bearish indication to be honest. So this right here like yes it is there it is a bearish divergence but I don't think it's anything significant. Uh that is why I still do think this area at least is going to get hit. Not a financial advice not saying it is going I mean high probability it is going to get hit. Let's just say like that this level hits and then we monitor the reaction. Are we going to get a rejection or not? But clearly looking at the liquidity levels this right here is a beautiful liquidity level. Another liquidity level. I mean if you look like that also it is going to be above those highs. Um those highs right here we have one liquidity level if you look like that second liquidity level and also then the third liquidity level. So if you look like that you also have quite a significant liquidity level above the highs here in this scenario. Yeah we are then going to break the gold Fibonacci ratio. Uh we go above the gold pocket. I do think it could potentially be the 0.76. Uh let's go with this one. Yeah it is going to be 0.76. So yeah, like again if you're looking for a short here, the stop-loss placement is very simple. You go with a short, you can be looking again, as we said before, to enter something here. If there's a reaction, enter something here at the gold Fibonacci ratio and enter something potentially also here. Uh but again, depends how we are moving up. If it's impulsive, I wouldn't be looking for such aggressive shorts because in this scenario, we are going to go above the high. But the stop loss placement above the high here."

If it's impulsive, I wouldn't be looking for such aggressive shorts because in this scenario, we are going to go above the high. But the stop loss placement above the high here. your average price potentially can then be the gold bonut ratio and then the target is going to be let's go with pretty much the previous low it is 12 to1 risk-to-reward now one thing I want to point out here if we are going if you go with the short let's just say right we go higher you get stopped out you lose a trade okay what we said before if we are going to go higher above the high what is then the next level for us to go with or actually where we are looking for another trade it is going to be the top of the range the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level that is going to be at $98,500. You'll get stopped out. You're going to say to me, \"Bro, you were wrong. You lost a trade.\" But the thing is, personally, I much rather lose a trade that has a good risk-to-reward ratio than to go with only one trade. I don't lose it, but the risk-to-reward ratio is bad. So, what do what do I mean by that? For example, you go with this specific trade. You you target another lower low here, right? So the riskto-reward is 12 to1. Let's just say this trade is 12 to 12 to1. You get stopped out if we get a push towards the upside. Okay. You look for another trade if we get then uh of course another entry trigger. You go with a short trade. Let's just say let's just say you enter I don't know below the low below the high here. Let's just say at I don't know $97,400. Stop loss placement exactly above the high. Let's just say we hit the 0.5 almost exactly. It is going to be approximately here. In this scenario, what is going to be your risk-to-reward? So, in this scenario, you lost already this trade, but then you go with another one. So, the target is the same. You have 14 risk-to-reward. Remember, you lost this one, so it's going to be minus 1 R. 13 plus you're going to be plus 13 R. Uh, with those two trades, right? You're going to make I mean, if you look like that, wait, let me just write to be slightly more clear. You're minus one R. You lost the first one, but then you're plus 14r, which means you are net 13r in uh 13r in a plus, right? You definitely made money on the trade on the second one, not on the first one. The thing is, what if you go with one trade with a wider stop-loss? What you can then do? You go, let's just say you enter something at the liquidity level, then something at the gold pocket, then something at the 0.786, then you have a stop loss, which probably then is going to be above the 0.5. Maybe you're also going to have some breathing room uh which let's just say you are going to have the stop loss at uh at approximately 98,900. You then also add something to your trade if we are then going to get a rejection. So let's just say your average entry price is approximately here. Look at the risk-to-reward is 9:1. You go with one trade, you don't get stopped out and the rest of reward is 9R. You go with two trades with a tighter stop-loss. Net profit is 13R. What is the difference here? 9R and 13R. You're literally 4R difference with going two w with two trades versus only one trade. Some people do prefer wider stop- losses because if you get stopped out more times, of course, it can be maybe slightly more mentally challenging, let's say. But the thing is the math is there."

Some people do prefer wider stop- losses because if you get stopped out more times, of course, it can be maybe slightly more mentally challenging, let's say. But the thing is the math is there. Usually it is better to get stopped out more times and to go then with another trade because simply you usually make more money uh with a with a tighter stop-loss. Of course if you know exactly where you're entering if you know exactly where you're taking the profits. So this example in my opinion it is better. You look for a trade here. Sure maybe it's not going to play out. You have a stop loss above the high. You get stopped out. If it does play out, bro, if it does play out, your average price is I mean entry is let's just say gold pocket. It is 11.5. Let's just say 11th 11 risk-to-reward ratio. You're going to be plus 11. And you're not going to be losing the trade. If of course we dump from here, but you get stopped out, then you look for another one, you are going to be minus 1 R at the start. But the thing is another trade with a tighter stop-loss, usually it is then going to um outperform one trade, one single trade. You don't get stopped out. Um but then simply uh your risk-to-reward is going to be much worse. Hopefully I right now explained this um nicely. If I did of course you can tell me right now uh in the chat. Hopefully you do understand what I was talking about right here. But most important thing is in my opinion tighter stop- loss better risk-to-reward slightly lower win rate because of course you are going to be losing more more trades. Uh but yeah overall speaking at the end of the day usually you are going to be making more money um with a time stop loss. Just saying. Okay, let me just write to see. Um, smoking weed again. I mean, I don't smoke anything, so not sure where you got this from, Ricky boy. Um, what do you think about chopping price action 96 93 9874? You're right now saying we are going to be chopping around this area for some time. Sure it could happen but ideally I'm looking for a rejection already uh in the let's just say in this week ideally we get already a bigger move ideally towards downside. So um yeah we'll see uh it's called recession. Ever heard of it? Lol. You're saying about the you're right to saying about the like if we get lower I wouldn't really call this one a recession. It's just a corrective move on the daily. Uh so I mean unfortunately I cannot agree with you on this one. Uh I would just say corrective move looking for a buy below the recent lows. Are we in a recession or no? I don't know. I don't really if you look like that I don't care in terms of trading if we are in a recession or not. I just trade the chart. So right now because of that I just also want to talk about very slightly um about this those trading bots. As you probably know I have been using them right now for the past you can see almost two months. 58 days are right now running both of them on on Bitcoin and also on Ethereum we have made uh we have made exactly 16% on uh return in the past two months which if you look like that it is literally 8% return per month. Is it good or is it bad? In my opinion it's actually quite nice. Um, but something I noticed here. Look at this right now with those trading bots. It looks like it is better to fire them on more volatile assets which usually are of course altcoins. Why?"

It looks like it is better to fire them on more volatile assets which usually are of course altcoins. Why? So look right now at the grid profit or actually first of all let's right now look at the actual investment which of course it is exactly the same but the the leverage is different with Bitcoin because it's um with Bitcoin because simply it is um a bigger coin uh slightly less volatile uh I went with 3x leverage for Ethereum I went with 2x leverage so it means if you look like that 2x leverage time 15,000 is $30,000 as the actual investment. I do have extra margin here 10,000. Uh but the thing is only looking right now at the actual investment 15K * 2 is 30,000 three three times 15,000 is 45K right so clearly the position size on Bitcoin is higher but the thing is the profit is lower 3.8 3.9,000 versus 4.2 two. So clearly we do have a difference in profit and also the great profit because this one is more volatile is also bigger is higher than the one on Bitcoin. So now me logically thinking it might even be better for us to deploy even more bots on different altcoins. I'm not going to do them right now because the thing is if we do get a push down I do want to deploy them once we are going to be trading below our recent lows. And if Bitcoin does get a major push down, I am going to be deploying more bots and also of course more capital to the Bitcoin and Ethereum bot, but also I want to go with a bot on XRP, probably a bot on Solana, and also probably I'm going to go with another altcoin, maybe Cardano, maybe chain link, maybe also something else. I'm definitely going to try and um figure it out. But the thing is, it looks like those trading bots right here, the greed trading bots do work better uh on altcoins because they're simply slightly more volatile. And also again, I'm using a lower leverage versus BTC. Sure, I think it's quite smart for us to be using a lower leverage uh because um if we do get a bigger push down on Bitcoin, usually the altcoins are moving uh much more significantly, right? That is why uh for for the XRP one or Solana one, I'm definitely going to also be using I think 2x leverage, maybe even 1x leverage. I'm going to see how I'm going to go with that. Uh but the thing is right now it is still being in a very nice profit. The thing is if we do get a push down uh Ethereum and also the Bitcoin bot are actually going to be buying the DEP. If you want to be using them, you can definitely sign up on Pionex using this specific link down below in the description. you then deploy. I mean, if you're going to create an account, you register, you get 50 USD. You dep you then deposit, you got even bigger bonuses. For example, you deposit 5K, you get $800. You deposit 10K, you get $1,000. Um, but also, you can then deploy them the exact same ones as I have right here with this specific link in the description. Now, one very important thing I want to point out. If you deploy them right now where Bitcoin is at the moment and we do see a rejection back down, they are going to go in a very slight loss because they are going to be buying the dip. Uh, and of course, if we then simply continue lower below the recent low, you are probably going to be in a loss. But once we are going to get a bounce, you are going to have a beautiful position size. So, the bot is going to be buying the dip for you."

But once we are going to get a bounce, you are going to have a beautiful position size. So, the bot is going to be buying the dip for you. And once we get a bounce towards the upside, you are going to be in a profit. In my opinion, this right here is a form of some kind of a passive income. You buy the dip once we are going lower and then you are selling on the way towards the upside because the bots right here are going to be taking the profit for you. So sure, you can go in a loss. Even for example, if you're buying spot bitcoin, spot Ethereum, you can go in a loss if you're going to be buying right here. But the thing is lower we go the bot is going to be dollar cost averaging into the trades right here and once we get a push towards the upside it is going to be taking the profit for you. So right now with this current situation the bots I mean clearly they have been in a very nice ups slope let's just say uh because this choppy price action has really been the best uh price action for both of the bots. That is right now why I also want to go through Ethereum and also XRP very quickly because the reality is if Bitcoin does get a push down, Ethereum probably is going to follow. So what I'm right I'm right now expecting on Ethereum to happen here. The thing is if we are going to go lower as you um probably maybe also are expecting I'm looking for one of the best targets you can imagine because you have the gold pocket here. Actually I'm going to go without the lock scale. You have the gold pocket here. You have the anchor VWAP. You have the point of control of all of the upper price action. This right here, bro, remains the best long trade buying opportunity in my opinion on Ethereum if it's offered to us. I have also an alert right here where we can be looking for long trades where I'm going to be adding even more capital to my Ethereum bot. So, the plan is very simple. If Bitcoin does get a rejection, Ethereum get gets also probably a rejection back down. So right now let's just see what's going to happen right here. Ethereum to be honest in my opinion this looks slightly stronger than Bitcoin. That is why potentially for Ethereum we might be looking for this specific high. If we are going to go of course higher 3,447 then of course if we are going to get um a push up here rejection below the liquidity level we may might be looking for a short trade stop loss exactly above the high that is going to be formed targeting uh at least the low here. Maybe first take profit, second one the gold glibonut ratio. Bro, look at this risk-to-reward 16, 17, maybe even 20 to1 risk-to-reward. Depends of course where you are going to be taking the profit. But the reality right now is I do think looking for a short right here. In my opinion, it is better than firing a long trade. Not saying we are going to get a rejection. But if the rejection does happen, the risk-to-reward of the trade right here is just amazing. Also XRP the best trades long trades I'm saying for XRP in my opinion are approximately at the bottom of the range for uh XRP I would say you can use the lock scale or no the most important thing is I'm looking at least for the low right here or maybe even towards the bottom of the range here at approximately $1.6 $6."

So for XRP uh I would say if you're not already in a short like going I I do think right now going with a short on Bitcoin and Ethereum is slightly better than going with XRP short because with XRP short like I don't think we are going to move above this high. If we start moving above this high then you have the stop loss above this high you could potentially make it work but the thing is riskreward on on Bitcoin and Ethereum is better than on XRP. So that is why I do think going with a short trade on XRP and Bitcoin is better than going with a short trade on X on XRP right here. But also right now a good short trade potentially that can be offered to you is going to be in Solana. If you are in my free VIP Discord server 4 days ago I posted this one right here. Solana hit a nice liquid level forming a bearish divergence on the RSI indicator. So definitely also on Solana right here. I do think if we get a rejection like bro look at this you if we get another push up right we take the liquidity above the high your trade is probably going to be a short here a short from here stop loss above the high targeting in your lower low which in this scenario is going to give you approximately 8.5 uh risk to reward also a beautiful one if we go even lower of course even better but the thing is Solana in my opinion also looks like this entire move up is some kind of a correction so actually this entire structure It looks very corrective. That is why Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP. Ideally, I'm looking for a bigger rejection. If it does happen, our short trades are definitely going to be uh in a very nice profit. So, let's right now see what is going to happen at this specific area. If we do get a rejection, uh would be in my opinion a very nice thing. Uh if not, if we go higher, I do remain in my trading bots right here. Long long trading bots and also I do remain in my uh long trades on Bitcoin and XRP. But in this scenario, I am going to get stopped out uh on my short trades. Uh let's see. If you go to the weekly and count a fivewave move up, could this be an ABC now in CAC? If we sweep uh if we sweep but hold 80,000, could we get a new macro fivewave uh fivewave move up? Wait. Uh, if we go if you go to the weekly and count a fivewave move up, could this be an ABC now in C lac? If we sweep, wait, if we sweep but hold 80,000, could we get a new macro? I see what you mean right here. I think you mean uh you mean something like this on the weekly? Wait, on the weekly, a fivewave move up and then we sweep 80,000. So, you're right. saying sweep 80,000 and then I pump it towards the upside and count 1 2 3 4 5 um hm depend it really depends how you count this entire structure towards the upside um I am counting it as as for example this one right here being already um the the rising actually not this one uh I think we were going with this one right I think we were going with something like this 1 2 3 4 5 we have the rising wedge and now potentially If you're looking for a bigger uh ABC uh maybe also then another ABC and then bigger maybe even ABC down depends. I mean yeah I'm right now going very much in the future."

I mean yeah I'm right now going very much in the future. But the thing is my main scenario right now at least on the weekly here is this one. In my opinion is this one we got a potentially right now BEP the we can also form a new alltime high here. Then C something like this is the first part of a correction. Then of course we are going to go from there. Uh but the thing is at least right now uh I'm still being slightly more patient here. Uh potentially yeah the top can actually be in um let's just say at approximately 126,000. Um but yeah only time will tell of course. Uh let's see. Um if Bitcoin is bearish, why you don't close your long on Bitcoin and Ethereum? Because what if we are bullish of I mean the thing is when we got a push up, I took the profits on my long trade, right? It's pretty much risk management. It's very simple risk management. We got a push towards the upside at the G pocket. I fired a short. I took the profit on the long trade. I paid myself. I already made money. If we are right, I'm going to start losing the bottom of the range. I am probably also going to close uh my long trades. In this scenario, I only remain in the short. I made money on the long looking for lower. I have not closed my um my my long trades just yet because the market has not really confirmed that we are actually going to go lower if you understand what I mean here. Right? So, if we are going to then confirm we go lower, we lose the bottom of the range, we get acceptance below the volume levels as we were saying before. I'm going to close the long trades only remain in the shorts. Simple as that. Until then, I still want to be uh I still want to be in the in the short trade because what if I am wrong? It's all about risk management. Uh Omega, this is life. Hey, Bitcoin Hyper, you're one of the best decent crypto YouTubers. Thank you very much for saying that I'm decent decent.
