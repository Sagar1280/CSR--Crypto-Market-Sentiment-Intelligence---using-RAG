      "text": "I'm also working to ensure America remains the crypto capital of the world. >> The crypto announcements coming out of the World Economic Forum at Davos this year are wild. >> I think what's going to happen is that after market structure passes, the banks are going to get fully into the crypto industry. >> As the global elites led by America signal, >> I think the movement towards uh tokenization is is necessary. >> Crypto adoption is growing. Adopt this technology or risk being left behind. I'm very bullish and yeah, I'll go on record and say I think we'll see an all-time high. >> Here are the three biggest announcements coming out of Davos this week that affect you as a crypto holder. Watch today's whole video so you understand everything and it starts as Coinbase CEO signals. We're seeing the birth of a new monetary system, the Bitcoin standard, and he's met with some opposition. >> People think about our current financial system as kind of sacrosanked and it's the only way to do it. But, you know, if you study the history of money, really, it's got created in like 1971 when Nixon went off the gold standard in the US, and we currently have the system where most central banks don't have any link to a hard commodity underneath. Um, I think fiat currencies are going to continue to exist for a long time. Uh, but we're also seeing the birth of a new monetary system that I would call the Bitcoin standard instead of the gold standard. And in the crypto space that is a return to um you know sound money and uh something that is inflation resistant because democracies around the world once we came off the gold standard are struggling to balance their budget. They're all running deficits and it's caused inflation in fiat currencies and so there is a real segment of the population that is looking for a new system based on hard money. >> And it's amazing how early we are that central bankers still don't understand this technology. French central bank governor has to be educated that Bitcoin doesn't have a money printer. Individuals don't control the protocol unlike the big banks. >> Bitcoin doesn't have a money printer. The the supply is fixed and people will go to it in times of uncertainty kind of like they did with gold. >> Sorry to say that I trust more independent central banks with a democratic mandate than private issuers of Bitcoin >> which have a very useful role. But >> Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol. there's actually no issuer of it. So that's that's in the sense that central banks have independence, Bitcoin is even more independent. There's no country or company or individual who controls it in the world. And so anyway, I I think it's a healthy competition because um uh because if people can decide which one they trust more and I think it's actually the greatest accountability mechanism on deficit spending. And while the Clarity Act was a big topic of conversation, what will it take to get the biggest piece of crypto legislation passed, President Donald Trump used a portion of his keynote to signal to crypto investors he is ready to sign the Clarity Act when it comes to his desk because he does not want America to fall behind to China. >> And to that end, last year I signed the landmark Genius Act into law. And now Congress is working very hard on crypto market structure legislation, Bitcoin, all of them, which I hope to sign very soon, unlocking new pathways for Americans to reach financial freedom. And I did it for two reasons. Number one, I thought it was politically good. And it was. I got tremendous political report support, but more importantly, China wanted that market, too. It's just like they want the AI. And we've got that market, I think, pretty well locked up. if I didn't do it. You know, Biden was totally against it until before the election when they realized that, you know, there were millions of people voting against him over crypto and all of a sudden they loved it very much, but it was too late. They blew it. But it is politically popular, but it's it's much more importantly, we have to make it so that China doesn't get the hold of it. And once they have that hold, we're not going to be able to get it back. of course to become the crypto capital of the world. We need the Clarity Act to actually pass. David Saxs, what is the latest that you were doing to make that happen? I actually was pleasantly surprised."

David Saxs, what is the latest that you were doing to make that happen? I actually was pleasantly surprised. >> Well, yeah, there's an issue right now, the so-called yield issue of whether stable coins are going to be able to pay yield. There's a difference of opinion between the crypto industry and the banking industry. I >> what where where you where do you sit? >> I'm in favor of reaching a solution. Okay. and facilitating a compromise so that we can get a bill for market structure on the president's desk. We've seen this movie before back in August when uh the uh stable coin bill passed the Genius Act. It died about three times before it finally passed was signed into law. So some there's a process here that has to be worked through. >> What's what's a potential compromise look like? Because it looks like the banks don't want it to allow to be happen and it looks like the crypto guys are adamant that it happened that they'd be able to compete. How do is there a how do you split the baby, I guess? Well, I think the banks have to recognize that this that yield is already a feature of the Genius Act that passed and was signed into law in August. So, if the bill ends up dying, then there will be a form of rewards. And so, uh, I understand their point of view, but again, if there's no deal, then they're going to lose on this issue. >> So, the main holdup for this bill right now is the banks pushing back, but it's in their best interest to pass something because right now they have no control. the people have control based on what's already in place with the Genius Act. >> So I think it's in their interest to work something out. At the same time, I would urge the some of the crypto folks to be a little bit to see the bigger picture. Yes, I understand the yield is philosophically important to them, but so is getting an overall market structure bill. So I think if everybody takes place around everyone has an incentive to be reasonable here, I think and if they do that, we'll get a bill. >> But is it a bill comes and then there's a sort of longer fight that continues do you think afterwards? No, I mean I it's already passed the house. So if >> No, no, no. I mean that you sort of get this compromise, the banks don't love it, crypto doesn't love it, and then over time after this bill gets if this gets signed, then there's sort of a continued fight to get even more. >> Well, a good compromise is everyone leaves a little bit unhappy, right? But I I think what's going to happen is that after market structure passes, the banks are going to get fully into the crypto industry. So we're not going to have a separate banking industry and crypto industry. It's going to be one digital assets industry. And I think their opinions are going to evolve over time. And I bet you over time the banks like the idea of paying a yield because they're going to be in the stable coin business. >> But will they also be regulated the same way? And I I guess that's a big I mean the banks will say, \"Hey, if they get to do all the same things we do, how come they don't get regulated the same way?\" >> Well, I guess because they're offering slightly different products, right? So, but I mean, everyone offering the same product should be should be regulated in the same way. And we want to get to that harmonization. Now, Bitcoin in this uncertainty has just erased all of its 2026 gains after rallying 12% to 97,000 almost $98,000. Bitcoin has since pulled back to the yearly open of 87,500."

I thought this was very interesting. I found this for you. Other channels are not talking about this. I found this for you. The executive director of the President's Council Adviserss for Digital Assets, basically the new Bo Hines. Now that he went to work for Tether, the adviser for the president of the United States for digital assets comments that no bill is better than a bad bill. He's actually pushing, give the banks what they want. Let's sign a bill. No bill is better than a bad bill. What a privilege it is to be able to say those words thanks to President Trump's victory and the pro- crypto administration he has assembled. But let's not kid ourselves. There will be a crypto market structure bill. It's a question of when, not if. Assuming that a multi-t trillion dollar industry will continue to operate indefinitely without a comprehensive regulatory framework is pure fantasy. So, do we take advantage of the opportunity to pass a bill now with a pro crypto president, control of Congress, excellent regulators at the SEC and CFTC to write the rules, and a healthy industry? Or do we fumble the ball and allow Dems to write punitive legislation in the wake of a future financial crisis? Allah DoddFrank. You may not love every part of the Clarity Act, but I can guarantee you'll hate a future Dem version even more. Let's keep working to improve the product, recognizing that compromises will need to be made in order to get 60 votes in the Senate, but let's not let perfect be the enemy of good. He's not wrong. He's not wrong that a punitive administration, if it wasn't a pro- crypto administration, the potential bill would be even worse. And a multi-t trillion dollar industry, crypto, it's not going to go on much longer without getting regulated. There will be some form of regulation. But I'll add to that, let's not give, let's not repeat the mistakes of the old system. Let's not give the banks all the power again. Eric Trump on Fox Business at Davos reminds the community that monopolies hate competition and big banks are the monopoly. >> The big banks have been an absolute monopoly over our financial system for for years. You and I have joked about it a thousand times. You know, why can't you send a wire transfer past 5:00 on a on a Friday afternoon? You know why? Because the big banks would love to take, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars and have it sit there and clip interest off of it over the course of a long weekend. you know, as opposed to letting you just efficiently move that money using modern day technology, you know, and having a separate wallet two seconds later. They they want to be able to use their money. They want to be able to arbitrage your money. And so, you know, the big banks are doing everything they can to stop some of the crypto legislation for obvious reasons. Crypto adoption on a yearly basis, I know we're chopping around in the short term, but on a yearly basis is not slowing down. Black Rockck CEO Larry Frink speaks on reducing corruption via tokenization of stocks and bonds while sitting next to Citadel's Ken Griffin whose firm was found guilty of misleading and defrauding clients. >> I think the movement towards uh tokenization decimalization is is necessary. It's ironic that we see two emerging countries leading the world in decimaliz in and in in the uh to tokenization and digitization of their currency. That's Brazil and India. I think we need to move very rapidly uh to doing that. We would be reducing fees."

I think we need to move very rapidly uh to doing that. We would be reducing fees. We would do more democratization by reducing more fees if we had all investments on a tokenized platform that could move from a tokenized money market fund to equities and bonds and back and forth. We have one common blockchain. We will you know we could reduce corruption. So I would argue um that yes we have more dependencies on maybe one blockchain which we could all talk about but that being said the activities are probably processed and more secure than ever >> and obviously Larry Frink should be treated the same as the banks. He has not been our friend in the past either until he could make money on it. So it's truly important what the devil is in the details on how this industry is regulated.
