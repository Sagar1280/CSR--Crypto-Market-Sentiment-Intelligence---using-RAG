      "text": "Bitcoin has undeniable bullish momentum right now. And I actually think that it's going to be heading up right about here to about $103,000. That's where I'm planning on taking a short. And that's also where I think Bitcoin is going to roll over and fall back down. I have three different drawings, three different indicators that I'm going to be using today to show you how all three of them are overlapping to prove this point. But before I do, what's up? My name is Aaron Disher from the Better Traders. You are watching Coin Bureau Trading. Go ahead and hit the subscribe button, like this video, and let's get into it right now. The first we're going to use, the first thing is the TBO indicator. Now, this is a proprietary indicator that you get through the better traders, but still, I want to give this to you guys so you see it. We're not going to worry about TBT divergence for now. We're just going to worry about this. The reason why I think the top of the cloud, which is currently at $12,000, is a great target is because the same exact thing happened back in 2022 in March. So, if we go to 2022, go to March, the same thing happened. We saw a lot of this sideways price action. And then finally, we got a push up higher, a rally that felt so good after seeing so much bearish down moves, after seeing a new all-time high at 69K and seeing a devastating drop of 52%. We didn't fall that much, but it sure feels like it. And then we see BTC chopping sideways, and it gets a push where? Right here? To the top of the daily cloud. So, this is the slowest of the four moving averages that comprise of the TBO indicator. I also want you to see this as well. I pointed this out on my channel today. I also made a point of explaining this to people in the Better Traders Club as well. Like, guys, there's no reason to freak out about this. Once Bitcoin goes to the top of the cloud, we had plenty of time to exit. Starting from here on the 27th, sorry. Yeah, 27th of March all the way to here. It says nine bars, but Trading View doesn't count the first bar. There were 10 days where BTC was fluctuating all up in here. Okay, the last time that this happened, we had 10 days. I don't know if we're going to get that much, but I am not, I repeat, I am not expecting some sort of violent move where it just dumps like an altcoin. It's Bitcoin. It'll take more to turn the tide of momentum, but we will see it happen. Okay, so I am making my first argument based off of 2022, the 2022 bare market, moving up to the top of the cloud, which is at around $102,000 right now. Now, the next indicator that I want to show you, which is pretty wild, is actually a support level that is a very long-term support level. I actually have to zoom out all the way to show the beginning of the bull market back in 2023. And we're going to go to our long-term support fan. What is a support fan? Great question. A support fan is basically identifying the pico low and then drawing it to the next low. Duh. That's how you draw support levels. Sure. But what's this dotted line? This dotted line is showing us that there was an incrementally higher low. This one already got taken out a while ago. [snorts] And we can see right here is where the price pulled back in September 2023. And that's where this level is drawn to. We're going to go all the way back up here. Now, in November of this, rather, not this year, 2025, which still feels weird to say that. [snorts] Um, we saw support get broken here on the 17th at 92K and the price fell down a bit more down to 80K. We know the story. This is where we've been. But what you'll notice is that this level of previously broken support would actually be a very convincing level to have it flip to resistance. And what's crazy is that if it took about this much time, which I don't think it will, but if it did, it's right at about $103,000. So, we have the TBO telling us, well, there's resistance or a good target around $102,000 or so."

So, we have the TBO telling us, well, there's resistance or a good target around $102,000 or so. But we know from back in 2022 that the price went slightly above the cloud by maybe like 5% 3% whatever something like that if we do I mean that would be a push up to $17,000 maybe but it's interesting to note that overhead resistance or previous previous support but it hasn't been tested as resistance. This would be amazing. And the reason why is because this is a perfect bull flag setup. I'm sorry, not bull flag, bull trap setup. So, we're going up to resistance and we get tested. We get rejected. We go down lower and then we finally get a little bit of a bounce here on this all-time mustold level. It doesn't hold and it just keeps going lower. This has been my thesis. I still expect Bitcoin to go a lot lower this year because it is a bottom year. So without the TBO, we can still see that there is a very good chance of it pushing up Bitcoin that is up to resistance, but it won't be able to hold it. It will fall down here. It might be able to hold just briefly at 75K, but it'll most likely lose that level, break below it, test it just like we're doing right now, get rejected, and fall a lot lower over the course of this year. Now, the third one that I want to share with you next is ridiculous because this one almost seals the deal in my eyes. But before I share that with you, I need you to do me a favor. Go down to the description below, check out our exchange partners. Whether it's WEX, BY Defi, or Tubbit, all these have some fantastic rewards and bonuses for you when you sign up using the link provided down there. So, for WEX, they have this weekly lucky draw where there's a $500 bonus and a 100 winners every single week. There are also other bonuses for like BYDI where you can trade and earn up to $8,100. And even with WEX, if you deposit funds on the exchange and you hold it, you actually make money doing that as well, which is crazy. Tubbit, you can sign up and trade to earn over $15,000 USDT. And 2bit has recently been supported by the Altra platform, which is my favorite thirdparty trading platform. And there are way more deals on the Coinbureau website. If you go to coinbureau.com, go to deals.s. The first thing to check out is the Coinbau Club. This is a Discord server that has some private channels on there where Dan, my co-host on this channel, as well as Guy and Nick on the main channels are posting there. I'm also contributing a little bit to that Discord server as well. And there are other tools, other exchanges, other services for crypto that you can check out, plus a 10% off discount to the better traders course, 15 minutes to financial freedom, in which I teach you how to reduce the time you spend trading in less or rather to less than 15 minutes a day. Now, I want to review. We have TBO right here, the TBO fast, sorry, the fast line, the slow line, the top of the cloud at around $102,000 as a good target. We know in the past that the price of BTC went up just a little bit higher which means like going up to $105,000 wouldn't surprise me in the least. We also have this longterm now broken support level but it would be a perfect target for the next leg up higher which I believe that we're going to get. What's the third one? The third one's really going to knock your socks off. Okay, we're going to leave that price level there. We're going to take off the support fin for now."

The third one's really going to knock your socks off. Okay, we're going to leave that price level there. We're going to take off the support fin for now. And I need to zoom out super duper far. The reason why is because we're going to use a Fibonacci level that's drawn from back over here in 2022. Taking the 2021 November high to the 2022 November low. This gives us a Fibonacci retracement and a projection. And what's crazy is that we didn't hit our 1.618 618 Fibonacci extension like I was hoping and planning on Bitcoin doing. But what we did see happen over and over was Bitcoin struggling with the 103600 sorry3,616 level or the 1.272 level resistance resistance support goes up a little bit higher goes up to 12 something and it falls down to [snorts] 102,000. It finds support on this level. It struggles at this support level, then it goes a lot lower. Wouldn't you know that $103,616 conveniently lines up with this level, assuming we're going to have this happen by next week, which I think is likely. And again, all of all three of these levels, these Fibonacci levels, or rather an extension from the 2022 bare market, plotting a resistance level that overlaps with historical support that was previously lost that will act as resistance and the TBO slow line. We have three levels of confluence here that are telling us we should be expecting some resistance at this level. Now, can the price of BTC go up higher? Yes. And I'll tell you what, if Bitcoin happens to push up, regaining strength here at 103,000 and actually pushes up higher towards like 110 or so, I think we actually have a chance to go up a lot higher. But the reality about this move is that it's extremely unlikely given the fact that not just the TBO, but the total market cap is down and looking more and more dead by the day. We know that RSI is looking weak on the daily and the weekly time frames. Volume is down. While anything is possible, this is extremely unlikely in my book. And I think it makes way more sense to see the price of BTC going up and then finally rolling over, finding temporary support here and possibly rolling over and going a lot lower. Now, you'll notice that I have some alerts over here. This is actually a short position that I shared in the Better Traders Club. Now, I'm sharing it with you all here because I want you guys to be in the know of what I am planning. I'm also starting to build my short position pretty early. So, yes, while I think $13,000 is a good target. Yes, it could go up a little bit higher. I'm willing to suffer a little bit of short-term discomfort just in case because I don't want to miss out on getting a really good entry because the last time that this happened back in 2022, again, I cannot emphasize this enough. Entering a short here basically set you up massively, even putting your stop loss there at 9%, whatever. But we know that Bitcoin fell so much lower. This is without leverage, 61%. So even just a gentle 2x leverage position, a 2x leverage short can yield a really pretty penny. And again, those exchange partners do have futures trading available to you. So am I saying you have to do the exact thing that I'm doing? No. But I'm saying that if we're going to be seeing a similar outcome like we saw back over here in 2022 with a final push up to the top of the cloud, a rejection, and further downside continuation, I want to be positioned to profit on the way down."

Now, you do have to factor in that if you're going to have a position like that, then yes, it means that you're going to be waiting on that position to eventually acrew a ton of fees, and that's going to be unpleasant. But again, you could also just consider scaling out of your positions, too. You don't have to actually go crazy with it and keep it open forever, and that's not what I'm suggesting. But I do think that we have a much greater chance of going down than moving up. Now, I need you to watch this video. It's going to pop up right up there because this is going to help set the stage of where I think we're heading in this year. And until the next time, you know what to do. Stay awesome and stay in the green. Peace."
