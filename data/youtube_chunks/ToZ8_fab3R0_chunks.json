      "text": "[music] We recently just got some beautiful volatility within the market. A lot of the coins have started to move into the final take-profit zone. So, we're going to make some adjustments to at least the trades that we have on the table today in this video. So, stay tuned until the very end. We'll also look if there is any new trade opportunities. Don't go anywhere. I actually have one trade opportunity for you guys today. [music] So, uh stay until the end for that. Um it's a little bit of an unconventional one. very very very low risk in my opinion. And then on top of that, we're going to do the $1,000 giveaway. Smash the like button. Uh and let's get straight into it. So, we will do the $1,000 giveaway. I see a bunch of you signed up to Bit Unix if you want to participate in that. Again, tomorrow I'll do $1,000 every day that um we have enough people joining into that. All you have to do is use the link in the description below, sign up to Bit Unix, and immediately you'll be entered into that competition. But this is limited to the first 1,000 people, right? So, as soon as we hit that number, um, of course, we have to stop with the giveaway. So, Dash over there up still 30% on the day. Pretty decent. But now you're starting to see a bit of a a pullback. So, I'm sure many of you are wondering, and this is the question of the day, is, you know, are we reaching a point of exhaustion? Are we nearing a local top? Are we going to start to see a pullback over here, or we just going to rip straight through for continuation? These are the things on people's minds and that's what I'm here today to address. But not only that, I actually want to take it a step further and I want to talk about uh what would start to reposition at least my mindset in the sense that we've been saying that short-term bullish leading into resistance is simply a relief rally and medium to high time frame bearish. We expect in the medium term things are probably going to get faded to a certain extent and on the high time frame we pretty much in the bare market territory very similar to the price cycles following this uh pink trajectory over here. So you can see what comes next after that if you look at this as a fractal just correlating to what happened in the price cycles. We expecting that you're probably going to bleed through. Now know that that's not everybody's thought process because I can go to the polls over here and I can see what you guys voted. I said the question is will you offload these positions on the pump that we experiencing or are you simply going to hold for higher and then I posed the question um you know step number one bull market not over you're holding on that's 40% of you 40% of you believe that my thesis around this actually being the start of the bare market and we're probably going to continue down um is wrong that's what 40% of the votes believe over here and I want to show you what would flip my bias as well so don't go anywhere we'll talk about that today and then offloading and de-risking big because you are under a lot of pressure and pain when prices went down into the lower 80k region. That's 26% of you. I want to um you know just encourage you guys to remember those feelings, right? Remember how you felt. Um many of those altcoins haven't recovered and probably won't. But let's just pretend that you were purely in Bitcoin. If you drew down like 36% almost 40% and now you're coming back to that point of of break even or even slight profits. Remember what it felt like to be drawn down so aggressively. And I'll show you also what the the bears would want to see if you are going to get bearish continuation. We'll talk about that today. And then we got 28% of you that say, you know, you've been out for a long time. That's probably that's about an eye clicked, right? I've been out for a long time. I'm simply just trading the market. the best trades that present themselves. I take those trades. Now, I want to talk about, you know, what needs to happen for me to reallocate in a big way with spot, right? Meaning, I'm back in I'm back in the market. I'm looking for higher upside."

I'll show you what that what that would look like today. Uh, smash the like button, guys. Let's go. So, first we'll go into commodities, stocks, um, and anything else that we need to cover in this section. As always, uh, gold had a little bit of a flush, continuing to mount towards the upside. So I expect that this being brought up over here is going to lead to continuation. That's all looking good. Silver also quite a deep flush over there. You actually took out yesterday's low which I can imagine there must have been a lot of trailing stop losses over there and the fact that it's already being brought up means that I think this is probably going to continue higher as well. I don't think that this rally is over yet. Um, you know, these things are trading so similar to what crypto did in the prior cycles when you had like these alt seasons and you just have these like parabolas and then massive flashes out of nowhere for this to only resume like 48 hours, 72 hours later. You trading back at new highs. So, probably going to be the case over there. Our platinum trade did not get stopped out. It flushed yesterday's low. Um, basically still in that trade. In my opinion, you can now raise the bar right now. Now, you want to be trailing that stop loss under today's low so you can raise the bar over there, eliminate some further risk if you maybe were too scared to get into the position where you have a crystal clear entry on platinum entering exactly right over here. Stop loss goes below the low. If you come back below this low later on today or tomorrow, the next day, you are going to be taking out all of these lows and this is going to roll over. I don't necessarily think that's the case. And then if we look at uh copper as well, big sweep down. You obviously want follow through on copper. Copper is wild. Remember what we saw previously? I think this candle over here is um a 18% down candle, right? 18% over there, which is absolutely enormous on the daily. Quickly going into the stock market. So, the S&P 500 just chopping about, but still grinding up slowly but surely. Pretty much alltime highs. Dow Jones still bullish. Uh NASDAQ, we kept a very tight entry. I got taken out of the trade. You can see where my stop loss was. It is unfortunate because it comes directly into support. So theoretically there's still a valid trade, but I wanted to see um the fourth candle. So you had three candles um above that trend line over there. We wanted to see that follow through. It got flushed yesterday. Of course there's a lot of tensions, right? Tensions in geopolitical environments with threats against uh Iran, right? US Iran, things like that are going to drive more volatility. And I think that's the theme for this entire year is increased volatility expected. there's going to be those wild um swings within the market. So, I'll have to allocate a new entry into the NASDAQ trade. But for now, I'm taking out that's the first loss for the year, right? We have a couple of other trades. Um and those are all in profit. So, Tesla still holding up, still fighting for this level over here. It will take a couple of days or even weeks to get going. Um but no changes over there on that trade. Let me just see is there anything else that we had to look at. Let's just do a quick run through over there. So, no comments on Google. Uh, Apple, um, you know, Apple, we were in the short trade. Worth taking a bit of profits."

Worth taking a bit of profits. This is this is one that I'll show you how to do it if you took it on, uh, Pinex, just to show you guys how to take profit on both shorts and longs. Okay, Nvidia still just chopping about. Meta looks bad. Microsoft is coming back for that pink box. Amazon could be deviating the highs, but we don't have any trades on there. Coinbase is still chopping about at the bottom of the parallel channel also um into that that gap that occurred over there. Uh circle still terrible. Robin Hood similar to Nvidia chopping about and then we had the Micro Strategy trade you know putting in a bit of relief but worth also taking some profits if you didn't already. I do ultimately think this will rerate much much much lower at a later date. So, in a moment, I'll show you how to navigate these trades over here that we have open if you followed through with the bots because remember once I make changes on this, it's not going to automatically do it for you. You can copy the bots and the settings. Um, this is for Pinex. It's all linked below for anyone new. If you want to copy those, they are linked below over here. But once I make changes, you need to watch the show. That's why you must come here every day. And then, of course, you can just adjust it. I want to show you how to do that in this video. First, let's quickly go into uh what's going on on the whale trade site over here. First big standout 61 61 on the fear and greed. We spoke about this. We said that probably you're going to move back. We actually said into doubt or you've officially re-entered into cautious optimism. So, the [clears throat] bulls are back, right? The bulls are back. They're coming back at least in terms of sentiment over there. If we look at the real um sentiment index which is going to be looking at the funding rates well this could um you know uh squeeze a little bit higher because you're still in uncertainty which is the same environment we had been hovering between which you can see over here hovering between panic and uncertainty which means funding rates slightly negative which drove a lot of that price towards the upside in the form of a short squeeze. Um let me just see over here if I can refresh this and get that data we might have an issue with the pool. If um if okay there we got it back. Okay so if we have a look at the data over here 259 million worth of shorts got squeezed but the day before that was around 600 million. So as if this continues to remain in uncertainty or panic well you could see a bit of a further squeeze. I want to show you the price levels. It's the low $100,000 region just to give you a spoiler alert. That's what you're going to be looking at to potentially fade. Um, all righty. So, daily exchange volume, slight slight slight uptick over there. Uh, we need a bit more time to monitor this, but um, for the most part, it's still down trending. Uh, okay. What else have we got? Anything else noteworthy? ETF flows on the dailies, big upticks. Remember, when you get the strong weekly flows, uh, you typically want to counter this. Is this a big enough weekly inflow? I guess the week's not over. Let's give it a bit more time. Um, if you do get something like that, most of the local tops occur on the huge inflows and then we look for bottoms when you get consecutive weeks of outflows. That's for BTC. If we look at ETH, ETH very, very, very lackluster flows."

If we look at ETH, ETH very, very, very lackluster flows. I wonder how um Tom Lee is feeling, right? Fun Strat Tom Lee. Um, obviously the big ETH bull that's trying to use the the micro strategy playbook over there. Um, we got the trading calendar for today. Quick look at that. Uh I do think we have some data coming out as like the jobs reports or something. Initial jobless claims that's coming out today. Okay, moving on. We have the deltas over here. The difference between the longs and the shorts in the very very very short term because we update this right before the shows. Slightly positive positive positive. Um liquidations still building on the downside over there. And then over here we do have spot which is still in the market. That's the important one, right? Spot buyers are still in. As long as this remains towards the upside, I would expect a few more shorts to get squeezed. So, let's make a couple of changes. The first thing that I'd want to do is given where uh Monero is, we've hit the target, right? We've had a full trade play out. I think that it's pretty reasonable to expect that this might start to pull back from here. So, for anyone that missed this, this is how you're going to find your entry if this is going to continue to be parabolic. What you want to be looking at is um a couple of different points. I'm going to anchor from the bottom of this move to the top and we're going to just highlight it so we don't have like fib levels all over the place making a big mess and then we'll look for the most confluence zones. Right? So bottom to top and then I also want to look at the origin of the move which is going to basically take that a little bit further. So that is our um potential point of entry which is going to be coming into this yellow box pullback. We will assess what that pullback looks like. Something like this. If you start to find some support that takes Monero or the ticker is going to be XMR down to about like 560 anywhere between 560 and 650. So I'm giving about a $100 range is going to be where you probably want to reallocate. So you can take some profits over here because we have met the takerit zone. We got that takeprofit based on the breakout, right? The breakout level over here. And I'll just highlight that super quick for you. So, we looked at the cup and handle formation. This was the measured move of that cup and handle breakout and that came exactly through the target, right? 740. We hit like a tick below um 800 was like 798 or something was the level. So, if you've been trading these bots, how do you take profit? I already took some this morning, but I'll do it again now just to show you. Monero, I was raking up like $7,000 in profits over there. You go to details into there. You go more. Then you're going to go add or reduce your investment. You're going to click reduce the investment of course if you want to take profit. And then this is it. Like I'm taking 5% profit, 10% profit, 50% profit, and so forth. Right? So you do want to pay yourself. I took 25% profit. So I'm going to take I'm going to actually go as much as about another 35% profit over here. So I'm taking another like $3,200 out. Uh there it is. And that's it. You've taken profit. The beauty is it's not going to affect your P&L score."

So you can still go and take screenshots and share it in all your favorite trading groups and Twitter and send it to your family and friends to show them how you bought the bottom and they all missed out, right? You still have that ability which is which is wonderful for your egos, right? Um I love it as well. Don't don't get me wrong. Next, let's look at Pippen. This one is still doing okay. I'm going to go before we go into the BTC analysis while we at it. Let's just uh look at some of these trades, right? What's going on on Pippen? Are we going to continue to hold the short trade? Well, given that the rest of the market has moved up and this thing is still struggling, I'm going to maintain my short exposure over here. I'm not going to um close this position. You're consolidating uh you know, at these levels over here, which looks like it's going to threaten this low. As soon as we take our 29 cents on Pippen, we know the short trade is in the money and we're good to go. So, hence the thumbnail, right? There's some longs, there's some shorts. We're making some adjustments over here. Um, you know, uh, this is what it's about. It's about trading the market in both directions. ETH trade. Let's quickly look at ETH. What's going on on that? Because we are long on Ethereum as well. Beautiful, beautiful trade over there. We're moving on to the daily given the recent demand that's just come back into the market over here. I'm going to leave ETH. I think that this can rerate higher, right? I still think that this can move higher. So, ETH, no changes on that position. Tesla, we just covered. I'm leaving that long trade on the table. I'm not adjusting anything over there. Apple, you know, it's not that much. I already took profit on this trade, but if you want to, you guys know what to do. You can take a bit more. I'll just do it for the purpose of the um of the explanation over here. So, you go to reduce investment and we'll we'll shape some over here. Right. Let's just let that load up. There we go. Let let that load up. Let that load up. Why is it taking so long? Okay. And what other ones do we have? We have gold as well. While we wait for that. Okay, it's loaded up. So, you know, whatever. Let's take 20% off the table. So 20% um Oh, I I'm actually realizing a small loss because of the funding fees over there. Uh is what it is, right? We got gold, right? Let's actually I said gold I think is going to continue higher. So I'm not going to make any change on gold, but when we hit that first takeprofit is probably worth shaving a bit. Micro strategy, I already shaved a little bit of that position, but I'm going to hold the rest over here. Um and those are the positions. The other one that we had open was NASDAQ, which I took out. This is a soft stop because it's a grid order. So, I manually went and I closed that position. Okay. Um, let me check the comments over here. See where you guys are at. Everyone's all good. Smash the like button, guys, if that helps you out. Smash the like button. I don't really know other people that come and take you through holding your hand like this. So, um, I think there's a lot of value in the free shows, right? The free shows over here. So, just smash the like button. That's that's all that it costs you. Moving on. All right, let's have a look."

So, just smash the like button. That's that's all that it costs you. Moving on. All right, let's have a look. So, a couple of things that need to happen. If to flip me back bullish on the market and to start to look for swing long positions, I would need to see price consolidating like this underneath the purple line, which is going to be 5.354%. Otherwise, this is all part of higher highs and higher lows. A big push up into the resistance level. Fourth time breakout. That means pull back into here as support. next attempt is almost certainly going to explode USDT dominance through this level. If USDT dominance goes through this level, big trouble for the rest of crypto, which is why I pose that question, what are you doing? Are you offloading or d-risking big? I mean, I think that it's something valid to consider because you can always get back long again if this is proven incorrect. So, for example, D-risk into that level. If it's proven incorrect, well, you should see price consolidating under here. And your opportunity cost is the distance between those two lines and you can just get long again, right? That's that's at least what I would do. But it's up to you. It's your money. You do you. Um you have your own thesis. You have your own time horizon as well. Now, coming into this chart, you've w directly into the 50. You've started to reject. The week is not over and there is momentum behind the bulls over here. Part of the relief rally. I want to remind you if we go back on this chart, this was our intended targets which is going to be above those levels. So things will get interesting if Bitcoin can start to break above the 21 EMA and it can start to angle it up which won't take a lot because this is an exponential moving average which means it gives uh a higher waiting to the more recent price action which is starting to trend up. So you can see how it's already flattening out. It's still downtrending, which means if Bitcoin trades above here, it can very quickly start to reposition up and then I would have to consider entering into some swing long positions. The stop and reversal indicator over there is still also acting as resistance, which means if you pierce that, and I want to remind you at the time when this broke over here, this is when the this is um there you go. It broke it on this candle. So this down candle over here which closed at $115,000 I told you guys at the time take it very seriously when you break these stop and reversals this is the pain that you could have avoided. So let's say even if you recover and you get back above this well you avoided all of this um absolute emotional disaster over here which could have led to much much much lower prices. So if you break that again same thing that I said over here take it seriously when you break it take it seriously when you break it. So if you break it towards the upside and that stop and reversal pops below, those tend to act as support governing price higher and higher and then we can re-evaluate. Right? So that's one of the things that I'm looking at over there. Getting back above the 50 EMA, back above the 21 EMA and breaking the stop and reversal indicator would be a very at least cautiously optimistic sign, which is where the sentiment currently resides in cautious optimism. 61 on the fear and greed index. If I saw something like that, um, I would start to re-evaluate and look for new positions. But it's not the case right now. Everything happening right now, we have to treat as lower high territory."

If I saw something like that, um, I would start to re-evaluate and look for new positions. But it's not the case right now. Everything happening right now, we have to treat as lower high territory. You can see total 3 hasn't even got into that 50% level around 980 billion. Total one. Trillion. And then total 3 big resistance at 3.5 trillion. So I would like to see above and beyond Bitcoin breaking above that stop and reversal indicator, the 21 EMA and the 50 EMA. I would like to see total um one at least consolidate then back above 3.5 trillion and recover some of these breakdown levels which is actually 3.8 trillion which means there's going to be months and months and months of work because none of this stuff happens overnight. This is a weekly chart. It basically means uh for bulls to win you basically need to see something like this consolidate here. Then I would have to go and take a fib from the low to wherever the local high is. And then I would expect, and I'll use the highlighter to make it clear. I would then expect um wait, where's our highlighter? There we go. I would then expect a pullback into there to perform a high loan. Only at that point would I start to allocate into spot positions and say, you know what, maybe uh the 2026 bull run theorists are correct and we're going high. But as you can see, for now, that's not the case. The base case remains. Look for lower highs. look for um this or or treat this as a relief rally which is still what it is. Uh very similar to what we had back in 2022, right? So 2021 top came down over here 2022 relief into that actually broke back above the super guppy indicator but didn't last long and it failed. So we need consecutive weekly closes for now. Volume is coming. That's the one at least bullish thing that's taking place. Real volume is coming in. you've broken above the green line which is going to be your point of control. Um but you need to sustain above that to invalidate the bare flag otherwise it's still valid. So be careful be careful in those environments. Um, we got the long trade, we took multiple other long trades. Everything is working out over here for now, but it's profit taking environments in my personal opinion. D-risking uh zone, right? So, the momentum oscillate is still riding towards the upside and this is the big big big area. I'm going to price stable it. This is your huge massive zone of resistance around that 103K zone. So, you know, you could rally up to about 106K. This is going to be the big area. If you can see, if you can start to take that out, this is where things begin to change. And I'll make it um let let's put it like the green zone, right? We'll change that to green and we'll make it nice and big four points over here because that's the main area. If you can shift the structure by getting above that, that will be looking really really good. But we're not there yet, right? This is all resistance and the expectation is higher that it will fail then not. Okay, so we've covered BTC. You guys know it. There's the trade. It should be crystal clear. Entry uh final take profit over there. Why? Before the key 50% level. I'm going to highlight it. There it is on the right before the key 50% level taken from the actual all-time highs down to the recent lows. Well, we expect price will struggle to get through there. And that's why we would want to exit some of those positions before then or BD risk before then. If it smashes through, all you have to do is wait for the pullback."

You'll probably still get long at the same price that you exited or even possibly maybe a little bit lower which gives you a better entry. Um, so those are the thought processes for the market. That's exactly how I'm trading it. Um, you know, we've gone through a whole bunch of different trades over here. We've gone through Monero. There is still remember the short trade idea that I gave as well for yesterday which we're coming into the area of interest. We haven't hit yet hit it. It will be an absolute um you know perfect setup if BTC comes into this zone 100 101,300 up to 106 and we start to sense and see weakness into that environment while simultaneously Tron tags this level at 31 cents then you can start to look for the short. So, um, uh, you know, as the comment suggests, no rush to short. Exactly. There's no rush. Definitely no rush. Not while bulls have the momentum. Um, that's why we look for the long trades. Most missed it, unfortunately, because they were still on holiday. But for those of you that got it, congratulations. And now you're looking to take that profit and not short yet. We need to see a bit more weakness in my opinion to just have a higher a more high confident short position, which is very close. Let's see percentage wise, you know, for that's 3.4% away for uh Tron and for BTC, you're anywhere between about 4% and like maximum 9% away. So to long here for 9% is insane because that's where your maximum risk comes into place on the long trade where you would expect that possibly things could start to fail. Now remember, a wick above this doesn't validate a long thesis because you could easily see a spike up and then immediately um that closes as a wick below on a daily and that would be an even more confident short trade. So take out the liquidity over here where a lot of people have their stops and then fail back below. But time will tell, time will tell. We'll see what happens. Um XMR short, absolutely not. I definitely wouldn't do that. Vetti Goat. I definitely definitely wouldn't short Monero which has got some of the the most strength, right? It's more about taking profits on the original trade setup because we hit it. That was the plan. Stick to the plan. The plan was enter here, take profit here. Stick to the plan. Pay yourself a little bit. We did it. We paid ourselves a bit. Now, let it settle, right? Leave some on the table because what may happen, this thing could go absolutely wild. Like, this thing could trade over $1,000 for all we know. If it settles over here, finds support and goes for another leg and rips, you know, it it this thing can go it can go absolutely crazy, especially especially if Bitcoin repositions high by recapturing some of these and a lot of sideline capital starts to re-enter into the market. Uh we trade the market that we have, right? We're not here to be fortune tellers. We're here to adapt. We have a theory of where the market is going, but if that theory is invalidated, we reposition. You have to. Okay. You have to have to have to. Okay. So, if you want to copy those bots, guys, you know what to do. Link in the description below if you want to follow along with the next trade. Get a Pinex um account over there. You get a $1,000 signup bonus. And then we'll go into the giveaway for Bit Unix, right? The $1,000 giveaway. Um let's get straight into that. So, we have a whole bunch of new people that joined yesterday."

Get a Pinex um account over there. You get a $1,000 signup bonus. And then we'll go into the giveaway for Bit Unix, right? The $1,000 giveaway. Um let's get straight into that. So, we have a whole bunch of new people that joined yesterday. Um so today let's do more a oneshot uh cannon launch approach of just giving to one person. Yes. Yesterday what we did is we spread it amongst everyone that had joined. Today let's do the cannonball approach. One one shot, right? One shot. $1,000 goes to one individual. So the way that it's split is from cell number 29 down to cell number um 55. And what I'll do is I'll make this a bit bigger. There we go. Just so you guys can see. So again, I've got it from cell number 29 to 55. We're going to spin once, generate the winner, and if that lands on your user ID or your row, your user ID will be funded with $1,000. So, congratulations to cell number 46 or row number 46. Who is number 46? So, 46, we're going over here. 46. There it is. I'm just going to put in in on the side of here. $1,000. There we go. They seem to have deposited $400. That was my recommendation because you get a big sign up bonus on $400 like the sweet spot. Uh anything from $400 and upwards, you're getting the best signup bonus. So, if your user ID number is 416 um76, let's just read it again. 416767174, you are the winner. You can just screenshot that. If that's your user ID and you joined yesterday, you won $1,000. Congratulations. Don't get wrecked. Um, you know, maybe buy some milk and and eggs and stuff. Get some real world assets, right? Real world assets out there. Speaking of which, I actually want to talk about real world assets because, um, there's figure markets. Figure markets gives you an opportunity to uh, you know, essentially stake. So, for those of you, you know, if you want to put your idol money um to work and get a shot as well to win some additional capital, they have uh they currently have an opportunity over there. It's all linked in the description below. So, if you go through to the description and you go through to figure markets, um they're US regulated fintech company. They're letting you earn up to 9% yield, which is actually paid hourly, which is absolutely insane. And they're lending into institutional grade markets. And it's actually backed by real world assets, right? Not DeFi gimmicks or any of these high-risk kind of things. Um, and you get to keep ownership of your capital. So, they're currently running an opportunity where if you deposit capital, so for every dollar that you deposit and you put into yields into one of the yields to earn that 9%, um, you're getting an entry for what's called one sweep stake entry. And at the end of 25 days, you have to leave it in there for 25 days. They're going to give um $25,000 away. The number one first prize winner is going to get $20,000. You can enter up to $25,000, meaning you get 25,000 sweep stake entries and then I guess it becomes like a bit of a raffle to see who wins. It's randomized like pretty much what I just did over here. It's randomized to choose the winner. So the sweep stake entry is a pure upside. Pure upside on top of the interest, right? your money is not gone. This is not a lottery where you put 10 grand in and they take the 10 grand um to to give to you know one winner. It's not a lottery. It's just pure extra upside for you guys if you do want to participate. There's a link in the description below. Figure markets. They do a lot. They do a whole lot of stuff. Go and check it out. Very interesting stuff, right? Um you can see home equity line of credit loans. Insane. They do a lot of stuff."

Very interesting stuff, right? Um you can see home equity line of credit loans. Insane. They do a lot of stuff. It's all real world asset stuff. Um, so yeah, linked in the description if you guys want to see it. Let's go into a few altcoin requests over there and um and have a look what else is going on. Quick look at XRP. Um, you know, hovering around here. Nothing to write home about. I don't see a clean entry. Salana, no man's land for me personally. So, still grinding on upwards, but no man's land. Uh, big resistance coming into play for Suie. You need to recapture this $2.15. We got Sonic. It the the aggressiveness of the downtrend is beginning to slow. So the best case scenario is that you start to probably form a bit of a trading range. Uh probably something like that in that yellow box over there. Uh say also probably start to form a bit of a trading range. We covered Cardano yesterday. AAX, we covered uh let's just move on. We've covered these. So we found the short trade over there on Tron uh pump recapturing a key level, right? Not bad. Not bad. This has recaptured a key level. Again, I think it's unlikely that it just moons from here. But if you are looking for an entry, best way to do it is look for the pullbacks into the 50% levels. 0.002362. Okay. Um hype. Okay. Still coming down. A still ranging. Uh there we go. Lighter. We said from local top to bottom. Typically these things go down 70%. You may get this under a dollar. very very very hard to predict on these new things because there's so many mechanics at work. So many airdrop people wanting to dump. There's just a lot going on. See Pippen's coming down a bit more. Right. So, uh there we go. 6% down. Very nice. 6% down. So, hopefully we'll be in the money soon. Um okay, back into this. Let's have a look at what else is moving. Anything else noteworthy? We got uh S&P. I saw one of you in the chat over there for SPX. Look, theoretically you could probably be long with a stop below, but these are all very high-risk trades. Very, very, very high-risisk trades. Is AA dead? Says Arnold. I don't think AA is dead. I think it's one of the main ones to watch actually. Like, if I am going to allocate into something, these are one of my top considerations. I don't like to fade someone like CZ. I've often found that once you, you know, put in the big move, you you get the FOMO buys in, they dump on them. you tend to put in these rounded bottoms. So 70% down, you know, you tend to put in this this rounded bottom, something like that, and then reaccumulate and move back towards the top. Okay. So I wouldn't be surprised to see something like that, but I need to give it a bit more time. It's still too early for uh me to worry about, you know, this suddenly doing this now. I don't think that's the case. I think probably range for a while longer. So we'll we'll revaluate later, especially depending on what Bitcoin does. Okay. All right. Uh, what else? What else, guys? Let me just check the comments if there's anything specific over here. Something that um is a common theme that you guys want to go over. I'll just do a quick scan through over here. What's butthole doing? A little bit of a It's being propped up a little bit, but the the butthole is being spread very wide. If you if you got into this early or I mean well it is early. I mean it's it's late in terms of buying but early in it in its cycle you would be down 99.93%. So these things are brutal."

I felt like there's something on the bottom over here I needed to go over from earlier. Is it No, I think we covered we covered over there. So that is all over there for you. Um, let me know in the comments as well, guys. What do you want more of? It will be really helpful if you let me know in the comments. Not in the live chat, but once the show ends, please do smash the like button and then go through to the comment section as well. Let me know if you enjoyed the addition of me talking about things like stocks and um commodities and the equities and things like that. Uh, you know, is this valuable to you? You need to let me know below. Do you want more of that? Do you want more crypto? Do you want none of that? Let me know the kind of split that you guys want for these shows cuz it's your show as much as it is mine. That's it from me. I'll see all of you on the next one. I hope you all have a lovely day wherever you are in the world. Cheers. [music]"
