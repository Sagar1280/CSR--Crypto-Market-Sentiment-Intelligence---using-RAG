      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coin Bureau Trading. Today, we're going to talk about why this week is going to be a big week for the crypto market. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different. And if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, the first reason guys why this week is going to be crazy for crypto uh has to do uh with of course the Department of Justice announcing that it's investigating Fed Chairman Jerome Pal. Of course, you guys will know that the Trump administration has basically been trying to take control of the Federal Reserve. And what's really interesting is that crypto prices actually rallied on the news and that suggests to me that later today once US markets open, we're probably going to see a continuation higher in the crypto market as people see crypto as kind of being like a, you know, a currency that's independent of the Federal Reserve and independent of these politics. even though that's not technically true, but uh we'll get more into the impacts this is having on the market in just a second. Uh the second catalyst to keep in mind uh tomorrow we're going to be getting the CPI print for December. Uh I do think that the inflation print the CPI will come in lower than expected simply because oil prices and rental prices fell uh in December compared to November. And if you guys follow a true uh it's a kind of this crypto project that tracks inflation in real time, they are already showing inflation being below 2%. So, the CPI should come in significantly lower than expected. Investors are expecting 2.7%. It'll probably come in way lower than expected. Uh, as a fun fact, guys, you might know that I had predicted that the previous CPI print would come in lower than expected based on oil prices and rental prices. Uh, the previous CPI from November. Um, you can go back and check that if you want to verify that, but when it comes to analyzing inflation, in my opinion, it's pretty simple. Just look at oil prices and rental prices in the US and the previous month, and that'll tell you roughly which way inflation is going to go. Uh anyways, the third uh catalyst of course guys to keep in mind here is one that was was actually supposed to happen uh last week and that was basically the Supreme Court probably striking down Trump's tariffs that was expected to be announced last Friday and it was basically pushed to this Wednesday so January 14th which means that again today we have basically this whole scuffle with the Fed that's probably going to be all over the news probably going to result in some inflows into crypto as of this narrative that you know well we're already seeing also gold and everything rally right uh where people are saying oh we're going to diversify into assets that are not politicized or whatever, right? Not the US dollar. Then we have the CPI that's likely to come in lower than expected, which should actually increase the chances that the Fed is going to cut rates. And then we have the Supreme Court likely to strike down Trump's tariffs. Of course, uh I think the Trump administration has already said that they might introduce tariffs in a different way. Um so it's going to be interesting to see how that impacts the market. Um but in the short term, if those tariffs are struck down, then basically the combination of all three of these factors should cause the US dollar to fall. And of course, as you guys know, the US dollar is basically inversely correlated to the crypto market. So when the US dollar goes up, the crypto market tends to go down. And when the US dollar goes down, the crypto market tends to go up. What we're looking at here is the US dollar index on the 4hour chart. And you can see every single time the dollar index got overbought on the 4hour chart going back over the last few months or even few years. Every single time it gets overbought in the short term, it enters kind of like a short-term downtrend that lasts for about, you know, about a week or two."

Every single time it gets overbought in the short term, it enters kind of like a short-term downtrend that lasts for about, you know, about a week or two. We can see that happened in October. That happened in November. It happened uh in de I well I guess there wasn't anything in December but you can see now that we are in overbought territory or or rather we were in overbought territory for the US dollar here on the 4-hour chart which suggests that over the next week or two we should see the dollar f fall falling quite considerably and that's going to basically be a bullish uh macro tailwind for the crypto market. And this is where things get really interesting guys. So, if you've been keeping up with my uh content, you'll know that uh what's been really interesting about this pullback here, and this is actually something I had noted, I think at the start of November. I said, \"Hey, of last year, I said, \"Hey, we could see a repeat of kind of like this um you know, kind of like capitulation like fake out uh dip that we saw below the Ballinger band moving average on the weekly.\" This is the total crypto market cap, by the way. Uh basically, over the summer of last year, of course, we did see roughly like something like 3 months or four months below this key level. And then we saw that again happen in the spring of 2025. And then for the last couple of months here, we've been below the Ballinger band moving average on the weekly again. And what I basically uh proposed is like, you know, it's possible that we're seeing history repeat in the sense that we're going to get a rally, let's say, in the next couple of weeks back up to the Ballingerband moving average here on the weekly. And I'll show you what that means for each crypto individually in just a second. Um, but in the next basically week or two, we should see a rally back up to this level. And at that point, we can say, okay, are prices going to get rejected from that level and then enter a bare market or will prices break above that level and continue heading higher? Uh in the short term again the main thing to watch is that the US dollar is likely going to fall because of these three catalysts that I just noted that's likely to happen this week pro potentially continue into next week falling dollar is a bullish tailwind on the macro front for the crypto market which basically increases the chances that we will see a rally up here to the Ballinger band moving average on the weekly for the total crypto market cap and in terms of what that means for individual cryptos. Um for Bitcoin that would be a rally probably somewhere to around 100,000. That's where the Ballinger band moving average is here on the weekly. For Ethereum, that would mean a rally somewhere up to 3,600. Uh, and for Salana, that would be a rally somewhere up to around 170, which would actually be a pretty sizable move. Uh, it wouldn't be that surprising given that, of course, Salana's part of this like uh not only tokenization narrative, but I think they just announced that they're going to be integrating with X or something like that. I haven't had the chance to look into the details yet, but uh looks like there could be a pretty sizable rally for Salana. Similar idea here for Suie, probably rallying up to around uh $2 or $2.3 uh in the next week or two. You can see that is a key resistance zone uh that we've seen or rather key support zone now resistance that we've seen throughout this cycle. So the idea that Sooie would rally up to this level and then again what happens after that we're going to have to wait and see."

Will Bitcoin break above that level? Uh will Salana break above that level? Will Suie break above that level? Will the total crypto market cap break above this key resistance level? We'll have to wait and see. Uh and that could depend partially on what happens with the Clarity Act uh in the coming weeks. As you guys will know, the Clarity Act basically sets uh regulations for the broader crypto market. And I've been pointing out that the Clarity Act is similar to the Genius Act, where leading up into the Genius Act, we saw crypto prices rallying. We saw crypto prices rallying after the Genius Act was passed. And so we could see history repeat, and of course, the Genius Act is going to be discussed later this week, I believe, on Thursday. So, we have again Monday like today, the this Department of Justice stuff into Powell. Uh tomorrow, we have the uh inflation print, which is likely to come in lower than expected. And then we have the Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday and then on Thursday we have the Clarity Act. So it yes, it is going to be a pretty crazy week for the crypto market. Uh and uh it's going to be really interesting to see what happens. As I had mentioned at the start of the month, I do think that crypto prices will rally into this kind of debate. And assuming the debate goes well, then we should see prices rallying uh during the debate and then also after uh the Clarity Act becomes law. And I'm sure a lot of people will say, \"Oh, it's going to be priced in or it's already priced in.\" The thing is guys that it's not really possible to to price in a structural change to the crypto market, right? We're not dealing with just like something that oh uh the government is buying Bitcoin or whatever. We're dealing with a fundamental shift to how the crypto market is is treated. Same way with the Genius Act, like introducing stable coin regulations. Uh you know, you can't really price that in because you don't know like how many banks are going to get involved. What does this mean in terms of how big crypto stable coins are going to grow? Um you know, what does this mean for certain chains? That's something that's very hard for the markets to price in. And I think that's exactly why we saw such a big rally heading into the Genius Act being uh approved and then the rally continued even after the Genius Act was approved because people are starting to understand and starting to speculate on how big this could be because you are dealing with a fundamental shift to how stable coins are treated in the United States. And we're about to see the same thing happen here with the Clarity Act. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the SEC is also expected to introduce its exemptive relief uh uh order uh sometime this month. So potentially that could be the catalyst that causes the crypto prices to break above these key resistance levels and continue higher. Similarly to the last two times we saw this in this cycle basically rallying up to this level and then breaking higher to new all-time highs potentially it could either be the Clarity Act or the SEC's innovation exemption which again is also expected sometime later this month. But with all of that said guys I do need to caution that even though Bitcoin, believe it or not, Bitcoin did not open a CME gap over the weekend but there is still this unfilled CME gap from New Year's Day somewhere around 88,100."

But with all of that said guys I do need to caution that even though Bitcoin, believe it or not, Bitcoin did not open a CME gap over the weekend but there is still this unfilled CME gap from New Year's Day somewhere around 88,100. Uh and I do believe that uh Ethereum and Salana did open CME gaps over the weekend and they also still have some unfilled CME gaps at lower levels. Um so just keep that in the back of your in the back of your mind that if these catalyst on the off chance were were to come in extremely bearish then we could see a filling of these CME gaps. But just on a personal note, I do think that you know if there's no CME gap for Bitcoin from this weekend, then you're not going to have that. You can think of Bitcoin as kind of being like gravity, right, for the for the whole crypto market. um if Bitcoin doesn't have any gravity pulling it down because it doesn't have a CME gap, it's possible that we're not going to see that CME gap closed by these other altcoins. Or alternatively, you know, it could be a situation where Bitcoin blasts off, altcoins kind of pull down a little bit in the short term uh because of like, you know, whatever this DOJ stuff with the Fed uh and then altcoins catch up after that, that's certainly a possible scenario. But just in my mind, if there's no gravity pulling down Bitcoin and of course Bitcoin acts as like gravity for the whole crypto market, then and again there's no CME gap, well besides this one here at 88,100. Um, since there's no CME gap from over this weekend, it's possible that Bitcoin will first grind higher, taking the rest of the crypto market with it. And then we would see a drop and a filling of that CME gap sometime later this month or early next month. Um, as the crypto market either rolls over into a bare market or just has a standard retest of key support levels before heading higher. Uh, anyways, but we'll take things one step at a time. Uh, again, just to quickly recap today, DOJ uh DOJ stuff with the Fed that's going to be dominating the headlines. Given that the crypto market rallied in response to this, I suspect that it will rally even more once US markets open. I could be wrong, but you know, if after the news came out, crypto rallied, there's probably a lots of investors like institutions waiting for the US markets to open to basically continue or or rather to um amplify those views if that makes any sense. Same idea here tomorrow. CPI should come in lower than expected. That'll probably be a nice bullish tailwind for the markets uh overall. And then on Wednesday, Supreme Court likely to strike down the tariffs. That's probably going to result in a drop in the US dollar which will or further drop in the US dollar I should say which which is further support the crypto market and then we have the clarity act coming on Thursday with the SEC innovation exemption coming sometime by the end of this month potentially this week. So a lot to look forward to. It is going to be a very crazy week for crypto. And uh again just keep those CME gaps in the back of your mind. If something goes horribly wrong then those would be the levels to watch to the downside. 88,100 for Bitcoin. I think around 3,000 for Ethereum and then like 1,000 I think 200 uh 120 or something for uh for Salana on the CME gaps off the top of my head. Uh anyways guys, if you are trading crypto then do check out the links in the description, especially this first link here, BitGet up to 50,000 USDT deposit bonus.

When you click on that link, it'll take you to a page that looks like this. You'll notice that the Coin Bureau does have a partnership with BitGet. But on a personal note, I do use BitGet. I think it's an awesome exchange. That does not mean that you should be keeping your crypto on BitGet or any other exchange. Always keep your crypto on your personal wallet. Uh with that being said, BitGet doesn't just have futures trading, they also have spot trading, which is really awesome. Uh they have onchain trading, they have tokenized stocks, they have AI trading bots, a whole bunch of different features, and it's completely free to sign up. So just make an account, see if you like it. Trade around a little bit, and with some luck, you'll have enough trading volume to get these deposit bonuses, which again go as high as 50,000 USDT.
