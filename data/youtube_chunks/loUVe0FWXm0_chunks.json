      "text": "I know you're bullish longterm. Are you bullish in 2026? Bitcoin price prediction. >> Yeah, I was going to say I think Bitcoin will get to 250,000 in 2026 cuz the institutional demand is still there. We just got to find a way to get Bitcoin value into the altcoin space and it's likely going to be some sort of a non-custodial credit play. So, the bridge infrastructure is almost there because a tap routt we have a path to get Bitcoin to touch other things. We call that Bitcoin DeFi. SW's betting heavy on it. We're betting heavy on it for Cardano. We have a lot of people working on it, but it's not good enough. You also need a credit protocol and yield protocols. So on the credit side, you need a non-custodial way to lend your Bitcoin for stable coin and then you deploy your stable coin, get a yield and defy. And ideally, the whole circuit should be greater than the cost. So you get a passive yield with relatively predictable returns uh even though you're paying a credit fee for getting those stable coins. So those non-custodial lending protocols, they're under construction right now. There's a lot of people working on it. They can't do custodial because a lot of Bitcoin's held by institutions. They can't lose custody of the of the underlying asset. And a lot of Bitcoiners don't feel comfortable handing their Bitcoin to other people. So, if we can find a path for Bitcoin to work its way in a non-custodial way into the DeFi space and generate yield, then those trillions of dollars of value is going to leak into altcoins and pump them up. So, uh, that might be the mechanism that we actually get some real world adoption and, uh, in some some better markets in the altcoin space as a result of the Bitcoin appreciation. But to be frank, we're going to have to decouple the two at some point. And I think this is the closest in the history of the industry where decoupling is possible where it's no longer the case that when Bitcoin goes up, crypto goes up. And when Bitcoin goes down, crypto goes down. They can operate independently of each other. Um, and it just completely depends on where the user acquisition is going to come from. So, are we getting users from new sources like privacy and off-chain is coming in. We have several products we're launching, one of which next year is built for bare markets and it's all the revenues offchain that comes onchain. So, we're really excited about that. We have some other products that are fast follows behind it that we think fit those market dynamics, but it's it's going to be an interesting question to see. But but I believe Bitcoin will reach an all-time high. And I also believe there's going to be some value leakage from Bitcoin in the altcoin space. Is it going to be proportionate like 2021 where, you know, is $68,000 Bitcoin translated to $3 ADA translated to, you know, alltime high for Ethereum? Hard to say. You know, it's too early in the cycle and the macro is still too uncertain about a lot of things. Like we don't know if clarity is going to pass or if we're going to lose our window. We have to wait till after the next president comes in in 2029 because the Democrats are going to do Um, and uh, we also don't know if we're in an AI bubble or not. The biggest problem we have right now is Nvidia is worth more than Australia and Canada combined. And when you look at something like that, you're like, that's kind of like the Emperor's Palace in the 1980s being worth more than California. You know, it really feels bubbly. And if that bubble ps, it's about 1% of the entire US GDP. So that can create a catastrophic recession. And unfortunately, there's a correlation between tech stocks and crypto. So that could drag all of crypto down if uh if that bubble pops. >> A 250k Bitcoin price and quality altcoins pumping. You are speaking my language, Charles. Um but 250K is that too bullish? I just if if you were to simply distill what gets us to 250K, what are those demand factors? >> Well, it's the same that got us to 120. Yeah, you have a you have a situation where supply is relatively constrained and you have institutional purchasing. So you naturally have a push up, you know, from that and just by Fortune 500 and others taking uh nation states taking Bitcoin positions and they say, \"Hey, just throw a little bit of money.\""

Yeah, you have a you have a situation where supply is relatively constrained and you have institutional purchasing. So you naturally have a push up, you know, from that and just by Fortune 500 and others taking uh nation states taking Bitcoin positions and they say, \"Hey, just throw a little bit of money.\" You know, the other thing is that uh Morgan Stanley just announced to its private wealth advisors, there's 17,000 of them, that they can start advising people to take crypto positions. And so you have all these structured financial products that are coming out that are built in a way to enable retail investors to come in through traditional investment mediums. So they're not going to say go buy Foocoin or Bobcoin or Jimcoin. They're going to say buy Bitcoin as a starting point. It's a safe entry point in the market and the financial adviser feels like they're doing a good job there. So when Morgan Stanley says they can advise between 1 to 5% for 17,000 private wealth adviserss, the other guys are going to do the same thing. So you have a lot more buy demand coming from the 401k side, from the institutional side, and from the governmental side as treasury management relative to fixed supply. So you have to push up the price and if you do some models with it uh 250 feels pretty good within 12 months of that demand factor you now you're going to have es and flows like the infinite money glitch of DATs has been kind of closed and and so micro strategy is going to be having some issues and so that could create a localized collapse. I I had it described to me by a financial analyst once throwing a large rock in the pond. obviously doesn't kill the pond but the ripples get to the shore and there's a little bit of turbulence and so if micro strategy collapses or has an issue well that's going to cascade and create a local disruption in the market but if they can hold on and you know keep going then there's nothing to stop gradual appreciation from the inflow there uh and then the hope is with Bitcoin DeFi we can leverage a way to move that into the altcoin space and create some TVL uh from it but that's just a Bitcoinoriented world but bifurcation there's other user adoption use cases that are come independent of it because of stable coins. That's the other thing we haven't priced into the markets. You know, with the Genius Act, now everybody feels comfortable doing stable coins. That vertical is going to grow over the next 5 years from 250 billion to about a trillion dollars. That's the estimate that everybody's saying. Well, it's hard to have a trillion dollars in stable coins and not have that start playing in DGEN land, you know, and it's because it's native rail. So even if only 10% does hundred billion dollars does wonders for your TVL and for you know all these small cap cryptocurrencies and it flows really quickly and it's getting easier and easier to share liquidity and move liquidity out like you see with um midnight you know we have this $ 1.5 billion trading there's seamless between the dexes and the sexes and everything is just moving really swimmingly for that and it's just natural to see that that was unprecedented when we launched Cardano back in 2017 to have volume like this you just never see it you never see these types of arbitrage strategies exist, but it's just uh pretty straightforward. And you can even see with the per and how people are layering things with the glacier drop. Um that's a very different trading pattern that would be much more reminiscent of a traditional Wall Street pattern than it was in the historic web 3 days. So I feel really good, you know, about those prospects and whole economies are retuning to stable coins. Like Argentina, there's a hundred billion dollars in stable coins now relative to a $700 billion economy."

So I feel really good, you know, about those prospects and whole economies are retuning to stable coins. Like Argentina, there's a hundred billion dollars in stable coins now relative to a $700 billion economy. So one out of every seven dollars in that economy is in stable coins and that's going to grow to about 300 billion to 500 billion over the next 10 years. So they basically dollarized the economy. They've gotten off the peso and they're moving into stable coins and they're doing all the remittances and credits and business transactions and things like that with this. Well, that's going to end up in the crypto space. So that's independent of Bitcoin. It used to be Bitcoin was the gateway drug and we'd come in through that. Now stable coins are the gateway drug and they're coming in through stable coins to the crypto space. And hopefully that's a large enough of a wave to push the markets back to all-time highs. As good as Ethereum can be and Salana can be and Cardono can be, let's be intellectually honest about this, governments are talking about a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and Bitcoin alone. It's their entry point. And perhaps in five or 10 and 15 years, that dialogue narrative will change. But it is my belief that Bitcoin is going to go to quarter million to half million dollars within the next 12 to 24 months because of the investment inflows and the great interest that has been achieved. This will translate to an ecosystem whose value is starting to approach that of gold, an asset humans have used as a store of value for over 5,000 years. Simply put, Bitcoin is the store of value for the internet and it will remain in that role for the foreseeable future now that it has a DeFi"
