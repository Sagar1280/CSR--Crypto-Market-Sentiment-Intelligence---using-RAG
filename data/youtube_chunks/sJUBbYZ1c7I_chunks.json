      "text": "Yesterday, Dan posted a really exciting video that I want to follow up on. He's talking about the pullback almost being over, which I agree with 100%. But he was focusing on a specific narrative that he believes is going to be rallying next. If you didn't watch that video yet, you're going to watch it after this one for sure. But I want to follow up with the coins that he talks about in today's video here on Coinb Trading. What's up? My name is Aaron Dishner from the better traders. You're watching Coinb Trading. Let's get right into it and jump on over to Trading View. Now, the first thing we need to talk about, I'm giving a little bit away. First thing need to talk about is BTC. Bitcoin always drives the bus. And for all coins, it's always the short bus, as we all know. Um, we did hit a local top. We saw a reversal or a pivot high at around $94,000. And yesterday on Thursday, we saw a steeper drop down here to $89,000. Before we even talk about which coins are going to rally and all this fun stuff, we have to also recognize that this drop lower doesn't feel good. It closed a lot of things. It's a good sign in a way, but we don't want to see any more for the downside continuation. That's the first thing because if Bitcoin continues to drop, it will negatively affect Ethereum, which is one of the leading tokens that he talked about in the video yesterday. Now, the good news about Ethereum versus Bitcoin is actually there are actually four really good reasons or good differences between the two. For one, Bitcoin has had a great start to the year. RSI shot up a lot. It was was respected at resistance. It's fallen down back to this middle level. Volume has been good, but it's still bearish. Onbalance volume is okay. But the difference is that between Bitcoin and Ethereum, it actually looks a lot better on Ethereum's side. Yes, we also had a pullback yesterday, just like Bitcoin did. We're only marginally more green than BTC. But the main thing that's different aside from volume falling is that all balance volume looks significantly better for Ethereum. Not to mention price action looks much better for Ethereum. The other thing that's really interesting too about Ethereum is that it did not break above a local high. Bitcoin did marginally so on the 5th, but Ethereum hasn't. This is actually better to me because that means Ethereum has a greater chance of pushing up against resistance at around $3,300 right now as marked out by the TBO. The other thing that's really good too that he noted is that ETHBTC as a result will shoot up. This is Ethereum denominated in Bitcoin. The thing that you have to know about ETHBTC is that we've already been watching lots of bullish reversal signs forming all"

The other thing that's really good too that he noted is that ETHBTC as a result will shoot up. This is Ethereum denominated in Bitcoin. The thing that you have to know about ETHBTC is that we've already been watching lots of bullish reversal signs forming all all the way over here in November and December and finally we got that big bullish response except it came up 11% and it fell back down again. Okay, but just like Chumba Womba, you're not going to let it get you down. All right. So, the next thing you want to watch out for for ETH BTC is pushing above resistance, which today is at 0.03527. We'll say 0.05 353, whatever. But once Ethereum gets that next push up, when it starts to outperform Bitcoin, that's where alts are really going to fly. And I agree with Dan on a lot of his picks, but there's a couple I want to actually go a little bit deeper into in this video. But before I do, I want to draw your attention to the description down below. Check out all the exchange links that are there for you.

So, without further ado, let's talk about those other coins. Now I think it's clear that yes, Binancecoin, BNB, Salana, and actually Paul, which is previously Madic. Uh I think that this one is another one that has a lot of potential also in price action. But let's work backwards. Okay, that when we talked about BTC, we talked about Ethereum, we talked about ETH BTC, but another thing we need to talk about is stable coin dominance. Now, dominance levels is something I watch literally every single day. It can be a little bit exhausting, but here's the skinny on stable coin dominance."

Okay, that when we talked about BTC, we talked about Ethereum, we talked about ETH BTC, but another thing we need to talk about is stable coin dominance. Now, dominance levels is something I watch literally every single day. It can be a little bit exhausting, but here's the skinny on stable coin dominance. The only thing you need to know is that number go down, everyone happy. Number go up, everyone cry. That's all you need to know about stable coin dominance. And in regards to the trending breakout indicator, the TBO for short, whenever a price or in this case a percentage, whenever it falls inside of this mass, which is called the TBO cloud, this is a very very positive sign in our case, but this is called bearish consolidation. Okay, consolidation just means chop. Okay, that means a lot of this fun stuff that we're all very familiar with in crypto. Not even kidding. It's not even funny. But bearish consolidation means that we are consolidating going down lower and lower. This would be a very positive outcome for crypto. Just think when did the rally really start? It started on the first and lo and behold since the first we saw stable coin dominance not only drop 2% 4% it just kept going lower and lower. Why is that? Because when stable coin dominance that's combined with USDT and USDC falls, that means that dominance has to be shifting somewhere else and it was shifting in favor of Ethereum, Salana, XRP, others dominance. Okay, this is all good stuff. Now, the thing that everyone forgets when we have a good old-fashioned alt season rally of 6 days is that inevitably we're going to get some sort of pullback. And that pullback happened here um specifically on Wednesday this week. So as Dan was predicting, he was right. And this is also something I was really worried about because RSI, the relative strength index reading, and I use RSI with a length of seven. By the way, when it has an a massively oversold level, like 14.96 below 15, we should be expecting some sort of bearish pullback. We got the pullback. We saw an increase here in combined stable coin dominance. And the best thing of all, this is where the Christmas story starts to shine bright. Okay, I know it's way after Christmas, but you know what? If you're in Ethiopia, I believe you celebrate Christmas on the 1st. So, there you go. It's not too far apart. What? Just whatever. Okay, we're going to keep going. Um, whenever the price goes up and tags this green line right here, which is the TBO fast line, that's like"

If you're in Ethiopia, I believe you celebrate Christmas on the 1st. So, there you go. It's not too far apart. What? Just whatever. Okay, we're going to keep going. Um, whenever the price goes up and tags this green line right here, which is the TBO fast line, that's like a first touch, not a first down. No, we're not in football. Well, I guess people in America are in football. American football. We have to specify it. Why do I use these analogies? The thing I'm trying to say is that we got our pullback. Don't need those. We touched the fast line. Cool. Now, the next thing that I'm expecting, like Dan is expecting, is a fall lower for stable coin dominance. That is the most crippled line I've ever driven drawn in my life. That does not work so well. do this. Now when we see stable coin dominance fall lower, we know that the market is happy because when number go down, everyone smile. When number go up, everyone is crying, right? So right now everyone's crying because of two days of number go up. But now when number go down a lot lower, people will smile much bigger. Everyone will be a lot happier. The other thing that has to happen too is Bitcoin dominance has to fall. Don't worry, I'm going to get to these in a second. This is all leading up to it. The other thing that's really interesting about Bitcoin dominance is that it has this support level. Now, it is a little bit difficult to chart dominance levels because they're percentages, but you'd be surprised at how many times it works so well. So, we have an ascending level of support here. The price breaks below support on the second, dropping 75%. It falls down to it. Guess what? Shoots up. Now, we didn't get an exact tag of it, but this is what a rejection looks like. Seeing the price, or in this case, it's actually a percentage going up to test previously lost support, confirming it as resistance. Guess what? Number go down and Bitcoin dominance falling is always a good sign. What happened to make this rally really, really nice? Well, on the first, Bitcoin dominance fell and on the second it fell a lot more and it kept falling all the way here until Tuesday. Only on Wednesday and Thursday did it start to go up. So, if we see Bitcoin dominance going lower, which should happen, and stable coin dominance go back lower, which should happen. Guess what? Number go up, number go up, number go up, number go up. You get it? Now, why"

So, if we see Bitcoin dominance going lower, which should happen, and stable coin dominance go back lower, which should happen. Guess what? Number go up, number go up, number go up, number go up. You get it? Now, why is Salana dominance here? There are multiple other dominance charts like Ethereum dominance, there's XRP dominance, there's even Bitcoin Cash dominance if I'm not mistaken. But the reason why I'm focusing on Salon is because according to the top market cap, it is number five and we're excluding all stable coins. Okay, so what's really interesting right now in terms of dominance is that Salana dominance moving up this much and having bullish reversal signs from the TBO right here, which is great. And it's pushing up higher today. It's up 1%. yesterday up 2.1%. It's showing demand. Again, the dominance pie is the blob from the 1950s horror movie. It's the blob and it's going to absorb stuff or stuff's going to be taken away from it, but the blob always remains the same mass. Okay? So, that percentage that's being lost in stable coins and in Bitcoin is going to be moving somewhere, which is to Salana, which means that the price of Salana is going up. Now, in regards to his claims in the video, Dan was talking about these altcoins are going to rally next. Let's take a deeper dive and understand what's really happening and what the potential is for some of these charts. First, let's start with Ethereum. Okay, so I laid the case of why I agree with them, what I think is going to be happening next. We need to talk about this chart. We're not even going to use the TBO for a minute. Okay, we're just going to use support and resistance. There is clear overhead resistance from the high on 23rd of August. And we have a lower high. Okay, we saw a pierce, a push, and it got rejected. So, we're not moving it up higher. There's still valid resistance here at And if we were to pump immediately today, which not going to happen, but at $3,800, but we'll just leave it there just for giggles. We also have an ascending support line as well. This is a wedge. Okay, the wedge is going to have a very violent breakout in either direction. I personally think that everything is going to be going a lot lower this year because I believe that everything is going a lot lower cuz it's a bottom year. But let's just save that for later. Another important level to watch is this"

I personally think that everything is going to be going a lot lower this year because I believe that everything is going a lot lower cuz it's a bottom year. But let's just save that for later. Another important level to watch is this one. We saw the price on October 10th here on Binance, which has the most trading volume for the ETHUSDT trading pair, which is the trading pair for Ethereum has the most trading volume. That's why I chart it. Okay, we have a low here at 3435. It bounced back. It broke below it. We can see it's struggling to push above here on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th of November. Goes above, struggles again, false. Okay. When we got our little victory bounce here on the 10th of December, where did the price of Ethereum stop? Just shy of 3435. So, I believe that 3435 is a really, really important level to watch in terms of resistance. So, this number of 38, sorry, yeah, $3,81 gets dramatically dropped down to 34 35 or so, somewhere around there. Okay, that's actually in our favor. And you know why? Because that move is not such a bad move. It's like a 10% move from the current price. And a 10% move for Ethereum would be amazing for alts. Multiply that by two, even three. Okay. The other thing to consider as well in regards to the TBO indicator, which now I'm going to be bringing back, is on the weekly time frame, every time that we enter a bare market or we get massively oversold, usually we see the price get very extended or overextended from this thick green line, which is the fast line. And on the weekly, it's going to take a lot of price action to pull the price back, but the price will touch the fast line cuz it's a moving average. So, we got really overbought for a long time and we had to come back to life, back to reality. Great song. And then now we're really oversold and the price shoots back up. Doesn't quite touch the fast line. This is still a short-term target. Note the price 3357. I mean, it's not that far away from this price as well. So, that's why I'm really leaning towards this as a target. 3435, which is like a 10% increase for Ethereum. So, what does that mean for everything else? Well, the next one in line is Binancecoin. Binancecoin has been struggling with a lot of consolidation recently. It did break above overhead resistance from this high at 1375. It finally was able to break"

So, what does that mean for everything else? Well, the next one in line is Binancecoin. Binancecoin has been struggling with a lot of consolidation recently. It did break above overhead resistance from this high at 1375. It finally was able to break above it here, but it hasn't really pushed up to the next and final boss target, which in my opinion is going to be $1,000 or the 1.272 fib level at 992. That price increase, by the way, is about 10%. Lines up pretty well with Ethereum, don't you think? Why is this an important level? Well, these Fibonacci levels are taken from the 2021 high to the 2022 low. It's just a midcycle high, but these levels have worked really well. And not only did the price exceed it, but $1,000 is also a very magical number. And uh that's just a lot of zeros. And usually the market obeys or respects lots and lots of zeros. Okay, so let's go back over here. Um the next target or next chart to watch is Salana. Again, for the same reasons that I just shared about dominance increasing, I think Salana has good upside potential, but this is one that got rejected a lot harder than I thought it would. So the first thing we do is we draw out our resistance line from this high on the 18th of September to this high on the 6th of October. and then the market dropped. Now the good news about just market mechanics, okay, when the price is above the cloud, it's in strong bullish mode. When it goes inside, that's bearish consolidation. When it goes below, it's being strong bearish mode. So, we've seen one cycle of strong bullish, bearish consolidation, strong bearish. But now we're back inside of the cloud. Okay, this is the start of a new up like an up upward rally. I'm just Okay, now up to resistance today. That move is much greater than 10%. I think that Salana has a good chance of going up a lot higher. I don't think it's going to go up 20%. But maybe somewhere up to like 160 or so. The main thing uh Oh, sorry. I'm going to hold on to that. Just pin it real quick. Okay, if we go to the weekly time frame, there's also the weekly fast line, which hasn't been touched uh since October the 27th. That would only be a small increase of 12%. So, again, everything is oversold. We're starting to see the signs of a bounce that's incoming. Okay, last one I want to show you is Pole, which"

So, again, everything is oversold. We're starting to see the signs of a bounce that's incoming. Okay, last one I want to show you is Pole, which is previously Madic. This has had an incredible 2026 so far and it's just been making these really small but gentle moves. 6% 13% just going slowly slowly slowly. It's up 42% since the start of the year. It's a great move for this chart. Now, the reason why I think that this one has some good potential is also because volume is turning around for this, which means that onbalance volume showing cumulative volume. And because we've had consistent day overday green, green, green, green, green, green, green, green, green. Yes, 8 days and now a ninth day. We're seeing onbalance volume move up a lot higher. RSI is getting into some worry zones of 90, which means that we might see a a little bit of a pullback. But if we go over here to the weekly, we know that Paul and so many other coins on the weekly have been massively overextended from the fast line. From the current price of the fast line is an increase of 16%. Note that there's strong resistance here at 1518 by the way too. So again, I think that Dan's hunch that we're going to see some altcoins in the RWA sector rally next. I sure I agree with him. Now the one thing that we do have to keep in mind is Bitcoin and this is the last caveat. I do still believe that Bitcoin is in the middle of printing a bull trap. The target that I have is the fast line which is currently at 98379. So from the current price that's uh only a move of 7 or 8%. But we know due to the multiple factor effect that I shared now two years ago on the channel, if Bitcoin moves up 8%, Ethereum moving up 10%, that works out perfectly. Salana moving up 15%. Yep. That's totally doable. Pepe and all these other coins moving up 20 30%. Yep. Because the multiple factor effect tells us that whatever Bitcoin does, everything else is going to overreact it by a multiple of 1.2 times to 1.5, even two times greater than whatever Bitcoin does. and especially the lower down you go on the market cap food chain, you're going to see those charts pump way higher and harder. So, do I believe and agree with Dan that we're going to see an alt rally? Yes. But"

So, do I believe and agree with Dan that we're going to see an alt rally? Yes. But what I want to encourage you to do is to focus on charts that already have good momentum, good potential. They have good bones, as we like to say in the training grounds. I don't know where I come up with this stuff. I'm not a coach or a trainer, but whatever. The main thing you need to know is that, and of course the voice cracks at the very end, that I do think that we're going to see a rally. I do think it's going to happen, but we got to watch BTC because the next move up higher could be the last one where we cap out our bull trap and then we go lower. Don't believe me? Watch this video next. Until the next time, you know what to do. Stay awesome and stay in the green. Peace."
