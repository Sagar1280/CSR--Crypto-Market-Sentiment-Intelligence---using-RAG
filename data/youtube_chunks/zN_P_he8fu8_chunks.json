      "text": "We are seeing reports that in the last 12 hours over $100 billion has been wiped out from the crypto futures market. But the technical signs were on the charts. If you watched my last video, you could have caught this move with us. What's up guys? I'm Jordan Crypt and this is a quick update on the Bitcoin price action charts. If you're new to the channel, subscribe and let's get into it. If you are a trader, make sure you're taking advantage of our week's deposit bonus campaign using this QR code. So, what we are seeing again is a mix of technical indications and fundamental catalysts pushing us in the same direction. Trump has announced new tariffs, but we were also already positioned short because of very clear signs we were seeing on the charts. In my last video right here only four days ago, I gave the warning for the potential market cipher divergence on the wave trend which is our momentum. An extremely powerful indication. We will print the bearish divergence on this wave trend because we are at a [snorts] higher high on price and that would be a lower high on momentum and this could be the sign of a very strong short trade. All right, so there we go. Clear as day. I did give the warning for the potential printing of this bearish divergence and it has played out very nicely. I hope you were all positioned. Make sure you have watched the market cipher trigger wave and divergence tutorials on this channel so that you can get these beautiful moves in future. If you have missed it, do not hop on a moving train. On Friday night, I saw this red dot trigger wave printing. That was already the first sign for me that I can go ahead and open a short trade because we did see the VWAP cross on our market cipher. And we were seeing our money flow pointing down along with our trigger wave red dot. These are our three levels of confluence that we need for a nice short push. Then we also saw our second market cipher strategy come into play, which is the divergence strategy clearly printing for us. Again, for those of you who don't know what a divergence is, in this sense, it is simply our momentum showing a lower high with a downward sloping angle and our price clearly showing a higher high with an upward sloping angle. This means that the charts are overpumped. Momentum is dying and there should be a nice short push. After the printing of these two signals, we have seen a really nice 4% plus down on spot. Again, this is a really strong reminder to make sure that you are watching the tutorials and learning this indicator and its strategies because it is absolutely brilliant. What you can do is actually go to the market cipher. Make sure you have it set up like I have given in my market cipher setup tutorial on this channel and you can go in and add the alert for the bearish divergence on the daily time frame to make sure that you are not missing these very very strong signals in future. These two strategies were of course our very strong sell signals, but there were a lot of other indications on the chart that we should have been positioning ourselves short. We were very high up in the value area high of the current range. We were talking about a long squeeze after the short squeeze. We were also at our parallel channel resistance of the potential bare flag pattern. And I'm quickly going to go through each of these in a little bit of detail. So, first of all, many of you know one of my favorite indicators is the fixed range volume profile. Please check out that tutorial on my personal trading channel. The link is in the description of this video. And if we drop it into the current range, we can clearly see that we were very heavily up into value area high of the range. And we were sitting just on our very big high volume node within that value area high. I did mention this is not a place to ever be going long because if you do go long, you are fomoing in and you're setting yourself up to be long squeezed. It is rather a place to be looking for the signs to go short. And we did get those signs on our market cipher. This is just a classic rinse and repeat of price dumping from value area high levels."

It is rather a place to be looking for the signs to go short. And we did get those signs on our market cipher. This is just a classic rinse and repeat of price dumping from value area high levels. And we did see price now front running the PC, which means we very well could still come down in price to properly sweep the liquidity at the PC. That will be our deciding factor whether the PC gives us a bounce back up into value area high or whether we lose the PC back down all the way to our value area low of the range which will be one of the final take profits for this short trade and also a place we can start scouting for the rinse and repeat into our longs. Another thing to be very aware of here that becomes more clear as you're on the charts for more and more time, very often after a nice green push upward, the whales will put in what we call a long squeeze, which is to squeeze out those that are fomoing into the long trades. Here we can see the impulse move and the break of structure from the downtrend. And then we see a follow through green candle of FOMO traders. A lot of leverage long trades coming into the market which were very quickly squeezed out. And we have the same thing here. A very strong impulse green move with lots of traders FOMOing into long trades at the wrong level. Then we have the whales squeezing them out. So be aware of this in future and always try to get into your long trades at the right place which is your support and not your resistance. We also spoke about this channel which is still in play for the potential bare flag pattern. There were signs showing us that this upward sloping resistance was in play. This was another reason to be looking for shorts given the very clear tweezer pattern we did see at that level. Now we can also see the upward sloping support level that we might see some very nice support at if we come down. Then of course remember we've spoken about it many times. Our potential bare flag pattern is still in play with a very bearish price target all the way down to around $75,000. The support levels to watch for if this is going to play out are the high volume nodes below the PC such as 90,000 and $87,600 as well as a proper break of this parallel channel and a retest with volume to the downside. If this happens, we will then see if our value area low is able to hold us up. There could be a lot of fear coming into the market at this time, which could cause some capitulation down to our 75k level. Also, one reason we may see these lower levels is this very big wick bottom sitting around 80,000, which has not been properly swept with candle closes as of yet. Another nice technical analysis strategy here is to zoom out onto the larger range and pop in your fixed range volume profile to pull up your high volume nodes of the larger range below us within the value area low of our micro range as well as these levels below us towards our bare flag target. And we can see there is a high volume node sitting right here at 76,000. Things could even get more bearish with our largest high volume node in the value area low of the larger range sitting at $67,000. When scoping for the next long here, I think a nice tool to use is your Fibonacci. And this is a nice clear trend. If we do break this upward sloping market structure and start to come down further, we can look for the golden pocket range of this Fibonacci retracement which as we can see is sitting very nicely between these two high volume nodes of 87,000 and 90,000."

This might very well be a nice reversal point for a long trade. But be careful because if we lose this golden pocket, we could easily come back down into the value area low. Currently it is the 0.382 level that has given us support and the 0.5 level is sitting around our PC which is the highest volume currently traded within this micro range. This golden pocket zone would be the next zone that I would look for a long but let me be very clear that I would need a market cipher green dot trigger wave or bullish divergence before I would go in on this long trade. So watch price if it does come into the zone and make sure you're waiting for the right confluence before you pull the trigger. If we lose that zone, the next zone I would look for is this entire value area low zone or a very nice bullish confirmation signal. Another strategy to use here is the sniper strategy of rhyming your regular RSI and your stochastic RSI. I have posted a full tutorial of this strategy on this channel. So, please do watch it so that you're up to date with all of the confluence that we're using. The strategy did play out really nicely for the short because we just tipped the overbought level on the regular RSI and rhymed it with our stoastic in overbought and that really gave us such a nice early warning trigger for the short trade or a really juicy long trade. We would now need to wait for these to both reset and give us a rhyme in the oversold area like we saw here for our last beautiful, beautiful long trade for this strategy."
