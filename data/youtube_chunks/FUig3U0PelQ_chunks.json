      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the heavy metal verse. Today we're going to talk about the silver mania phase that we currently find ourselves in. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and check out the website at benjamancow.com. Link is in the description below. Let's go ahead and jump in. We have been following this silver move for years and I think it is safe to say that we are currently in a fullblown silver mania phase. This is more or less in line with some of the things we've discussed. We've talked a lot about the metals having sort of this blowoff top more than likely within the first half of 2026. there would then likely be a a pullback, a larger pullback, consolidation phase for a while. Could be 6 months, could be 18 months, and then I think they'll go higher after that. But right now, silver is in a mania phase right now. Now, we've talked about this for a while. I want to talk about some of the different metrics that you might actually find somewhat interesting. We first discussed this many, many years ago. Um, if you actually look at at some of the charts or some of the videos that we did back in, you know, I guess like 2022, 2023 time frame, you know, silver was at like $25. Okay? And and so now it sort of has followed along. It's hit these new all-time highs. It had the pullback after sweeping the prior all-time high, and now it has gone into fullblown mania mode. Now, what's interesting is that just a couple of weeks ago, we made a video on silver talking about how it was starting to heat up, but that we would likely see it continue to extend and that one of the biggest mistakes that traders often make is they sell their winners to go buy the losers, right? So, they'll they'll find a trade that's doing really really well and they'll go sell it to go buy something that just isn't doing anything. Now, a lot of people make these mistakes because it's it's somewhat unintuitive. It's it's natural for people to think, \"Oh, I want to sell the thing that's doing well and then go buy the thing that's not because the thing that's not is going to start doing well.\" But momentum carries a lot of weight. Something that is moving up is more likely to continue moving up than something that is not. But we are really getting into that to the mania phase of this silver move that we've been discussing uh for the last several years. So we want to do some of the same things we did in the last video and compare the current phase to where we were in prior parabolic rallies by silver just to get an idea of of where we"

So we want to do some of the same things we did in the last video and compare the current phase to where we were in prior parabolic rallies by silver just to get an idea of of where we are with respect to prior mania phases if that makes sense. I also want to spend some time talking to you guys about the the ratio of gold to silver. I think that'll also be useful in trying to better navigate this market. So, the first thing to look at here is we can see that silver swept the all-time high, got a pullback, and now has entered fullblown mania. Now, for some people, it might not seem like a mania phase. If if you're used to buying like altcoins and you remember the the alts the alt seasons that we had in prior cycles where altcoins were going up 100% a day or something. But remember with things like metals, they they move slower, but when you start seeing like 5% move day in and day out, that is a mania phase for metals, right? It really is. And what I want to do is compare what is happening now with some of the prior parabolic rallies that we've seen in the past and and talk about kind of like where I think we are within the current overall market cycle of of silver. So the first thing is that I am under the impression like I'm under the impression that we will have a blowoff top more than likely in the first half of this of this year. And I've I've been saying that for for quite a long time. Some type of a blowoff top that we didn't recover from. What's interesting is that, you know, and I've said this before, I've been under the impression that we're sort of in the first phase of the mania, right? We're in sort of this the first phase of it where you have your initial rally, a long consolidation, and then another rally, right? Your initial rally, a long consolidation, and another rally. What killed the first rally? What killed the first rally in both of these cases? were recessions. That's what killed them. But silver recovered from those recessions pretty quickly in the grand scheme of silver recoveries. They didn't take it wasn't one of those that took like 30 years to recover from. So I think that is what we are likely approaching. Now, if we look at the extension from say let's look at the short-term bubble risk. This is just looking at the extension from"

They didn't take it wasn't one of those that took like 30 years to recover from. So I think that is what we are likely approaching. Now, if we look at the extension from say let's look at the short-term bubble risk. This is just looking at the extension from the 20week moving average. If you look at where we currently are and you look at prior mania phases, you can see we are fairly extended, right? We are fairly extended. But with that said, we have also seen phases before where we were extended even more. And this is what makes it so difficult is knowing how long we can stay relatively elevated at these levels. Now, where it gets tricky and this is what this is sort of one of the things we went through in in in this video, right? In this video right here, this is one of the things we went went through. We talked about, you know, how hard it is trying to time these things and and why sometimes the best thing to do is just let it ride until proven otherwise. Silver was $78 in that video. Now it's 91, right? So, you can see how like at the time when silver was 78, people were saying that like that was the top, but now it's continued to go up. So, it's so hard to know. Now, if you look at a prior time in history when silver was this far extended above its 20we moving average, you could see that it was in September of 1979. Now, at the time, the price of silver was $17. Now, had you sold all your silver at that price, you would have had a pretty good return, right? You would have had a pretty good return even if you bought it at this high right here in 1974. and you sold it at that high right there in 1979, you would have still made 155% despite the fact that you you bought the top. Now, if you accumulate at the lows, you were actually looking at about a 360% move. Where it gets interesting though and why it's so hard is if you did sell there, which is the current kind of extension that we currently are at, silver still went up another 168% from there. Now, that's probably the most egregious mania phase that we've seen. Uh there's another one right here, sort of a more initial one that perhaps we should take a look at. And and you can see that when silver was this extended back in 1974, the price was around $5 and then it ultimately rallied up to around"

And and you can see that when silver was this extended back in 1974, the price was around $5 and then it ultimately rallied up to around six almost $7. Now that might not sound like a lot, but you know that that's still another 20 25% move where I think we are. And we sort of, as I mentioned before, I think we're in the initial phase of a larger bull market, right? This is the initial phase. I think we're heading into a blowoff top that should finalize in the first half of this year. Good chance even in the first quarter of this year. And then after that, it's going to lead into this like either long consolidation or a V-shaped recovery, right? It could be either one. I don't know. And it depends on how bad the the pullback in stocks is. But then out of that, I think we'll go higher into the end of the decade. So if you believe that, then of course you could always argue maybe it's just not even worth trying to time things. Just kind of hold through whatever whatever comes our way. I want to show you guys kind of the extent of the draw downs that we had. So in 1974, silver ended up dropping by about 40% or so. In 2008, silver ended up dropping by about 60%. What's incredible is that a 40% drop from the current prices doesn't even get you back to the prior all-time high. So, that's one of the things that's allowed me to kind of sit comfortably with this stuff and and not sort of panic um like panic sell because I I think it's over or something. It's kind of recognizing that, you know, if there is a drop, there usually is some type of a warning and and this is kind of the hard thing that you kind of have to figure out. Are you okay with this idea or not? And and this is how it goes, okay? Okay. And and and only a few people will will like this view, but I want to give you guys a potential view that might be helpful as you navigate markets over the long term. And that is to say, when you find yourselves in a parabolic rally, historically, the best thing to do is just to kind of ride it out and then to start skimming profits as you get higher and higher, right? You start off slow. you maybe sell like a small percent"

You start off slow. you maybe sell like a small percent and then you continue to go up. Now, I want to give you guys another another idea. The other thing that you can do when you're in a mania phase is not do anything and then just wait for a large drop and then you sell the counter trend rally back up. So, you basically you miss the high. You kind of tell yourself, hey, I'm going to miss the high no matter what. Like, no one's going to be able to time that. I'm just going to wait for there to be this like knee-jerk 20 30 40% drop. I'm not going to panic sell. I'm gonna wait for the counter trend rally back up and I'm gonna sell there. So, had you done that in 1974, you probably wouldn't have sold near $7. You would have sold closer to like 5.5 to six. In 1980, you would not have sold at 47, but you might have sold at 21. Now, that's a big difference, right? Obviously, it would have been nicer to sell at 47 or on the way up than selling everything right here. But if you bought silver at $3, selling at 21 is still a pretty great return. What I typically do when we start getting into the mania phases is to start slowly scaling out, right? That way you at least capture some of the gains. Now, I haven't sold anything yet to be completely honest. like I haven't I have ridden this move for years now, for years. But I want to show you guys something that might make it a little bit easier. Okay? I And this I I I think this will help in navigating kind of the stressful time that this is because when when it's euphoria, it's great, right? But it's also kind of stressful because you don't you know, you you you love it, but you're constantly worried. is it going to end? I want to show you guys an example of something. But first, we're going to look at it through the lens of gold. Okay? So, if you like silver, you probably also like gold. Uh, and if you don't, then then I think you can still appreciate like what we're going to talk about here. Okay? So, when you look at gold, gold also has some significant pullbacks, but typically the pullbacks by gold are"

Uh, and if you don't, then then I think you can still appreciate like what we're going to talk about here. Okay? So, when you look at gold, gold also has some significant pullbacks, but typically the pullbacks by gold are not as bad, right? So if you look at the pullback in 1974, in March 1974, silver had a 42% pullback. If you go to to um to April of 1974 or sorry, no, this is this is July of 1973. This is April of 1974. Gold had a 26% pullback. You see that? So, silver had a larger pullback starting in February, March of 1974. Gold had a smaller pullback. Gold then put in a new all-time high, whereas silver put in a lower high. But going up, silver had the better move, right? like going up. I I think as measured from November of 1971, silver rallied 423%. As measured from um what was it? November of 1971. Gold rallied 366%. So, silver had the more explosive move just like it is now. When the pullback happened, silver topped first, right? So, silver topped. Gold also got a correction, but then gold went to another all-time high. But that's not what I want to show you because we're going to get to that in a second and and how gold can be helpful in in an environment like this. What I really want to show you is the S&P 500 divided by gold. This is the chart that I think everyone should be watching. Whether you're in metals, whether you're in stocks, whether you're in crypto, whether you're in Bond, whatever you're in, this is the one of the more important charts right now. There have been two times over the last several decades that the stock market broke down from this level against gold. Two times in history besides now. One in 2008 and the other time in 1973. What happened in both cases is the stock market sold off. So when this broke down, the stock market sold off. You can pretty clearly see it, right? Stock sold off and then silver and then the stock market collapsed against gold. Why did the stock market collapse against gold? Did it collapse against gold because stocks were dropping quicker than gold? Did it collapse against gold because stocks were going up less than gold? Neither of those are true. The ratio collapsed because stocks were dropping and at the same time gold was going up. So if you look at this reddish orange line when the breakdown occurred, gold continued higher in 1973. It also continued higher"

The ratio collapsed because stocks were dropping and at the same time gold was going up. So if you look at this reddish orange line when the breakdown occurred, gold continued higher in 1973. It also continued higher in 2008. You see both of those examples. So sometimes I'll put out some controversial tweets. There's sort of a saying that Twitter Ben is not the same as YouTube Ben. But I've told people for a while now, you know, that they should be that I think it makes sense to pivot away from altcoins and to other things. And they just keep saying no, it's too late and and and you know that their altcoins are going to do better. But what ends up happening is that metals continue to go up and altcoins continue to go down. Now, would it be a mistake to FOMO into silver right now? Probably, right? Probably because even if it goes up, you're probably not going to sell and you're going to get trapped. So, I'm not suggesting that you go do that, but there are other metals that that might be a little bit more attractive. When you look at a chart like this, you can pretty clearly see that when stocks break down against gold, right? When they break down against gold, the stock market dropped, but gold went up. Now, what did silver do? Like, what did silver do when when that happened? So, now we're going to overlay the price of silver onto the same chart. Let's go ahead and remove well, let's see if we can do it with gold in here. Um, I know that might be kind of difficult. Maybe we'll remove the S&P because we already know what happened there. So, and let's change this to a different color so it stands out a little bit more. We'll change it to yellow. So, this is silver. What did silver do when stocks broke down against gold? What did silver do? You can see this line right here. So in 1973, silver went up for about, you know, for a little bit longer, right? A little bit longer. It was in this parabolic rally and then it had the correction and then it went up again. In 2008 when this broke down, silver, if you look right here, silver topped out around that time and then it went down and then again it went higher. So, what I think is going, it's hard to know exactly when that pullback will happen, but my guess is that the way this is going to play out"

So, what I think is going, it's hard to know exactly when that pullback will happen, but my guess is that the way this is going to play out for silver is you're likely going to have a blowoff top within the first half of this year. You're likely going to then have a larger pullback, right? A larger pullback. Could be 40%, could be 60, could be 30. I would say probably somewhere between thick uh 30 to 50%. Maybe plus or minus 5 or 10% on either side, but you'll probably have something like that starting in the first half of this year. It's going to be scary, but I don't think it'll be the top. That's the hard part about this. I don't even think it'll be the top. I think it'll be a local top that holds for a while. You can see this one. We had a top in '08 and then the real top was in 2011. I think it's going to be something like that where you have like a top in 2026 and then maybe another one like in like 2029 or 2030 or something like that. One of the reasons I think that is because a lot of times these these bull markets last about 10 years. So, you could argue that silver had a bull market from 1971 until 1980, lasted about 10 years. You could also argue that the bull market started in 2001 and lasted until 2011, about 10 years. The one we're currently in started in 2020. And so I'm thinking, all right, it'll probably last the better part of a decade, but I cannot I I do not think we're just going to go straight up for the next 3 years, right? I think there will be a blowoff top in the first half of 2026 and then the pullback and then another rally going into the end of the decade. That's how I see this playing out. Now the hard part is what do you do now, right? What do you do now? Do you sell your silver in the mania phase? Do you just live through the correction? Do you um what if what if we have a mania phase and then that is the top, right? Like that's a scenario that you have to consider as well. Like there's no guarantee that you have another future rally. Um although I think it will happen, but there's no guarantee of that happening. What I think in this scenario that can provide some help"

Like there's no guarantee that you have another future rally. Um although I think it will happen, but there's no guarantee of that happening. What I think in this scenario that can provide some help is the gold silver ratio. Now this if you follow the channel is a similar idea to the ETH Bitcoin ratio that we talked about many many years ago. If you guys remember many years ago, I I said that I was selling my Ethereum, my Ether at 0.08 or 0075. I think I saw some point at 0075, some at like 0065 and then some at like 0085. So it averages out to be about 008 or something. Um, I sold my Ethereum to Bitcoin up here and then I bought it back down here. So what does that mean? I still had exposure to the asset class via Bitcoin, but I didn't have to watch my ETH bleed for several years. So, I still had exposure. I had the upside potential and I minimized the downside. Now, if we go back to silver, one of the things to think about is kind of like what we saw in 1974. Silver topped in March. Gold also topped in March, but it had another rally into the end of the year. You could argue that gold would likely hold up longer than silver. Now, if you look at the other rally, silver topped in January of 1980. Gold topped also in January of 1980. The difference is that the dead cat bounce by gold was only 15 to 20% down. The dead cat bounced by silver was almost 50% down. So there's a chart you should look at. It's the gold silver ratio, right? Actually, we're going to do it on this other one over here. Uh look at the gold silver ratio. And we're going to look at it in two ways. First way is this way where you kind of have higher highs and higher lows. And you can see that silver, this ratio has kind of hit that trend line a few times on the on the high end and on the low end. But there's also a couple of deviations. There was a deviation in 19 or in 2020. There was also a deviation in 2011. If you believe in this channel, you could argue that we're just in one of these deviations. And the current ratio is 50. Now to give you some idea, the ratio in May was 107. If you are a believer in mean reversion, it's probably only a matter of time"

Now to give you some idea, the ratio in May was 107. If you are a believer in mean reversion, it's probably only a matter of time before this ratio bounces back up to 80. It doesn't necessarily have to be on a massive silver correction, but there's it's probably only a m it probably would include that. It's only a matter of time. if you believe in this uptrend with a couple of deviations outside of it. So, what I'm saying is that if you're a silver bug and you want to just hold your silver, more power to you, right? Like, I'm not saying you have to go sell or anything like that. I mean, like, if you've been holding for years and this is your moment, the last thing you want to do is go sell your winners and go buy losers. Not saying that. If you're someone that has held silver for a few years and you know, you're like, \"Yeah, like this is great. I want to lock in some profits. Maybe let the the rest ride. Maybe you want to sell 10% of your stock, 20%, something like that, just to lock it in and know that, hey, you at least made something so you don't end up roundtpping everything. One idea is this chart because we know that whenever there is a blowoff top, gold will likely hold up better than silver. So, one potential idea I want to just throw out there for people that that might want to offload a little bit of their silver as we get into this as we're in this mania phase, whether it be at like $90 or 95 or 100 or whatever the price ends up being, dcaing out usually is the best way to go. But the thing about DCAing out is that like okay, well then what? Like now you're stuck holding fiat and then you know fiat is going asmtoically to zero. So what do you do? One idea is to if you are going to take profits, think about taking profits from silver to gold because in that scenario, gold still gives you exposure to the upside, but then it starts to minimize your downside risk, right? So like if there's a 30% correction in gold, there's going to be a 50% correction on silver, more than likely, right? If there's a 10% correction in gold, it'll be like a 20 to 30% correction in silver. Now, I'm not asking you to go sell your entire silver position."

I'm saying in a scenario if you find yourself if you find yourself in the scenario where you've been holding it and you just want to lock in some profits, whatever percentage that might be, you could go to cash. But one thing is you could just go to gold. And what's crazy is if you train your mind to think in terms of gold valuations rather than USD valuations, then there there exists a way that you could potentially double up your silver sack by sitting in gold for a little while, right? I want to give you an example. Imagine if you had traded your gold or your silver to gold at the top in 2011. Okay, you literally sold silver at the top, but you bought gold at the top. You got in at a ratio of 31. And imagine you were just patient and you didn't even think it was going to go back up here, but maybe you just thought it was going to go back up to the mean. It went up to 66. So what that means is you could have sold your silver for gold in 2011, bought it back in 2013 and essentially doubled your stack, right? Just doubled your stack. Still experiencing some of the downside with gold, but then you still doubled your silver stack by doing nothing other than sitting in gold. That's an idea. If you go with this idea, Phil, I mean, I'm not I I still think you don't want to completely sell your winners, right? Like it it's it can make sense to let the winners win until they stop winning and to just be like, \"Look, I'm not going to predict the top because just a few weeks ago, silver um silver had a you can't even see the correction anymore on this monthly chart, but I'm sure many of you guys remember it. Like just a few weeks ago, silver rallied to 83 and then it went down to 70 and everyone thought it was over. Or not everyone, but a lot of people thought it was over. And we were looking at this chart on the last video and I was like, \"Look guys, this is a high and then a lower high and then you have a higher low and a higher low. It looks like it's converging,"

I mean, it could have broken down, but we got lucky and and it went up. Momentum is a hell of a drug. It's what makes people seem like geniuses in a bull market. As long as you draw whatever pattern you want to, as long as the outcome, your conclusion from the TA that you draw as in then it goes up, you're more likely going to be right than wrong. And so it makes you seem like a genius for a far longer amount of time than if you keep trying to call the top. Now, I want to say why you might be like, well, why not just sell all your silver to gold? like why why hold any? Because this is a shorter term chart. This only goes back to the 1990s. If you look at a longer term chart, I want to show you something. I drew this out many, many years ago. I think I drew this out in that video from like three years ago. We can go check it in a second. You see this chart? Let me go see if I can find it. Um, it was in this video. Look at this. So, this is where we talked about it. This gold silver ratio heading back down. Where did I draw it out? I said I drew it going to 50, right? I mean, you can see I I drew it going to 50 in 2026. By the way, this video was recorded in like what, 2022, 2023, and we drew it going to 50 in 2026. It's now 2026. The gold silver ratio is 50. Okay. But when you look at this chart, you have to ask yourself, are we going to go back up here? What if what if we go back down here? Like what? Why can't we go back down here? Right? I That's one of the reasons to hold some no matter what, right? to just be like, look, I don't want to get rid of my entire silver position. What if it continues to outperform gold for, you know, for years after the current blowoff top? So, that's one thing I would consider. I mean, if you if you"

What if it continues to outperform gold for, you know, for years after the current blowoff top? So, that's one thing I would consider. I mean, if you if you also connect the dots on some of these like longer term moves, um, you know, it's hard to know exactly where that maybe that low is going to be. Could be 42, the answer to everything. tough call. I think for me like and if and if you've been following this channel for a while, the moves that you're currently seeing in metals are the justification for why we talked about them for so long and why we talked about them being good for for for diversification, good for hedging, because now we find ourselves in a scenario where people thought this was going to be happening in in altcoins, but in reality it's not. It's happening in metals. By the way, I've seen a lot of people that have been more so in the altcoin camp for a while and have sort of faded my ideas and and kind of called me out a lot and you know, and they what they do is they they sort of pretend that they've been making so much money in altcoins by cherrypicking a few that did well and ignoring the hundreds that they shilled that ultimately went to zero. All you need is this chart, the altcoin market against silver, total three divided by silver. And what you will see is that altcoins are at lower valuations today than they were in November of 2022, December of 2022. They're lower today than they were back then. Okay. Now, the harsh reality that I'm going to tell you is the same thing I told you with Bitcoin and altcoins. This was a Bitcoin bull market for the last few years. And because Bitcoin went up, it hid the underlying weakness in the altcoin market. Now, the move up by metals is hiding the underlying weakness in stocks and in crypto, right? like it's hiding it. When gold and silver get a correction, risk assets will likely drop more. Okay, this is what we've seen. You guys remember the correction that gold had in April? I don't either because it lasted for a day or two. It was barely a drop, but you remember the one in stocks? It was a 20% drop. metals have been more resilient. Okay, so when the correction by metals comes, which I think starts in the first half of this year, risk assets will likely drop more."

It was a 20% drop. metals have been more resilient. Okay, so when the correction by metals comes, which I think starts in the first half of this year, risk assets will likely drop more. This move by metals is hiding the underlying weakness in risk assets just like Bitcoin hid the underlying weakness in altcoins. You can see it by looking at the advanced decline index of the top 100 cryptocurrencies and see that it's been trending down since 2021. But total market cap of crypto went up. It went up because Bitcoin went up. Most everything else went down. And that's why the ADI, the top 100 went down. So now the stock market doesn't look weak on the USD valuation on the USD valuation. In fact, it's looked pretty strong for a long time. Where it's looking weak is its gold valuation. And as this becomes more obvious that it's breaking down, then you'll see the weakness likely show up on the USD valuation. So that is where I think we are right now in this broader market cycle. Um I I think that if this breaks down, you'll see a correction in stocks and you'll see a correction in crypto. I know everyone's getting excited about Bitcoin right now because it's rallying, but as I said before, this was this was an expected rally. Like we talked about, it's likely going to get this counter trend rally back up to its bull market support band and 50week moving average in early 2026. You know, this is something that we've talked about. And if you look at USDT dominance plus USDC dominance, this pattern is all too familiar where you get a breakout, you get a breakout, people panic, it drops back down. This is the rally crypto is currently in and then it bounces off the bull market square where penning goes higher. That means crypto will likely get a correction after this hits the bull market support band. So you could argue the move in metals is masking the weakness in stocks just like the move in Bitcoin over the last few years mask the weakness in altcoins. So, what I would say with something like metals, it does not make sense to go sell your metals and buy risk assets in my opinion. Not financial advice, but if you're going to go sell silver to go buy some random memecoin, that's probably a terrible idea in my opinion. If you are going to sell silver during the mania phase, you could either go to US dollars or you could"

Not financial advice, but if you're going to go sell silver to go buy some random memecoin, that's probably a terrible idea in my opinion. If you are going to sell silver during the mania phase, you could either go to US dollars or you could go to something like gold. Gold makes some sense because it'll probably hold up better than silver whenever there is a correction. I still think no matter what, there is still a reason to hold on to some silver as I have. I mean, I've held on to my entire position so far. That might change soon. Um, but one of the reasons is because there's no telling, you know, just how high things can go, right? Like no one really knows uh exactly. And so I have to be open-minded, you know, to to to what could potentially happen, right? I mean, if you look at like a bar pattern of some of these prior moves, um like imagine if that happened. Like imagine if we got a correction all the way back down to 58 and then it rallied up into the hundreds many years later. Like that could happen. Um it's really really hard to know if you just take this rally right here. If you say that like this is the rally that we're in um and we're not like if this is the big rally that then there's nothing after it then who's to say that it couldn't go all the way even higher right now. Listen, if silver goes to like 150 or something, I might have to reassess whether that there's going to be something after that or not because then it's almost like that would be a really incredible move in a really short period of time. So, I want you to keep an eye on that as well. My thought process now, don't sell your winners to buy your losers. If you are going to sell silver, I think going some to gold can make some sense just to give you some exposure. So, that's kind of how I think about this. I don't I'm not saying it makes sense to go sell and just sit in cash. Um, and also by the way, when silver when when stocks broke down against gold in the last two cycles back in like 1970s and in 2008, gold continued to rally. Silver topped one of those times right when it right when it broke down, but still the markets held up. The me the metals markets held up for a little while after that.

Hopefully, uh, you continue to make a lot of money in metals. I hope these videos, while have not been as frequent, I hope they have been useful to to some of you as you continue to navigate the heavy metal verse. If silver hits 100, we'll maybe come back and do another video. Um, but I've kind of explained my thoughts on on what I think silver's going to do. Blowoff top first half of this year consolidation phase. If the top ends up being 150 or something, I don't know if you get another rally after that. Maybe. Uh, but that's getting kind of high, right? like it's getting kind of high. We'll take it one step at a time.
