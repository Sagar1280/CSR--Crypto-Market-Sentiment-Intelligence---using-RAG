      "text": "December 19th, Bank of Japan. One quarter point. That's the difference between a quick trip. Just show them your Bitcoin and tell them everything's going to be okay. Rupy says just hold your Satoshi's and your Bitcoin and it's going to be okay. You guys let me know if you think Robert needs a haircut. I think he needs a haircut. Bank of Japan, one quarter point. That's the difference between a quick trip to 70,000 or a sprint back toward $100,000 Bitcoin. Everyone's watching crypto prices this week. The real story though is in Japan. For more than a decade, Japan has quietly underwritten global risk. Cheap yen funded leverage across stocks, bonds, and crypto. That carry trade became the backbone of global liquidity. And this week, that backbone comes under real pressure as the Bank of Japan meets on December 19th. Markets are almost certain Japan will move this week. Roughly nine out of 10 economists expect a quarter point hike to 3/4 of a percent. Probabilities are even higher on prediction markets, marking another step away from negative rates. That hike is the base case. When it lands, leverage unwinds fast and risk assets feel it everywhere. A pause would be the real surprise. And that liquidity shock wave would send liquidity rushing back into risk assets. When that in anchor moves, you feel it in your portfolio, your mortgage rates, even the price of basic goods. That's how global this has become. Today we're breaking down why Japan matters more than any headlines right now. How this connects the global debt problem and why crypto sits downstream of these policy choices as we move toward 2026. All right guys, let's jump in and let's set the stage. Governments around the world are running out of room to breathe. Debt piles are enormous. Inflation stays sticky and investors are starting to ask for higher interest payments to lend money. Here's what that means in plain English. When governments borrow, they can sell bonds. Those bonds can last 30 years or just a few months. Lately, buyers have been avoiding the long stuff, and for good reason. They want to get paid back fast because they don't trust inflation to stay low. So the US, Europe, Japan, almost every major economy are issuing more short-term debt, treasury bills instead of long bonds. It keeps the light on, but it builds a timer into the system. Every few months, that debt matures and has to be rolled over at whatever rates exist that day. That's what people mean by a refinancing trap. The shorter the debt, the faster the clock ticks. If short-term rates stay high, interest costs balloon almost overnight. Think about it like refinancing your mortgage every 6 months or your car loan, whatever. You might handle one renewal or two, but if the bank keeps raising rates, eventually the payment crushes you. That's where governments sit right now. The US owes roughly $ 38.5 trillion. Interest alone is on track to become one of the largest budget line items ever. To manage it, leaders have only three levers to pull really. They can cut spending. Yeah, right. Raise revenue through taxes or grow productivity fast enough to outrun the debt. The first two hurt politically. So, the focus has shifted to the third growth through technology, immigration, and efficiency. And here's where Japan loops back in. Because when a country like Japan shifts policy even slightly, one quarter point raise, one tighter liquidity window, it shakes every part of this fragile balance. The global system is so leveraged that one policy move in Tokyo can change borrowing costs in Washington, London, or Seoul or anywhere else overnight. That's the feedback loop. A global debt market leaning on short-term funding can't afford a surprise from one of the world's largest creditor nations. So, governments are racing to build buffers. Anything that buys time or creates growth before higher rates spill through the system. That single choice explains everything that follows in this episode. It's why immigration rules are being rewritten. It's why the new Trump gold card programs are popping up. It's why crypto regulation is being formalized. They're trying to actually grow out of the math before the math catches up. Let's talk about why policy now moves markets more than ever. So, Japan is the quiet variable that tells you how global liquidity is breathing. When the Bank of Japan tightens, the cost of borrowing yen rises. The yen carry trade where traders borrow cheap yen and invest in higher yielding assets elsewhere starts to unwind. That leverage sits everywhere in hedge funds and global equities and yes inside crypto. Right now traders are betting heavily on that quarter point move."

So, Japan is the quiet variable that tells you how global liquidity is breathing. When the Bank of Japan tightens, the cost of borrowing yen rises. The yen carry trade where traders borrow cheap yen and invest in higher yielding assets elsewhere starts to unwind. That leverage sits everywhere in hedge funds and global equities and yes inside crypto. Right now traders are betting heavily on that quarter point move. Roughly a 90% probability based on economist surveys and market pricing. But when you look over here to prediction markets, you can see that uh people are pricing this in at a 97% chance that this rate cut is going to ensue on the 19th. And when that hike actually comes to fruition in just a few days, that cheap funding disappears and risk assets everywhere feel it. That shock would come only if Japan stands still. A pause would trigger a violent short squeeze and traders rush to unwind bearish yen positions. But it's not going to be a pause most likely. This is what I mean when I say policy drives markets more than price. Price reacts and policy steers. Central banks, not traders, are setting the tempo. Every tweak in Tokyo or Washington decides where global liquidity sits. The Bank of Japan provides the fuel. The Fed manages the pipes and crypto ends up showing the heartbeat of that flow. And here's a twist that most people miss. When Japan shakes the tree, it's not just a chart event. It's a test of how stable a new system underneath it really is. Because every time leverage gets pulled, the markets ask one question. Did the plumbing hold? So, to give you some context here, I really obviously I believe that the Bank of Japan is going to raise rates on the 19th. That's why I'm making this video. And historically, every time that they've raised rates since 2022, it's triggered a 15 to 25% draw down in Bitcoin within days. However, we've seen this coming, right? I I mean, this is not a big surprise. We've seen this coming for a long time. So, even though the event is happening in just a few days, I still believe that this is already priced in. So, why are the markets dropping right now? What apparently seems like a sudden event, and I will get to that toward the end of the video. So when Japan shakes markets, the first thing markets test is whether the plumbing can handle it. That's where the Federal Reserve steps in. Over the last 2 years, a massive amount of cash sat parked at the Fed inside a program called the reverse repo facility. Think of it like a savings account for big banks and money funds. They park cash there overnight and earned a small little return. That pool used to be huge, over $2 trillion. But as the US Treasury issued more short-term debt to fund the deficit, that cash got pulled out to buy new tea bills. The piggy bank started to drain. Now, here's the risk. When that pool runs low, lenders get picky. Short-term funding costs jump. The whole system gets nervous because suddenly even safe collateral like treasuries start to look illquid. That's when you hear people mention repo stress. To prevent that freeze up, the Fed has quietly started adding reserves back into the system, not through big public QE programs, but through balance sheet tweaks and targeted repo operations. Here's the simple version. The Fed is topping up the antireeze so the engine doesn't seize. You get it? It's not about stimulus. It's about keeping the pipes from cracking when global liquidity tightens. So, if Japan hikes and funding costs spike, the Fed cushion helps absorb some of the shock, but it doesn't stop volatility, but it limits how far panic can actually spread. That's why recent sell-offs feel shallow compared to 2022 or 2023. They bounce faster because there's still fluid in the system. This quiet back stop is why the macro setup feels weird right now. It feels really weird, right? We keep getting small tremors, but no total break. The plumbing is bending, but it hasn't burst."

It feels really weird, right? We keep getting small tremors, but no total break. The plumbing is bending, but it hasn't burst. Now that we've seen how the Fed keeps the system stable, let's talk about how governments are trying to grow their way out of this trap. The Fed is managing the plumbing. Governments are trying to fix the engine itself. And one of the quietest, most powerful ways they're doing that is through immigration. And I know what you guys are thinking right now. I thought that we were trying to stop all immigration. Well, that's not exactly true. Not if it requires. So, here's a setup with that. When you run out of fiscal space and can't raise taxes or cut spending without political chaos, you look for more ways to grow GDP. More talent, more productivity, more innovation. That's where immigration steps in. The US just overhauled the H1B system. The main work visas for highskilled talent, and the change is massive. Companies used to pay around $5,000 per application. The US just rolled out a new H-1B policy that attaches a $100,000 payment to certain new petitions. A move aimed at filtering for elite global talent. That single change forces employers to be selective. It filters for elite global talent. AI researchers, data engineers, biotech scientists, the kind of people who directly raise national productivity. It's a payto-play system for the highest impact roles. If a company is willing to spend that much just to bring someone in and you know that people like Meta and stuff are giving them $100 $100 million salaries, uh you can bet that person is building something critical or very very talented. Now look at the bigger pattern. At the same time, the US is making it harder to import lowkill labor, making it easier for specialized talent to enter. That combination raises automation incentives when lowerc cost labor tightens. Businesses invest in robotics and AI to fill the gap. Productivity goes up. And it's not just an immigration story. It's a growth strategy. The idea is simple. Bring in the smartest people, push technology forward, and let GDP outrow the debt. This is the quiet foundation for every other policy move we'll talk about today. Because if productivity becomes the escape hatch for the global debt trap, governments are going to do whatever it takes to import the minds that drive it. All right. Well, that covers the talent side. Now, let's look at the other side of the equation. How countries are attracting capital itself, not just people. So, you guys might be asking, so Kyle, has the US ever been able to grow their way out of this debt problem? Well, in 1946, US debt held by the public peaked at around 106% of GDP. By 1974, that ratio had fallen to roughly 23%. And here's where people say love to say that we grew our way out of the debt. Just that data alone isn't enough to actually grow your way out of the debt. I mean, that helped, but there's other things that are were involved. One, they kept interest rates artificially low. They put a cap on them. And additionally, they saw a surprise amount of inflation. And to me, this looks like the same playbook that we're about to come into right now. So, when you hear Trump and everyone else talking about grow the way out of this debt issue, that's the playbook that's worked before, and it looks like they're starting to run that one again. All right. Now, let's talk about revenue. If immigration brings in talent, capital programs bring in cash. This is the other half of the strategy. When governments can't raise taxes without backlash and can't cut spending without paying, and we know they're not doing either of those, they start looking for new ways to generate revenue directly. Enter."

When governments can't raise taxes without backlash and can't cut spending without paying, and we know they're not doing either of those, they start looking for new ways to generate revenue directly. Enter. You've heard this before likely, is the Trump gold card, or what some are calling the American version of the golden visa. It's a residency pathway for high netw worth individuals who contribute large sums of money to the United States. Right now, the figure sits around $1 million per applicant. Here's what makes this different from older investor visas. That money doesn't need to fund a business or create jobs. It's straight financial contribution to the US debt essentially or the US government. Essentially, wealthy applicants are paying the government for access and Washington gets the cash immediately. Now, imagine 50,000 global applicants wiring in $1 million each. That's $50 billion in new federal revenue before a single tax change. It's not a permanent fix for a 38 plus trillion debt load, but it buys time. It stabilizes the optics. This is balance sheet management at a national level. You're seeing governments act like corporations, selling access, optimizing cash flow, and plugging in gaps wherever they can. And when that money comes in, it doesn't just sit idle. It funds the next phase of policy, technology initiatives, infrastructure initiatives, and yes, digital asset investment. That's the hidden thread tying these stories together. Every lever from talent inflows to capital inflows feeds back into the same goal. Grow productivity fast enough to offset debt services, plus other things that we talked about before. Governments are not trying to shrink the machine. They're trying to make it spin faster. All right, now that we've covered how they're funding the strategy, let's look at how they're formalizing it through the rule book that's going to redefine crypto in the years ahead. And I know that some of us are sitting here scratching and wondering who would do that? Who would spend a million dollars to come be part of America and contribute to America's tax system, etc. But guys, there's a lot of places in the world with high net worth individuals who are looking for a safer place to come to. And I think that list is pretty large, even if it involves them paying some taxes. They're very rich and they probably don't care. Or maybe they're retired. Who knows? But it does seem like there was a lot of interest. As Howard Lutnik reported, there were 70,000 applicants when the program was first announced. And now the official portal has just opened uh recently and there was 10,000 applicants already. So first you had Howard Lutnik saying the expected applicants on kind of the top of the funnel, right? So the real revenue that gets brought in, we'll have to wait and see what that is. I don't think it'll be $70 billion, but we'll see. And as it gets rolling out in 2026, we'll see as more and more people do it what the actual number is. Okay. So after talent and capital, the next step in building growth is infrastructure. And in 2025, the biggest infrastructure shift isn't a bridge or a data center. It's legal clarity, at least for us in the cryptoverse. The Clarity Act aims to define what counts as a digital commodity and clarify which agency, the SEC or CFTC, has jurisdiction over different types of digital assets. It distinguishes digital commodities from other types of assets, including those offered in investment contracts or certain stable coins, which helps clear up longunning uncertainty about who regulates what. And here's why that matters. For years, the biggest thing holding institutions back wasn't volatility. It was ambiguity. It was just the everyone's council was just saying, \"No, you guys can't do this.\" Right? Because there was no clear regulations about it. But this bill actually fixes that. It gives institutions a framework. It gives companies a framework who want to launch. It gives crypto projects a framework."

It gives institutions a framework. It gives companies a framework who want to launch. It gives crypto projects a framework. And if you're a bank, you now know which regulator you answer to or what you're allowed to do and what you're not allowed to. You have clarity. If you're a developer, you know how to design within the rules. If you're a large investor, you can build exposure through regulated channels instead of gray market workarounds. This is the same playbook that reshaped finance in the early 2000s. Back then, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act quietly opened the doors for derivatives and that single law helped expand the market from about 100 trillion to above 800 trillion in notional value it is today. And this is according to the BIS data, Bank of International Settlements. The Clarity Act could do for crypto what the bill did for derivatives. It's the legal foundation that turns an experimental market into an industrial one. And the biggest misconception right now is that it's just about compliance, but it's about growth. And when the rules are clear, capital floods in, builders stop hesitating, liquidity deepens. That's why you see banks preparing new custody platforms, stable coin pilots, and tokenization desks even before the bill passes. They already know what's coming. This is the green light moment for institutional adoption, not in price, but in structure. the foundation is being laid for the next phase of capital formation. We see that with Coinbase ICOs. We see Paul Atkins talking about token taxonomy act and how 80% of digital assets that are launched are going to fall under CFTC, not SEC. So, we're starting to see a very bullish environment for the for crypto and digital assets. And so, now that we've talked about the framework, let's talk about who's actually using this framework for Bitcoin and digital assets. Personally, I believe that this clarity act is going to be a big big deal. Why? Because I think that a lot of companies, you know, this is me believing in, you know, in blockchain rails for all the things that we know that it it provides. But I know personally from talking to companies in the web 2 world, traditional companies who want to tokenize their product, who want to bring their app on chain because it will genuinely be more efficient for them to use crypto rails than other payment providers, things like that where they'll actually save on that margin of those fees that are charged from intermediaries. It makes a ton of sense actually. But these guys have been on the sidelines the entire time waiting for the time when clarity actually comes. And now that clarity is actually going to be here, they have the green light to start exploring. And I know firsthand from talking to a lot of these guys that they are looking to do it. So, I think that we're going to get a lot of new launches, TGEs, and things like that in 2026 from everybody having more clarity on what can and cannot be done, what's a security, what's not. And also, if it's a security, it doesn't mean that it's not it's a bad thing. It just means that you have to have different guidelines to launch and issue that token. And when you look at who all the large players are, ETFs, corporates, exchanges, these large players who are holding Bitcoin, they hold an enormous amount. And so when you add those all up, you get about 6 million Bitcoin in these giant hands that are mostly holding these things for the long-term horizon. Of course, not all of them are, but that's a huge amount in the hands of giants. And you do see a shift from short-term to long-term holders, pension funds, sovereigns, things like that. And so these dips of course still happen like we're seeing right now, but they tend to recover faster because supply finds these buyers instantly."

And so these dips of course still happen like we're seeing right now, but they tend to recover faster because supply finds these buyers instantly. Everyone's looking for these dips to buy, and the pipeline keeps expanding. Financial advisers are beginning to recommend Bitcoin the same way that they recommend gold as a small diversified sleeve inside long-term portfolios. Brazil's largest private bank, Italo, even even suggested a 1 to 3% Bitcoin allocation for clients into 2026. That kind of guidance doesn't just influence Brazil. It ripples through the global advisory world, creating a new standard that makes small Bitcoin exposure feel normal, not risky. And if you've been watching the channel, you'll know many other Wall Street banks are recommending the same or even more. And if you're watching behind the scenes, you're seeing that infrastructure is being built up and upgraded everywhere. Custody systems, compliance rails, insurance coverage, all the boring pieces that make the big money feel safe to step in. This is what real adoption looks like. It's not viral Tik Tockers or retail euphoria. It's pension funds, sovereign treasuries, and corporate balance sheets absorbing supply while nobody's watching. The institutions aren't coming. They're already here, guys. Now, let's talk about why all this building underneath, but the market still feels quiet and uncertain. My thoughts are that it's just we're still in this period of time, in this transition phase where we're seeing it in real time. You guys are seeing it. Even this is even this is really funny. Uh Vanguard as you guys know from watching the channel has opened up to people buying the Black Rockck ETFs, IBIT ETFs. But they also came out with a statement recently saying it was like a toy uh and should be treated as such. Right? So a little bit of a of a mixed signal there, but we've seen this time and time again, right? When JP Morgan was quietly getting in behind the scenes buying Bitcoin, they were publicly saying Jaime Diamond was out there saying Bitcoin sucks and anyone getting caught trading it and the firm is going to be fired blah blah blah. But we know at the exact same time he was buying, right? So, is that the card that Vanguard is playing right now? Let me know in the comments below what you guys think. Or is Vanguard is does Vanguard really believe that? I don't think that they do, but let me know in the comments below. and they have a bunch of clients that are demanding it, but they're also putting out their own warnings saying, \"Hey, we don't think this is a good asset, and be very careful if you do do it. We're going to allow you guys to do it, but be careful. Let me know in the comments.\" And guys, I I mean, I'm in chat groups with a lot of uh OGs in the space, and it's kind of crazy how the mentality and the sentiment shift in there. Even even the experienced ones, I mean on Friday they were all bullish. Why? Because Bitcoin was back like 93K. Oh, and now today everyone's back to the doom the doomsdayers saying that uh we're cooked basically. So, this is the part of the market where it gets really, really hard to endure and emotions can get really prominent and we're so focused on short-term price versus long-term horizon on what's happening here. And it's easy to forget to look at the bigger picture and what's going on behind the scenes if you're just focused on short-term price. Interest from the public is the lowest basically we've seen in five years and Google search trends confirms it. Almost nobody outside of the space is paying attention. That's not bearish though. That is exhaustion. After 2 years of non-stop hype, regulation wins and ETF headlines, people tuned out. So even with big old news right now, we're still getting very little reaction. Retail capital is gone. Spectators moved on."

Retail capital is gone. Spectators moved on. And left in the markets now are the quiet hands. institutions building new rails and builders focused on fundamentals. And the data backs that up as well. Driven markets are showing traders de-risking into year end. Options pricing is tight, volatility is compressing, and funding rates are flat. It's the market version of holding your breath. When liquidity dries up like this, the system becomes fragile, but it's also clean. And there's less leverage, there's less noise, and fewer distractions. It's a moment where foundations get tested before the next leg of growth. This market is resetting, not dying. To me, it's clear. Every bull cycle that came before had this phase, a stretch of boredom that disguise real progress. You don't rebuild infrastructure when everyone's screaming about it. You rebuild it when nobody's watching. And that's exactly what's happening right now. Governments are formalizing rules. Institutions are locking supply. Builders are focusing on usability. The audience may have changed, but the work hasn't stopped. It's been going on for a very long time. I mean, we've been talking about this forever, but even in 2017, we knew that people like banks and things were doing trials building infrastructure all for this moment. You know, one of the things that I just keep thinking about too is the fact that we just haven't had any real extremes. Yes, we've had a pullback, right, to $80,000 essentially for Bitcoin from 126, but it still hasn't felt like real capitulation. We didn't get any moment of doom yet like the FTX collapse and we also haven't got any retail blowoff top yet where there was euphoria and hype and all this kind of stuff. I mean retail's been mostly out of this market the entire time. So for me, it really does feel like this midcycle consolidation when you think about the past and when you look about what's happening ahead of us. And crypto is moving out of that phase that we knew from before where it was all memes and hype and retail into a phase of building what really matters, the real builders building real solutions for the real world. And it feels harder right now because it is right. The industry has matured. the the easy edges are gone and success now takes research, discipline, and time in the market. Zenica calls this the hard mode era, the point where crypto starts to resemble online poker after the golden age. In the early days, simple strategies worked. Over time, competition rose, algorithms leveled the playing field, and only the serious players stayed profitable. And maybe they're not even profitable right now, but maybe they are going to be because they're placing the bets in the real conviction plays. The gamblers have had their run. They came and left. And now the builders and long-term thinkers are shaping what comes next. We needed this. We needed maturation in the space. And there will be a time likely probably sometime late next year in my opinion where retail does come back because I do think that there's going to be a flood of liquidity into the United States from everything from uh basically government airdrops or steamy checks uh to things like lower rates and more liquidity coming into the system. But for now, what we're really focused on right now is what everyone seems to be focusing on and where people that still have money are putting money is into upgrading the traditional infrastructure stack. the traditional institutional and tradi stack, right? How do you bring banks on chain? How do you send money across countries? And it's really a bigger poll or deal than you thought. If you haven't seen the episodes yet with Simon Dixon where he talks about who's actually pulling the strings in the world, I suggest that you watch that."

I will do the tiles at the end of the video as well for the Simon Dixon interviews. You should definitely go watch those. Number one, number two. We'll have number three coming up in just a bit as well, probably after the holidays. But really worth checking out so you understand how the power structures work. And if you understand that, you can also see ahead of the game to understand where the money is being put, where the political pressure is being put, where the federal uh policy is being applied, right? And I highly suggest watching those. And back to the Bank of Japan, just sit tight. In my opinion, this is already priced in. And if the remarkable outcome comes where they don't raise rates, then we'll probably get a pump because that's unexpected. But everyone fully expects and it's probably priced in right now that they're going to raise rates on the 19th. So now, like I promised to you guys earlier, so why did we crash basically yesterday and today? Well, it's because the Fed next chair became less clear than we thought it was. And so right now is the battle of the Kevins. And if you look over here in poly market, you see that it's the battle of the cavats essentially. And if this is the past week, but you can start to see over here on December 12th is when things started to shift. And now just today, this switch to where actually this new guy Kevin Worsh is at 48% of of odds. and Kevin Hassat who we actually all thought was going to become see really high odds back here 72% just 5 days ago or even actually even just 2 days ago 3 days ago but now this has switched but it's still very very close and too early to tell this could switch at any minute but to give you the TLDDR both the Kevin believe in lowering rates but this Kevin Worsh guy is a bit more in the mindset that full-blown easing through printing and everything else uh is the inverse of the Robin Hood idea, right? It's it is actually, you know, creating a bigger wealth gap, which is actually true. And if you guys want to watch more on this, uh I suggest that you go watch Elio Trades video that he made uh yesterday talking a live stream he did talking about this uh the video is called the uh the Fed rugpole or something like that, but he goes into more depth on this. But the TLDDR is essentially the fact that yeah that now we have uncertainty and this is exactly what is causing the price dip right now. So again you have some short-term speculation and another reason remember guys the Bitcoin foundation is stronger than ever. The long-term road map is stronger than ever. But we're going to, like I've said before time and time again over the past several months is expect volatility for a while and we could drop to $70,000 or more or less, but we could drop significantly from here still. So remember to be careful with playing with leverage, guys. So when it comes down to Japan, guys, on the 19th, you don't FOMO if they keep rates the same, and you don't sell into fear if they tighten again, right? You just recognize it for what it is. It's another turn in the exact same cycle we've been talking about. Remember, education compounds faster than capital right here. When you understand how global debt works, central bank plumbing and real world rails connect. Every headline becomes a clue instead of shock. So, as we move through this window, stay grounded. Take a breath, guys. You're early, you're informed, and you're positioned with a clear road map."
