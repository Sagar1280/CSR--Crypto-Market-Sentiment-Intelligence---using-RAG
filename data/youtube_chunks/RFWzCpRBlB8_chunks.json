      "text": "Yo, welcome everyone. Today I want to show you the next bearish price target for Bitcoin because Ethereum on the other hand has already hit this very nice level. Now, first you're going to see Bitcoin only a few hours ago hit our weekly and also the daily height from time frame area of support at approximately $87,500 US. And it really does look like both of the levels were hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy from where we are right now getting a bounce towards the upside of approximately 3.6%. Now this specific price action it really does look like it was potentially affected by some kind of news. But personally I don't really trade the news. I don't really pay attention to the news. Why so? Because there is a very famous quote. Show me the chart and I will tell you the news. I definitely did not know what is going to happen at this specific area. However, I knew exactly where potentially Bitcoin could get a bounce off of and it really does look like even if bearish or bullish news were released, we hit our weekly, we hit our daily and right now clearly we are also getting a beautiful reaction back towards the upside. So far I also do remain in my short trade on Bitcoin, on Ethereum, XRP and also Solana. And later in the video, I'm even going to share with you exactly where potentially we can be looking for another long or a buy position on Bitcoin and also potentially on Ethereum. Now, also with this entire bounce towards the upside, what is the level that Bitcoin is right hitting almost to the exact dollar accuracy? Pay attention to our SN triangle. We also talked about already a few days ago. Bitcoin broke the triangle back down and right now we are maybe even trying to get another acceptance back in the triangle. One could even say it's only going to be a bearish retest of our trend line before simply continuing lower. Now, if you do ask me, would I actually enter a brand new short or a sell position right here? To be honest, not really. Sure, it could be a bearish retest. Sure, Bitcoin could also go right here lower towards downside. However, looking right now at this specific price action, I would rightly say to you like this. Because we are pushing lower, I would much rather fire another long or a buy trade exactly at an important area of support. What is this level going to be? Let's right now actually go on the Ethereum chart because Ethereum also has been pushing quite impulsively towards the downside for the past few days. And what you're going to see right here, only a few hours ago, we took the liquidity exactly below our recent low right here at approximately $2,900. Now, why was this specific level such an important one? Pay attention to the structure at this specific area, exactly the same as Bitcoin. Ethereum has been forming a lot of higher lows. We got the first higher low right here. Then another higher low, just slightly higher. And then also another higher low just slightly higher at approximately $2,900. So you can right to see four liquidity levels were actually hit only a few hours ago and only after the liquidity was taken right now Ethereum is getting some kind of a bounce back towards the upside. Also right here pay attention to the structure on the 2hour time frame. It really does look impulsive. So what could that potentially mean? In my opinion, Ethereum could right now be forming the fourth alien wave. So what we can right say we got right here an impulse we got a correction another impulse towards upside right now potentially forming our fourth alien wave before getting another push towards to be honest right here I'm literally expecting almost the exact same thing to happen on BTC. So ideally, yes, I'm looking for another push down. Bitcoin hitting another very important support level that is going to be literally almost exactly the same as right here on Ethereum. Because pay right now attention to this specific price action. Literally almost exactly the same as on the Ethereum chart. Bitcoin has been forming the first low right here. Then we got another higher low. Then of course also another higher low was formed and then also another higher low. Four important liquidity levels were formed exactly at this specific area, but so far it does look like none of them has actually gotten hit. So that is why ideally I'm still looking for another push down before Bitcoin potentially getting a bigger bounce back towards the upside."

That is right now why I would really appreciate for you to smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible and of course also thank you for subscribing to the channel. Let's right now also talk about the bearish Elliot wave count. We can write to see on the 2hour time frame. So if we write to note that usually liquidity gets taken before a bigger bounce towards the upside. Definitely we can write to say there is actually quite a high probability of Bitcoin getting another push towards the downside sooner rather than later. So how could that right now translate to our bearish ele? Let's go and let's zoom in on the 1 hour time frame where we are going to go with our aliot impulsive wave. We can write a say we got right here an impulsive move towards upside. We got a correction. Bitcoin also only a few hours ago completed the third Ali wave potentially right now we are forming the fourth one before Bitcoin is going to get another push towards side for our fifth aliot wave for us to then finally take the liquidity below all of our recent loss right here. Then ideally we are going to get a bigger bounce towards the upside for our bigger second all wave. So how exactly could this right here look like? So let me right now actually change our ali waves right here to the smaller count and we are right now going to say if this specific fifth alien wave is going to get finished in the upcoming days in the upcoming hours. We can then also say okay bitcoin finished the first bigger impulsive all right here we are going to form the second one then of course the third one fourth one and the fifth one. And because of that, if we are going to be paying attention towards the bigger bounce towards the upside, what is then going to be the exact price target you should really pay attention to for our second all wave where potentially of course we could be looking to fire another short trade on Bitcoin or simply for us to add even more capital to our already existing short positions on Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and also Solana. what we can write to do for our second elite wave. The usual price target is actually at least the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level or ideally the golden Fibonacci ratio. What we can right do? Let's go with our Fibonacci retracement from our swing high back towards the low. Now, of course, if Bitcoin is right now already going to get a push towards the upside, we need to place our Fibonacci retracement exactly at this specific low. However, ideally right now as we said, we are still looking for another push down. We take the liquidity right here and only then we start forming our second Allen wave. That is why I am going to adjust our Fibonacci ratio to a slightly lower price target slightly below our liquidity level at approximately $86,000. And of course, also one very important thing, if you are following me on Twitter, you probably also know that yesterday I posted this specific chart looking for something like this on Bitcoin. And yes, we were talking about the value area low, the bottom volume support level aligning with the gold Fibonacci ratio aligning with all of our liquidity levels. That is right now why of course this specific area is really not a random price target. Let's right now also go with the price targets of our second alien wave because of course if we do get a bounce towards the upside, Bitcoin is going to start forming the second Ali wave."

Let's right now also go with the price targets of our second alien wave because of course if we do get a bounce towards the upside, Bitcoin is going to start forming the second Ali wave. And you can right now see the most common levels, the 0.5, the golden Fibonacci ratio and also the 0.786 and the 0.854 Fibonacci retracement price targets. All of them right here are actually some kind of important ones. But the thing is the golden Fibonacci ratio is usually being respected the most nicely. And why are all of those price targets in my opinion right here such an important levels? What we are right now going to do, let's right now very very simply go with our volume levels measuring right now the entire bottom price action with volume. What you're right going to see the point of control is going to come in very very close towards our 0.5. But the golden fibonage ratio is going to align even better with the value area high. The most important levels I would be aware of right here are definitely going to be value area high and the point of control ideally of course as we said the golden fibonach ratio. Why so? Because it also does align at least as of right now very nicely with the anchored VWAP when we anchor it exactly at this specific high. Sure, the anchored VWAP is curving down, but the reality right now is if Bitcoin is going to get a push towards the upside, ideally we want to see a nice alignment with the golden pocket value area high and also the anchored view. But also right here, if we are zooming in, you can definitely see another liquidity level is going to come in literally exactly at our golden Fibonacci ratio. if the bounce is going to happen maybe already right now or simply in the upcoming days. This right here is one of the best price targets you can definitely pay attention to where potentially you might be looking for another short trade on Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and also Solana.

Also, right now, let's talk about our liquidations because what we said before the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level right here could also be another very important level. Paying attention to the oneweek liquidation heat map, you can right now actually see bigger liquidations on Bitcoin are going to be exactly above those specific highs right here at approximately $96,000. where approximately $160 million of short trades are going to get liquidated. So you can rightly see $96,000 US area it is aligning quite nicely with both of our higher Fibonacci retracement price targets also right now. Why ideally in the upcoming hours we are still looking for another push towards downside pretty much for the exact price target to be hit as it was on Ethereum only a few hours ago. Pay right now attention to the RSI and also to the MACD and money flow indicator on the 2hour time frame. All of them pretty much right now are forming a hidden bearish divergence. So you can write notice right here we are forming a higher high on money flow. Lower high being formed on Bitcoin, higher high on RSI, lower high on Bitcoin, higher high on MACD, lower high on Bitcoin."

Lower high being formed on Bitcoin, higher high on RSI, lower high on Bitcoin, higher high on MACD, lower high on Bitcoin. All of those indicators are right now forming a hidden bearish divergence which technically speaking it is definitely going to be a bearish Bitcoin indication. That is why right now I am telling to you ideally I still want to get another push down before Bitcoin potentially then hitting our major golden Fibonacci ratio or at least the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level right here at approximately 92,000 US area. Additionally, pay right now attention to the exponential moving averages on the 4hour time frame. In the upcoming hours, probably we are going to get right here a bearish cross. That is then going to mean Bitcoin is moving in a significant downtrend not only on the 4hourly also on the 2hourly also on the 1 hourly time frame. That is why right now of course if we are then going to form our fifth all wave sure a bounce can happen towards the upset but we are then going to know Bitcoin is moving in a downtrend. Lower targets are slightly more likely in the upcoming days and of course we are going to be paying attention to the crypto fear and greed index especially if Bitcoin is going to be pushing even lower in the upcoming days because why so pay right now attention to the last time we were in the extreme fear area. Right now we are only in the fear area potentially even going in the neutral zone if Bitcoin is already going to get a bounce towards the upside. But the reality is usually the best buy positions are going to be offered to us once the crypto fear and greed index is going in the extreme fear. It also happened right here back in March 2025. The crypto fear and greed index was in the extreme fear. We got a major bounce towards the upside afterwards. Also right here we were in the extreme fear only a few days ago. We of course also have gotten quite a nice bounce towards the upside in the past few weeks. And also of course if Bitcoin does continue lower right here, we hit the extreme fear area on the crypto fear and grid index. Ideally of course also we start seeing the RSI indicator going in the oversold area on the daily time frame. In my opinion quite a significant and a very nice long or a buy position could be offered to us. right now in terms of the trades I would simply select that the best long trade I see right now in the upcoming days is simply going to be if Bitcoin does get a push down we take the liquidity below our recent lows and also one very important thing you can then simply pay attention to the RSI indicator if there is going to be a push down right here reaction towards the upside RSI forming a higher low right here you're going to get a bullish divergence at a beautiful area of support reaction could mean completed swing failure pattern or a liquidity grab, you potentially could be looking for another long or a buy position with of course proper stop-loss placement, proper position size, and of course also the price target. You need to know if you're going to go with a long trade right here, potentially we are going to be going against the bigger trend because clearly as we said, the exponential moving averages right now are looking slightly more bearish. However, we know a beautiful level is going to get hit and if we are going to get a successful liquidity grab with a bullish RSI divergence right here, in my opinion, it is still much better to try and buy low and potentially then of course if we do get a bounce towards the upside to sell high and take the profit. That is right."
