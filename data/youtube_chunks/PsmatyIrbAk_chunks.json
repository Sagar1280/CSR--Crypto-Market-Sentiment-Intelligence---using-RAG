      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coinbau Trading. Today, we're going to talk about why today is going to be crazy for the crypto market. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different. And if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, I want to start off, guys, by pointing out that my prediction on Monday was correct. I predicted that inflation would come in lower than expected and that this would basically trigger a rally in the markets. It was one of the reasons why I said this week would be big for crypto. Uh and another reason, of course, being the Trump tariff ruling, which is going to come later today. I'll get to that in just a second. But I do need to point out something very important here, guys. And that's that most of the rally that we've seen over the last 24 hours or so has been driven basically by a short squeeze. You can see that there's been around $600 million uh in shorts uh basically squeezed, liquidated. And what this means that it's kind of like automated buying. And this is really important to point out because when you're doing technical analysis and analyzing the charts, it's important to kind of differentiate between price action that's driven by, you know, people that are actively buying and selling versus uh basically price action that's driven by like a mechanical triggering of some uh limit or something, right? Uh and technical analysis really only works when you're analyzing human emotions like human trading. When you're dealing with something like this, you're dealing with something that's going to, you know, like violate some short-term indicators. Uh, and of course that's kind of the point some people would say is that uh what whales tend to do is that they like to push prices above and below key levels to cause these kinds of liquidations. And of course, it's been a while since we've seen a nice short squeeze. But this brings me to the kind of a key catalyst for today. And this is one that I think is could result in lots of volatility. On the flip side, it could be a nothing burger because maybe the Supreme Court will delay their decision on Trump's tariffs. You guys might remember the Supreme Court was supposed to decide about that last Friday. Then it was moved to this Wednesday. Okay, so later today at around 10:00 a.m. we should be getting uh information about that. But uh you know it might not come out and might end up being a nothing burger or it will come out and it could be very mixed, very nuanced, right? Like it might take time for the markets to digest and figure out what it means. Some of you guys might know that there's been a lot of comments about how even if the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs, there's other ways that Trump could introduce tariffs. But what's really interesting is that recently here there's reports that Trump was saying apparently if the Supreme Court rules against tariffs, we're screwed. which doesn't sound like someone who has like a backup plan. Maybe he's just, you know, playing around or doesn't know what he's talking about. Some people would argue that's the case. Um, but regardless, guys, uh I do think that it would be uh pretty uh beneficial for the markets if the Supreme Court was to strike down Trump's tariffs simply because it would result in the US dollar falling because basically it would be priced in. I imagine by the markets that the supply of US dollars is going to increase not just domestically as a result of tariff refunds, but also internationally because tariffs kind of like restrict the flow of US dollars overseas. And if the tariffs are struck down, that means more US dollars going overseas, more liquidity going overseas, which would be positive for the markets. Uh again, if you want my take on what's going to happen with the Supreme Court ruling, I honestly have no idea. The only thing I can kind of say for sure here, guys, is that in the short term, crypto prices have rallied quite a bit here, of course, over the last 24 hours. So, a pullback later today would be expected."

The only thing I can kind of say for sure here, guys, is that in the short term, crypto prices have rallied quite a bit here, of course, over the last 24 hours. So, a pullback later today would be expected. Based on the charts, I it looks like today is just going to be another day of chop and then tomorrow when we get uh the Clarity Act discussion, that might be the catalyst that causes markets to continue going higher. But in the short term here, it does look like Bitcoin is going to have a little bit of a pullback here. I'm not calling for a massive crash or anything. Probably just a drop down maybe somewhere to around 93,000 for Bitcoin. And this is actually supported, guys, by this liquidation heat map. As you guys will know, basically the liquidation heat map here basically shows you at what price most people would get liquidated uh at least here in the short term. Some of you might know that these crypto whales, like I mentioned earlier, they like to kind of like quote unquote grab liquidity. They like to go and basically get all these traders wrecked. So, a drop down here somewhere to around 93,000 or even into the 92,500 range uh later today that wouldn't be out of the ordinary. That would be completely normal after the type of rally that we've seen here. You have a huge thrust higher, a retest of the support level, and then a continuation higher. And again, rather than a specific level, just always think of these levels as kind of being more like zones. So here the zone would be again somewhere between 92,500 let's say and 93,300. So somewhere in that zone is probably where prices will fall later today and then we're likely to see a continuation higher later this week starting tomorrow especially if things are positive with the clarity act discussions. Of course Ethereum similar story here. I do expect a pullback in Ethereum somewhere probably to around 3200 back into the zone here somewhere around around 3200 let's say to 3270 or something like that. Again, same idea. If we look at the liquidation heat map here for Ethereum, you can see lo and behold that somewhere just under 3,300, there's some liquidity that wants to be grabbed. There's a little bit more somewhere around 3,250. So, somewhere in that range, let's say between 3,250, 3,300. We would likely see some some uh some liquidity grab there with uh market makers going down, pushing prices down just a little bit, you know, just to just to get a little bit more liquidations in. And uh you know hopefully that won't be too uh crazy but I do think that the result is just it's just going to be some chop here over the next couple of days and then a continuation higher. And uh one chart to watch of course I've been pointing this chart out for a while is ETHBTC. Of course as you guys know like the way the crypto market works is that when when money first flows in the crypto market it starts in uh Bitcoin then it flows into Ethereum then it flows into the rest of the crypto market. I've been pointing out here that of course we saw ETHBTC falling for this entire cycle. In other words, you could say that since May of 2025, ETHB BTC has been kind of like in a long-term uptrend. Of course, it did kind of enter a medium-term downtrend since last summer. But the fact of the matter is that we've seen again higher uh higher lows essentially indicative of a new long-term uptrend almost over the last year here. And if we do see ETHBTC break above this resistance level somewhere around 0.035 on the daily, which looks like it could happen here in the next week or two. I do expect it by the end of the month."

If that does happen, then we're likely to see, of course, ETH outperform Bitcoin and eventually we would see rotation into altcoins. And I do think it's worth again zooming out just to show where we are on the long term here with the trusty Ballinger bands. Uh basically a move above well I guess 0.035 if we get a proper break above that level. You can see that's the Ballinger band moving average on the weekly and it looks like it's squeezing. So that would basically probably for foreshadow a a massive squeeze to the upside here for ETHBTC probably somewhere to the 0.055 055 range which would translate to a 50% gain uh for Bitcoin relative sorry for Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. So assuming Bitcoin is around 100K then ETH would you know rally up to around 5K let's say um but uh of course Bitcoin assuming we get a rally in the broader crypto market Bitcoin would be higher so the ETH price there would be much higher. We'll just have to take things one step at a time. Again in the short term in my in my mind the most important chart here to watch over the next couple of days will be ETHBTC and of course I'll be doing an update about that tomorrow. Um, the last thing I want to mention here, guys, is something that I'm sure you're probably not going to hear anywhere else. Something that's actually very fascinating, a little bit speculative, but I do want to put this on your radar because I again, I don't think this is any any anyone's going to be talking about this today, I don't think. And that's that uh basically banks are going to be uh publishing some earnings for uh for Q4. They're going to be doing that before the markets open later today before US markets open. And you may be wondering like like who cares? It's just the banks reporting their earnings. Well, here's where things get really interesting, guys. As you guys might know, I mean some of you might know that uh what triggered the collapse I guess I guess I should go back a little bit further. As you guys know, the 2008 financial crisis was caused by like uh basically the housing market, right? There was a bubble in housing debt and all these institutions especially banks had purchased a bunch of mortgage back securities. Basically, they bought a whole bunch of of mortgage debt, a whole bunch of housing debt. The basically the people who took on that debt were not creditworthy and they were not able to repay it. Uh and what's interesting is that over the summer of uh 2007, that's when you saw kind of like the first draw down when they started discovering, hey, there's problems with the housing market. But then the Fed kind of stepped in and then you saw another rally to new all-time highs later in 2007 and then you saw a continuation lower. What's really interesting is that this continuation lower, especially in the early part of uh of 2008, that continuation lower, believe it or not, guys, was driven by uh banks basically revealing saying, \"Hey, we have more of these mortgages on our balance sheet. We didn't know that we had this much exposure to housing. That was the thing that really triggered, you could say, the start of the 2008 financial crisis. Like you had that initial kind of like crack, which was like that people realized something was wrong in housing and then the actual breakage was when banks said, \"Hey, we're really exposed to this stuff and we might have a lot of losses here.\""

Like you had that initial kind of like crack, which was like that people realized something was wrong in housing and then the actual breakage was when banks said, \"Hey, we're really exposed to this stuff and we might have a lot of losses here.\" And what's really interesting is that this kind of parallels what we've seen with private credit where, you know, last fall in September, I think it was of last year, we started to hear these kind of cracks and news about maybe I'll fast forward here so we can see what it looks like on the chart. last year. If we zoom in here, apologies guys, lots of uh lots of old drawings here. I'll explain those in just a second. But if we zoom back here guys, again to uh to basically to late last year, you can see that there was a pretty nasty draw down, a couple of draw downs actually in the in the broader markets. And in my mind, this kind of price action that we saw here, this kind of volatility, it again, it was caused arguably by concerns around private credit. And it looks to me very similar uh to what we saw again in the summer of 200 um and and seven. And not only that guys, but you might remember the FedE stopped doing QT and they kind of stepped in with quote unquote not QEQE, right? So it's similar that you you know we see a drop because people are concerned about private credit. Then we have the Fed kind of stepping in with basically what is QE to kind of support liquidity in the markets. You guys might remember that term, you know, to manage market liquidity or whatever. And then since that time, of course, we've seen a rally to new all-time highs. And now banks are about to report their earnings. I guess longwinded way of saying is that what we could see later today is that these banks could reveal and say, \"Hey, we have more private credit on our books than we initially anticipated. We're going to have more losses as a result of this.\" And this could result in a kind of pullback, I guess, at the beginning of a pullback in the large cap stocks similar to what we saw in the two basically at the start of 2008 where banks reported that they said, \"Hey, we have too much we have more exposure to mortgages, to housing that we than we thought. We're going to have to write write off these losses.\" We could see the same thing here with private credit basically later today. And if that announcement does come out, then this kind of ascending wedge pattern here that we that the S&P 500 has been drawing basically since uh since December, we could see a fall out of this ascending wedge. Of course, it's a bearish pattern and we could see a drop. It's actually we could even extend it back further. We could say the ascending wedge has kind of been, you know, going something like this, right? It's been like going on for, you know, since November. You could make the argument. So, if we do see a drop out of this ascending wedge pattern, of course, that would be bad for the markets. Uh, but it could potentially be bullish for I guess one thing to keep in mind is it could be bullish for the crypto market especially. Maybe I'll even type it in here. Let's take a quick look at the Russell 2000 because it's really fascinating guys of course is the Russell 2000 has broken out here and breakouts in the Russell 2000 historically corresponded to breakouts in the crypto market. And what a lot of people don't understand is that even when the large cap stocks when the S&P 500 starts falling, you can still see rallies in small caps. So the idea that we would see a a pullback in the larger markets and a rally in small caps would not be out of the question."

And some would argue that's kind of what we've seen over the last couple of days where large cap stocks, you know, they did kind of peak out, but small cap stocks in crypto continued rallying even though yesterday I believe was a red day for uh for the S&P 500. So that's just something to keep in mind. Again, I apologize for the rambling. Uh but this is something again that I don't think anyone is watching and something to keep on your radar. If you start to see markets falling all of a sudden, you know, before US markets open, uh, go and check and see if it has to do with bank earnings and chances are it will that they say, \"Hey, we have exposure to private credit. Um, you know, we need to write off these losses now.\" Long-winded way of saying is that yeah, I do think there's going to be a pullback here probably today. Pullback, a little slight pullback, a little bit of chop just to grab liquidity here for Bitcoin, for Ethereum, for the broader crypto market, and then we should see hopefully a continuation higher after that.
