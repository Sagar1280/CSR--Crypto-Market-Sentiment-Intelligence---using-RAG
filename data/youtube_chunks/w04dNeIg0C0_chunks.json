      "text": "It's believed that Bitcoin lags gold by around 3 \nmonths. If this is indeed the case, then gold's   massive rally at the end of 2025 should translate \nto a massive rally for Bitcoin at the beginning of   2026. However, this assumes that there's rotation \nbetween Bitcoin and gold since Bitcoin is seen   as digital gold by investors. The truth though is \nthat the relationship between Bitcoin and gold is   much more complex. That's why today we're going to \ndo a deep dive into the dynamics between Bitcoin   and gold to figure out what it means for the price \nof both assets in the coming months. This is a   video you can't afford to miss. Before we begin, \nyou need to know that nothing in this video is   financial or investment advice. It's educational \ncontent intended to inform you about the nuanced   relationship between Bitcoin and gold. If you want \nto see more of this kind of content in your feed,   smash that like button to give this video a boost \nin your algorithm. Subscribe to the channel and   turn on notifications if you haven't already. Now, let's start with a surface level analysis   of Bitcoin and gold, and then we'll go down the \nrabbit hole. In theory, investors see Bitcoin,   specifically the BTC coin, as a safe haven \nlike gold. Hence why there's a relationship   between the two. That's because just like gold, \nBTC has a fixed supply, can be self-custodied,   is not controlled by any individual or group \nof individuals or institutions, and so on. In practice, most investors still see BTC as \na risk asset, specifically as a higher risk,   higher reward bet on tech stocks, particularly \ntech indices like the NASDAQ. Notably,   this is technically true for investors who see \nBTC as digital gold, too, because most of them   also see BTC as a higher risk, higher reward bet \non gold. This makes BTC more like digital silver   than digital gold. And you'll see why that's \nsignificant later. Anyways, the fact that BTC   is seen as a risk asset by most investors and even \ntreated as a de facto risk asset by investors who   see it as digital gold means that BTC lies on the \nopposite end of the risk spectrum from gold. Gold   is a true safe haven. This is because of the \ncharacteristics I mentioned a few moments ago   and because gold has historically been seen as \na store of value by everyone everywhere for well   millennia. With this in mind, the apparent lag \nbetween Bitcoin and gold starts to make sense,   and it becomes apparent that the rotation \nhas nothing to do with the gold digital gold   relationship. It instead has everything to do \nwith risk. When gold is rising, it's typically   a sign that investors are concerned about what's \ngoing on in the markets and the economy. In this   riskoff environment, risky assets like BTC \ntend to perform poorly. When gold is falling,   it's typically a sign that investors are feeling \nconfident about what's going on in the markets and   the economy. This creates a riskon environment, \nwhich will cause risky assets like BTC to rise,   especially if there are significant catalysts \nthat bring attention and investment to the crypto   market. The result is something that looks like \na lagged rotation between BTC and gold, and it   technically is. But again, this lagged rotation \nhas less to do with the relationship between BTC   and gold and more to do with the risk off or risk \non environment in the background. Case in point,   when the pandemic started in 2020, gold's price \nrallied while BTC crashed due to the riskoff   environment. By the summer of 2020, however, \nunprecedented stimulus by central banks and   governments gave rise to a riskon environment. The \nresult was that gold's price fell in the autumn of   2020 and this corresponded to a massive rally in \ncrypto with many altcoins hitting their cycle tops   in the spring of 2021 just as gold was bottoming. Once again, this makes perfect sense. The initial   rising gold signaled a riskoff environment \nwherein crypto crashed and the subsequent   falling gold signaled a riskon environment wherein \ncrypto rallied while gold fell. If you need more   evidence, look no further than the autumn of \n2024 when gold fell while aggregate measures of   altcoins, like others, hit multi-year highs. The \nfact that gold's price continued rallying after   that could be the reason why altcoins continued \nfalling after that. It wasn't because gold was   draining liquidity from altcoins. It was because \ngold was signaling a riskoff environment wherein   crypto struggles. So, this begs the question of \nwhat will happen to crypto when gold's most recent   rally ends and gold prices start to fall. At first \nglance, you might think it will be a crypto rally."

It was because gold was signaling a riskoff environment wherein crypto struggles. So, this begs the question of what will happen to crypto when gold's most recent rally ends and gold prices start to fall. At first glance, you might think it will be a crypto rally. Upon closer inspection, however, you realize \nthat gold's price rallied when crypto topped   in late 2021 and it rallied when crypto topped in \nearly 2018. So, this suggests that there's more to   this risk rotation than meets the eye. And that's \nbecause there is. But before we go down the rabbit   hole, you have to check out the Coin Bureau deals \npage. That's where you'll find signup bonuses of   up to $100,000, trading fee discounts of up to \n50% and deposit cashbacks of up to 75% on the best   crypto exchanges. To get these goodies, all you \nneed to do is hit the link in the description or   scan this QR code. And once you get on the deals \npage, find a deal that suits you and click one   of the sign up now buttons. These deals won't be \naround forever though, so take advantage of them   while you can using the link in the description \nbelow or the QR code on your screen. Right,   to quickly recap, BTC is seen as a risk asset \nby most investors and even investors who see it   as digital gold treat it as a higher risk, higher \nreward version of gold, i.e. also as a risk asset. Conversely, gold is seen as a safe haven by most \ninvestors. So it makes sense that crypto falls   when gold rallies and that gold falls when crypto \nrallies. It's what happens when capital moves from   risk off to risk on respectively. The caveat is \nwhat I mentioned earlier and that's that we've   seen periods where gold and crypto would rally \ntogether, namely when the crypto market topped in   early 2018 and late 2021. We've also seen periods \nwhere gold and crypto would crash together,   namely when crypto bottomed in late 2018 and in \nlate 2022. This change in correlation has to do   with the change in gold's demand drivers over its \ncycle. As most of you will know, central banks   have been increasing their allocations to gold \nsince some reserves of Russia's central bank were   frozen following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This freezing sent a signal that western assets   used as reserves were no longer safe to hold as \nreserves in size, particularly government bonds. Since gold was previously used as reserves, \nit's the logical alternative to accumulate. At the same time, many investors around the world \nhave been accumulating gold too. In China's case,   the collapse of the housing market, which was \npreviously the safe haven for most investors,   has resulted in investors there looking for \nalternatives. Precious metals are once again   the most logical alternative as they aren't as \naffected by Chinese Communist Party policies. For   context, China's housing boom and bust was caused \nby Communist Party policy. In the case of Western   countries like the US, many investors there have \nalso been hesitant to allocate to bonds due to   excessive government spending and political risks \nand they've been hesitant to allocate to stocks   because of the concentration and bubble risks. This has likewise resulted in allocations into   gold. The catch is that the buying pressure \nof central banks and these investors pushed   gold prices up a lot. And the result was that \ngold started to attract speculative investors   both from stocks and crypto. And this is where \nthings get interesting. We can get a sense of   how much of gold's price action has been driven by \nspeculation by looking at search trends for terms   like gold and gold price. As expected, trends \nfor these search terms started going vertical in   the summer of 2025 when gold started breaking \nout again. Put simply, it looks like gold's   rally from around $2,200 at the start of 2024 to \n$3,400 in the summer of 2025 was driven primarily   by fundamentals accumulation by central banks and \nriskoff investors. However, the rally from $3,400   to the recent high of $4,600 was driven primarily \nby speculation."

We can get a sense of how much of gold's price action has been driven by speculation by looking at search trends for terms like gold and gold price. As expected, trends for these search terms started going vertical in the summer of 2025 when gold started breaking out again. Put simply, it looks like gold's rally from around $2,200 at the start of 2024 to $3,400 in the summer of 2025 was driven primarily by fundamentals accumulation by central banks and riskoff investors. However, the rally from $3,400 to the recent high of $4,600 was driven primarily by speculation. Additional evidence of this can be   seen in the fact that higher risk, higher reward \nbets on gold rallied during this period. And these   include gold miners and silver, both of which \nhave been ripping since the summer of 2025. When   such high beta plays are also going parabolic, you \nknow that speculation in precious metals is rising   fast. In other words, risk on investors are piling \ncapital into gold, silver, and other precious   metals. When speculation becomes the dominant \ndriver, the correlation between gold and crypto   becomes positive. And that is basically why there \nwere periods where crypto was inversely correlated   to gold and periods where it was positively \ncorrelated to gold. When it was primarily   risk off investors allocating to gold, its price \nwould rise and crypto prices would fall. But when   it was primarily risk on investors allocating to \ngold, its price would rise and crypto prices would   also rise. I'll explain why they haven't a little \nlater. First though, I need to underscore the fact   that speculative flows currently dominate gold \nand precious metals more broadly. In our view,   the biggest giveaway that speculative flows are in \ncontrol is the fact that many YouTubers who often   talk about gold are promoting services that offer \nyield on gold paid in gold. The fact that even   respected YouTubers are promoting these services \nnow suggests there's lots of revenue there. Anyone   who's been in crypto for more than a few years \nwill know that when yield starts getting offered   like this, it means both speculation and leverage \nare rising fast. And when this speculation runs   out and the leverage unwinds, gold's price could \nfall sharply. As I just explained, this fall would   be due to force sales from risk on investors and \nit could correspond to another leg lower in the   crypto market, not rotation. Now to quickly recap, \ncrypto prices tend to rise when gold prices fall   and gold prices tend to fall when crypto prices \nrise. However, this inverse correlation can become   positive when riskon speculative capital starts \nto become the primary demand driver for gold. This is arguably what we've seen since the summer \nof 2025. And this suggests that a crash in gold   could be bearish for crypto, not bullish for \ncrypto. And this is where the rabbit hole goes   really deep because everything I just mentioned \nis ultimately driven by the liquidity cycle. To bring you up to speed, liquidity is a fancy \nword for money in the economy and the markets. Michael Howell is the leading expert in global \nliquidity and he's been predicting that liquidity   will peak in late 2025 or in early 2026. Now many \ninterpreted this as bullish for riskon assets like   crypto. The thing is that the most bullish phase \nof the liquidity cycle for risk on assets is when   liquidity is rising, not when it's peaking. As you \ncan see in this image here, if you look closely,   you'll notice that the peak of the liquidity \ncycle corresponds to rallies and cycle tops for   commodities, which includes precious metals. In \ncase you missed it, other commodities like copper   and coffee have been rallying in recent months, \ntoo. This is consistent with Howell's forecast   that liquidity would peak around this time and \nconsistent with his asset allocation framework   which notes that commodities rally the most when \nliquidity peaks. In case you didn't notice, what   follows the liquidity peak is a liquidity drawdown \nwhich is bearish for all assets. That's because   there's a scramble for cash. Hence why cash is the \nasset to hold at that phase. What's fascinating is   that how believes that the global liquidity cycle \nis driven by the debt refinancing cycle. In short,   individuals and institutions around the world need \nto roll over their debts every four to 5 years."

Hence why cash is the asset to hold at that phase. What's fascinating is that how believes that the global liquidity cycle is driven by the debt refinancing cycle. In short, individuals and institutions around the world need to roll over their debts every four to 5 years. This rolling over of debt causes liquidity to fall \nin the same way that paying off your entire credit   card balance means that you have less money \nleft to spend on other things. Imagine that,   but on a global scale. Now consider that the \nworld's wealthiest individuals and institutions   keep as much money in assets as they possibly can. Be they stocks, crypto, or precious metals. When   it's time to refinance their debts, they must \nsell these assets for cash. Which is again why   framework suggests holding cash during a liquidity \ncontraction. And in case it wasn't clear enough,   liquidity is expected to contract in 2026. This \nis just because there's a huge debt refinancing   wall in 2026. This begs a bigger question then of \nhow to tell when that wall is starting to drain   liquidity from the markets. The short answer is to \nlook at the DXY which measures the strength of the   US dollar against a basket of other currencies. If the DXY is rising, the demand for cash is   increasing and assets are likely to fall in price. If the DXY keeps falling, assets will keep rising. As some of you will know, there's a strong inverse \ncorrelation between gold and the DXY. When the   DXY rises, gold tends to fall. And as we've \njust learned, there is a lot of speculation   and leverage in the gold market. So, when the \nDXY eventually rises as debts are refinanced   sometime in 2026, gold's price will likely fall, \ncausing speculative capital to flee and triggering   liquidations, pushing prices down even more. Meanwhile, crypto prices are also likely to fall,   not because gold is falling, but because the \nliquidity drain caused by debt refinancing is   creating a riskoff environment that's pushing down \ngold's price due to risk on investors getting out   of gold. Once again, this highlights the fact that \nit's not gold which drives crypto prices. It's the   risk off or risk on environment that gold's price \nis signaling based on its demand drivers. When   most of the demand for gold is coming from risk \noff investors, gold's price will rise while crypto   falls. But when most of the demand is coming from \nrisk on investors, as is the case now, gold's   price will fall while crypto's price falls as \nwell. I'll quickly note that the debasement trade   narrative is yet more evidence that speculative \nflows are in command of the price of gold and   precious metals at this stage. The silver lining \nis that even though the price of everything will   fall when liquidity contracts, gold's price should \nfall less than other assets in percentage terms as   risk off investors increase their allocation to \ngold during the drawdown. The golden lining pun   very much intended is that every liquidity drain \ndue to debt refinancing results in a liquidity   injection to help with this debt refinancing which \nthen restarts the cycle. Now to quickly recap,   the reason why speculative capital has been \nthe primary demand driver for gold recently   is because this is what happens at the end of \nevery liquidity cycle. When liquidity peaks,   commodities rally. What comes next is a liquidity \ncontraction that causes asset prices to fall. The golden lining though is that the liquidity \ncontraction will result in a liquidity injection   which will cause asset prices to rise. So this \njust leaves two questions unanswered. The first   is why crypto didn't rally alongside gold in late \n2025 as it did in previous cycles. And the second   is what comes next for the crypto market given \neverything we've just discussed. The answer to the   first question is something that not enough people \nare talking about. And that's that there was a   disconnect between crypto and liquidity sometime \nin the summer of 2025. For those unfamiliar,   crypto is highly correlated to global liquidity, \nand prices lag liquidity by around 3 months."

The answer to the first question is something that not enough people are talking about. And that's that there was a disconnect between crypto and liquidity sometime in the summer of 2025. For those unfamiliar, crypto is highly correlated to global liquidity, and prices lag liquidity by around 3 months. As   you can see, global liquidity kept rising into \nthe autumn of 2025, but BTC and the rest of the   crypto market chopped sideways. Literally, every \nother major asset class hit new all-time highs   except crypto. US stocks, foreign stocks, precious \nmetals, other commodities, the list goes on. Now,   many have claimed that this disconnect between \ncrypto and global liquidity was caused by the   refill of the Treasury General account over the \nsummer, but this doesn't make sense because the   disconnect between crypto and global liquidity \nbegan weeks before the TGA started being refilled. And not only that, but the 3month lag means that \nthe cause of the disconnect likely happened in   the spring of 2025. Now, our best guess is \nthat something in the crypto market broke   in the spring of 2025 when the markets crashed in \nresponse to Trump's liberation day tariffs. Again,   many have claimed that the breakage happened \nwith the 10th of October liquidations. But the   reason why those liquidations were so brutal was \nprecisely because liquidity in the crypto market   was already abnormally low heading into the event. This pertains to the answer to the second question   which you'll recall is what comes next for the \ncrypto market given that the next draw down in   gold may not result in a rotation into crypto. The answer is a bit complicated. You see as   illuminating as the liquidity models from Michael \nHowell and others are they don't factor in   injections of liquidity which were unexpected like \nfor instance lastminute stimulus. As most of you   will know, the Fed started buying US bonds at the \nstart of December 2025, which it insists is not   quantitative easing. Despite what the Fed insists \nthough, this does amount to a liquidity injection   and the draw down of the Treasury General account \nsince November is another tailwind for liquidity. When you remember that crypto lags liquidity by \n3 months, you understand there could be a small   rally sometime in Q1 2026. And when you combine \nthis increase in liquidity with the potential   approval of the Clarity Act, it means that \nattention and capital could rotate into the crypto   market. The approval of the Genius Act in 2025 was \nessentially the only bullish crypto catalyst that   caused prices to rise. With a bit of luck, we'll \nsee history repeat with the Clarity Act having   a positive effect on crypto prices. After that \nsmall rally though, the crypto market is likely   to fall as liquidity is drained due to the debt \nrefinancing wall, which I'll remind you can be   tracked by looking at what the DXY is doing. The \nmore the DXY rises, the closer we're getting to   that debt refinancing wall and the subsequent \nliquidity drain. And I'll repeat that this   liquidity drain will eventually be followed by a \nliquidity injection to help with the refinancing. The only problem is that this liquidity injection \nprobably won't happen until the markets or the   economy deteriorate to the point that policymakers \nstart to panic. That's exactly why things like QE   have historically corresponded to market crashes \nand bottoms rather than rallies or tops. The Fed   only steps in with extensive stimulus when things \nlook very bad. So, be sure to keep that in mind   in 2026. And yes, once that emergency stimulus is \nannounced, expect to see crypto prices start to   recover around 3 months later. And yes, gold will \nprobably bottom around the same time the crypto   will, just like it did in 2018 and 2022. Then the \nliquidity cycle will start over again with stocks   and crypto leading the way as liquidity expands \nand a rally in commodities marking the peak in   liquidity just like it seems to be now. The wheel \nkeeps on turning."
