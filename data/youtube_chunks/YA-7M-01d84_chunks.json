      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse. Today we're going to talk about the crypto ghost town and discuss why retail investors are notably absent from this cycle. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and check out Into the Cryptoverse Premium at into the cryptoverse.com. on into the cryptoverse premium. We provide a lot more updates and we go through a lot more charts, a lot more assets. So, make sure you guys check that out. And as I said previously, we have also launched a new website, benjaminc.com. If you guys want to check that out, uh you can you can do so, especially if you're wanting to reach out for any type of inquiries or anything like that. Let's go ahead and talk about the ghost town that crypto has become, why it has become like this and what we can ultimately do to try and fix it. Okay, this kind of started I mean we've been talking about this for years, right? We've done so many videos on the social risk over the last few years. And if you're not familiar with the social risk, it's a chart that looks like this, where you have the price of Bitcoin, this blue line, but then you have this orange line that shows you the social interest in crypto. And if it feels like this cycle was different, it's because in many ways it was. Now, in many ways it wasn't. Bitcoin found a top in Q4, the post having year, which is when it normally finds a top. But there also wasn't a lot of interest, right? Like you could argue that this entire cycle was more institutional driven. It was not really driven by retail investors. As you can see, the interest for retail investors has just continued to drop really since May of 2021. It never started putting in higher highs since then. Now, recently there's been a lot of discussions on X or formerly Twitter about the algorithm and some people suspecting that it's the algorithm's fault. Now, I cannot speak to the specifics of the algorithm on X, but you should know that lower interest in crypto is not just something that is happening on X or formerly Twitter. It's happening across the board. And we can show this, right? I mean, we've we've talked about this many times. If you look at YouTube views to various crypto YouTube channels, you can see that we never actually started to recover since 2021, right? Like 2021 in the summer, we kind of put in a high after that first top. And social interest in crypto has actually been dropping, right? It's not actually been going up in terms of retail. The reason arguably that we continue to see Bitcoin go up was because all of the institutional interest and of course ETFs and whatnot. But most altcoins are actually closer to their 2022 lows than their 2021 highs. In fact, if you look at the valuation of altcoins against something like silver, which has been going parabolic, altcoins are actually at a lower valuation now than they were in late 2022. So, one of the reasons it's a ghost town is just simply because the price action has been awful. That's the reason. You don't really need further reasons beyond that. While a lot of people might like to pretend like they are in it for the tech, you quickly know that's not true because whenever price action starts to go down, whenever price action doesn't continue to just go up parabolically, people just disappear. So, we can go ahead and do away with the illusion that everyone's here in it for the tech. We absolutely know that's not true because when you have prices dropping for a few years, you can see that retail interest has mostly dried up. In fact, this is a 7-day moving average. If we change it to like a 50-day moving average, it makes it a little bit clearer and that you can see now we're actually only averaging a little over 500,000 views a day when looking at a 50-day moving average. Now, compare that to 2021 when we were averaging almost 2 to three million views a day, these different crypto YouTube channels. So, social interest now is probably like 16 of where it was in 2021. That is why no one like that is why price action has never recovered. Now, of course, it's the chicken and the egg, right? Do prices go down because people aren't here to buy or do because there's no social interest or do social interests go down because prices are going down, right?"

Do prices go down because people aren't here to buy or do because there's no social interest or do social interests go down because prices are going down, right? So, you could argue, you know, which comes first. But it is important to recognize that what you're seeing is not just an um a very a platform specific thing. Like you're also seeing the same thing on YouTube as viewership to these different crypto YouTube channels has just been dropping, right? It's just been dropping. Um and and really just the last few months you can see that it's been dropping considerably and it hasn't really slowed down just yet. Which is one of the reasons why while you can have counter trend rallies in the market, it's one of the reasons why I I still lean more bearish than bullish going into the summer of 2026 is because yes, you can have these rallies like back up to say like the bull market support ban or the 50we moving average. You can have those, but you're still seeing people just kind of disappear, right? Like the interest is leaving rather than coming. Now, you could of course argue, well, you should bet against the crowd. Like, if no one cares, then maybe that would be a reason that price should go up. Well, that could be true, but it doesn't mean that the first part of 2026 won't just inevitably be kind of bearish like most first halves of midterm years are, right? You could argue that betting against the crowd makes sense, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be rewarded with new highs in the next month. it could take until you know next cycle before something like that happens. So I'm not saying that idea is inherently wrong but we also have a problem. The social interest has just been generally trending down. And so in terms of retail interest, there's just been this narrowing narrowing pool of capital to kind of keep those prices elevated. is one of the reasons why Bitcoin did well, but most everything else just bled against Bitcoin because there wasn't a lot of new capital coming into the market outside of the ETFs and and the institutional interest that was mostly geared towards Bitcoin. This shows viewership to these YouTube channels. If you look at subscribers and we look at a 30-day moving average of subscribers to these YouTube channels, you can see that on average, these YouTube channels are losing subscribers on average. So, this looks nothing like 2021. In 2021, these channels were averaging around 50,000 new subscribers a day. Now, they're averaging a loss of about 167 subscribers per day. So there's a really there's a big difference between, you know, what was going on back then and what is going on now. And one of the things to consider is when you look at the advanced decline index of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, you can see that's actually been trending down since 2021. So that is actually more in line with social interest than the actual price chart is. What this means is that the reason the total market cap of crypto went up was only because of a few assets. It was mostly because of Bitcoin, right? I mean, it was Bitcoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies that actually is still at an all-time high compared to the cycle before. Most cryptocurrencies have actually trended down all these years. A lot of the people that that that we remember the bull market in 2020 2021, it was when everything was going up, the advanced decline index of the top 100 cryptocurrencies was generally trending higher, meaning most things there was broad participation in the bull market. But the bull market we had from 2023 to 2025, there was little participation. It was more of a defensive strategy to people selling their alts and trading it for Bitcoin."

But the bull market we had from 2023 to 2025, there was little participation. It was more of a defensive strategy to people selling their alts and trading it for Bitcoin. and Bitcoin led the bull market and everyone thought there was going to be this rotation into alts and then there just never was. And so then people kick the can down the road and say, \"Well, the rotation will eventually happen.\" But again, that doesn't really help the fact that these altcoins have been bleeding against most everything for the last four to five years. How do we see this start to go up like we saw in 2020? How does that start to go up? Right? That's the question. And that is something that really hasn't happened yet. How does this go up in a sustained way? Now remember, it went up in early 2020 and then we still had a drop because Bitcoin dropped because we had the pandemic induced recession. So you can look at Twitter or X and say that it's because of the algorithm, but we also see it on YouTube as well. So I don't know that that's fair. In fact, we actually follow it on Twitter or X. To be honest, it's Twitter to me. Like, I don't I mean, it's just I think it's just always going to be Twitter. So, if you hear me call it Twitter, you can correct me, but I'm just going to keep calling it Twitter. Uh, if you look at new Twitter followers to various crypto um influencers on Twitter, you'll see that yeah, no one really cares, right? Like, these channels are averaging around 2 and a half thousand new followers per day. That might sound like a lot, but when you think about where it topped in 2021, these channels were averaging a 100,000 combined were averaging a 100,000 new followers a day. So you're talking about 150th of the interest basically, maybe a little bit more than that because it's 2 and a half thousand, but about 150th of the interest in terms of new followers on Twitter. You can also look at new followers to exchanges on Twitter and see that it's relatively low compared to what it was in 2019 or sorry 2021. And if you look at new followers to various layer 1's on Twitter, you'll see something very similar, right? Relatively low interest, especially compared to 2021. Right now, these layer 1's are averaging around 5 a half thousand new followers per day. But in 2021 at at the heights, they were averaging over a 100,000 new followers per day. So, it's a ghost town, right? Crypto is a ghost town and it's been a ghost town for a long time. It's just that Bitcoin has been able to hide the fact that it's a ghost town because Bitcoin's price has continued to go up while most everything else just bleeds back to it. I if if you look at at total three minusd divided by bitcoin like you can see that alts have been bleeding to bitcoin for many many years you can pretty clearly see it and and and this is the thing that I've tried to tell people for years that you know you were better off just sticking with bitcoin than than going into all these altcoins and now the argument that a lot of people have is that well like now they think that all season will happen after all these years because it didn't happen in 2023 2024 and 2025 therefore they think it must happen in 2026. But I want to show you something. The alt season of 2017 and the alt season of 2021, you can see where alts really significantly outperformed Bitcoin. They occurred after social interest had been trending up the entire year, right? Like social interest in crypto in 2017 was putting in higher lows and higher highs all year. And then the alt season happened um near the end of 2017."

And then the alt season happened um near the end of 2017. And in 2021 when we had that alt season there was a we saw if you look at the social interest you can see higher lows and higher highs in the social interest and then you had the alt season. The problem right now is that a lot of people maybe not a lot but there still are a few sort of louder influencers that are continuing to call for all season but none of the social interest actually verifies that. Like there's no increase in social interest right now. So, it's going to be hard to have any durable rally in altcoins until you actually see something like that happen like come back where retail is actually interested in crypto again. So, one of the reasons why it's a ghost town is because price action for a lot of the altcoins has been awful since 2021. Right? This was now five years ago because now it's 2026, right? talking about 5 years of people waiting for something that just has refused to happen. And so it is a ghost town not just because of algorithm changes but because price action has been abysmal. Now you could blame all sorts of things. Why has price action been abysmal? Because it it sort of just opens up the next question. Yes, of course if price is bad, people are going to leave. But then it it sort of raises the question, well, why is price action so bad? One of the reasons is because this cycle there has just been so many altcoins, right? I mean, that's one, it's not even the main reason, but one reason is that there were more altcoins printed, minted in a single day in 2025 than I believe from 2011 all the way to 2021. more in a single day when the pool of liquidity is shrinking in terms of retail because remember retail investors are the primary ones buying altcoins. Institutions are primarily sticking with Bitcoin. When the pool of liquidity that goes into altcoins is dropping while the number of altcoins being minted is going up exponentially. It just means that the liquidity that was going to go into the altcoin market, it just gets spread thinner and thinner and thinner. A lot of people thought that Bitcoin dominance would collapse the entire cycle because of all the new altcoins. But as I said before, just because you meant more altcoins doesn't mean there's more liquidity for those altcoins. You're just taking the existing liquidity and spreading it thinner and thinner and thinner so that every individual altcoin gets less of a rally, right? Like less of a move up before they eventually just go asmtoically to zero, which is what 99.99999% of the altcoin market does anyways. That's one reason. The other reason is that 99.999999% of these tokens that have been mented are just outright scams. That is the truth. They are scams. They only exist to make the founder rich. Right? The founder what they do is they mint a memecoin. They pay influencers to shill it. Okay? Those influencers get allocations in those meme coins for shilling it. They then dump on their followers. The followers get mad and then a few months later the influencer does it again and again and again and again and again. This has been going on for years. How many years do you think this can go on for before the followers of those influencers start to realize what's happening? Then they realize, oh, this is a scam. you know, when Gary Gensler left the SEC back in early 2025 and everyone thought it was like a great thing for the altcoin market. In reality, it ended up just opening the doors for a ton of people just to launch whatever memecoin garbage they wanted to launch."

In reality, it ended up just opening the doors for a ton of people just to launch whatever memecoin garbage they wanted to launch. And so, I'm a big believer if if the markets are not going to be regulated, which I actually prefer uh the way things are now, like I don't think they need to be securities, but if you're not going to regulate the markets, the markets will regulate themselves, which I'm a big believer in, and that's what's been happening. You don't have to declare memecoins as securities for them to eventually go, you know, like I think a lot of people were afraid that if they were declared securities, it would be really really bad. And then then they weren't declared that, which I actually prefer. I prefer that they they they're not securities. Um they thought it would be a really good thing. But the reality is it just opened the floodgates for everyone to just launch their own meme coins and then people are just like, you know what, let's just call a spade a spade and these are scams. Okay, so there's been so many things launched. How long do you expect to engage retail investors if everything launched is a scam, right? And the hard part is if you're a developer, and I imagine there's a few of you that are watching this video that are developers, and perhaps you were really interested in developing something in the cryptocurrency asset class in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, but the reality is the market never rewarded you for it. The market rewarded the meme coins for a while. all the money, all the excess liquidity that was not going into Bitcoin, that was in crypto, a lot of it went to memecoins. Now, if you're a Bitcoin maxi, you would just say everything is a meme coin except Bitcoin. But if you have some room for something beyond that, where there's Bitcoin and then there's memecoins and then there's something in between where people are trying to develop something, whether you believe it or not. I choose to believe that there are some people that want to to actually uh grow the industry in the right way. A lot of those people left because they were never rewarded, right? I mean, none of their projects took off. All the all the liquidity, there was this malinvestment of capital into garbage. Now, after all these years, the the asset class is finally starting to mature to the point where people are realizing, hey, maybe I shouldn't go buy the most recent memecoin scam that this influencer is shilling. Maybe I should remember this is the 17th time they've done this and I don't want to fall for it again. People are wising up. Like they're realizing what's happening and rather than stick around, they leave. Rather than sit to stick to Bitcoin, they leave because they're just so tired of the scams. So to some degree, people have left because price action has been awful. Price action has been awful because this entire cycle the crypto industry focused on what it shouldn't be focusing on. People went the wrong way. They did. That is the reality. The industry as a whole focused on things it shouldn't be focusing on rather than developing things. And I think we lost our way. So much this cycle has been focused on price. Like where's the price going to go? Oh, let's launch the ETFs because it's great for price. Oh, let's get a treasury, you know, um, you know, that the US has because it's good for price. But there hasn't been as much fundamental development in the industry. There has been some, and the most development I think that's happened in terms of just getting institutions on board has been focused on Bitcoin. I'm not saying there's been no development, but remember, Bitcoin is basically the one of the few things that actually had a bull market."

I'm not saying there's been no development, but remember, Bitcoin is basically the one of the few things that actually had a bull market. There was de there was good things that happened there, but everywhere else, what really happened, right? Not a lot. Not a lot. Now, could you blame the Fed? Could you say this is the Fed's fault that they kept interest rates so high? They had quantitative tightening going on for so long. Therefore, it's the Fed's fault because this is all this stuff, as I said before, happened in 2019 as well, right? You guys remember in 2019, Bitcoin topped out in in June, just a couple of months before the balance sheet of the Fed started to go back up. So if you were to overlay total assets held by the Federal Reserve, you can again see that, you know, it started to go up in in September, Bitcoin topped out a couple months before that. Just like this time, the the balance sheet started to go up in December, Bitcoin topped out a couple months before that. You see the similarities, right? like QT, QT, Bitcoin tops right before QTNS. In 2019, again, 2025, Bitcoin tops right before quantitative tightening ends. Same playbook. 2019, there was no rotation into altcoins. 2025, there was no rotation into altcoins. 2019, social interest went down and it started going down before the top. Just like this cycle, it started going down before the actual top. It came all the way back down and then eventually it started to trend back up, but it took a while. Now, you could blame the Fed and you could say, \"Well, if rates have been lower, if the money printers have been on, it would have been a different story.\" Maybe you're right. But there's a reality we have to talk about with crypto as well. And it's that if you want to blame the Fed for crypto's bad price action, then why are other things doing so well? Like the stock market continues to print new highs, gold continues to print new highs, silver continues to print new highs. So many things continue to go to new highs. The Dow Jones continues to go to new highs. So, can you really sit around and blame the Fed for bad price action when basically every other asset class that you might be mildly interested in went up and continues to put in new highs? Can you really blame the Fed? No. One of the things that I think we have to consider as it relates to crypto and especially when you want to make the comparison to stocks, a lot of stocks have value because they actually make money in some way. Like if you don't need to be a genius to realize that Apple makes money, right? Apple sells products and they make money. Google makes money. Meta makes money. Netflix makes money. Nvidia makes money. Amazon makes money. These companies make money. So, you know, when you buy them, there's some fundamental understanding of the fact that the company will continue to make money. When you buy an altcoin, that's not necessarily true. A lot of the altcoins are circular economies where people get yield, but they get yield by the tok the project just minting new tokens and diluting existing holders of the coin. So they think they're getting they think they're making money because they're earning say 5%. But the only reason they're making 5% is because the projects are minting tokens. Therefore, the the current hold that they have is just being diluted. Now, that's not necessarily true for every project, but I'm just trying to show you that these circular economies exist within the altcoin market, and that's not a sustainable business model. It's just not. It's great for dubious speculation when money and liquidity is just freely moving around, but it's not great when times are tough and liquidity isn't as rampant."

It's just not. It's great for dubious speculation when money and liquidity is just freely moving around, but it's not great when times are tough and liquidity isn't as rampant. When liquidity starts to shrink, investors become a little bit more concerned about their investments. They're not going to be as likely to go buy some random memecoin as they might go buy an index fund, right? Because they know if they buy an index fund, they're getting exposure to a lot of companies that are making money. If you buy an altcoin, are you getting exposure to something that's making money or are you getting exposure to a circular economy and the founder is going to rug it next Tuesday, right? What are you actually getting exposure to? So, you can't really blame the Fed. What you can say though is that perhaps for the asset class to mature as a whole, the industry needs to start focusing on projects that actually provide utility that provide something that can be seamlessly integrated into society. That doesn't necessarily exist just yet. Now, I'm not saying there's no forms of utility in crypto. What I'm saying is this. What form of utility in crypto does the average person use today that they don't even realize they're using? Not a lot, right? Not a lot. That is something that needs to be fixed in my opinion because if these projects were actually more profitable, right? if they're actually making money and the economies were not as circular. If there was this need by society for the product, then a lot of the altcoins that make those products would be at massively new highs, just like the stock market is. But most of those are not at new highs. Now, there are some, and there's even some today that are putting in new all-time highs, right? The privacy coins recently have been doing really, really well. But it's hard to know is that just the narrative of this part of the cycle is that narrative going to be be dead in a year, right? Because all the other narratives ended up dying a year or so after they were formed. So the crypto asset class, I think, is in a maturing phase. It's a ghost town because people are tired of being scammed. That is why. And if we as an industry can focus on what really matters in the industry and that's Bitcoin and also real utility, then and only then I think will the asset class truly start to realize its full potential. Until then, I think as far as altcoins go, they're just going to continue to struggle. And every year or so there's going to be a few that do well and it's gonna make people think that it's alt season but it's not. It's just a rotation of capital within the industry because you can see the retail interest has completely left in order to start seeing it trend up. There needs to be more utility. It can't just be oh the Fed has to come save us. That's my opinion. So, I think this been a hard cycle for sure. It absolutely is a ghost town. Times will get better would be my guess, but it could take a while, right? Like it it might take a year or two to start seeing the social interest really start to trend up again. I think it's going to take some time and and hopefully by that point the industry has more to show for itself and and as a whole investors can actually focus on what matters. I'm sure many of you got really annoyed just like I did when you would see people working on technologies and products that were kind of interesting and then someone famous would launch a memecoin and then all the liquidity would go into this memecoin and then we'd be we'd then get a 30% correction by the markets."

You know, can we reach the point where the industry rebukes people that keeps launching meme meme coins and says, you know what, we're not going to reward that. We're going to, in fact, ignore you. We're not going to give you the platform that you think you deserve. That is where we need to get. I think we're getting there. It's just taking a while. So, crypto is a ghost town. It's been a ghost town for a long time. The defensive posturing in crypto for the last few years has been led to has made people sell their altcoins for Bitcoin that allowed Bitcoin contributed to Bitcoin's bull market. Right now, you could argue that we kind of had this top on apathy and we're starting to go down just like 2019 with some lower highs and lower lows along the way. We are, of course, waiting for more liquidity. We're waiting for a turn in those macroeconomic conditions, I think, to start the next cycle. I think it's going to take some time, but in order to see more broader participation, I think it would be great if the asset class as a whole and the investors that participate in the asset class start to focus more on what matters and less on what doesn't.
