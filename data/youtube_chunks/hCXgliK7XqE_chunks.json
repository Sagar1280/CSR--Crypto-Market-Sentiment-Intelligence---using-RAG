      "text": "Bitcoin is in serious danger of revisiting this support low, this must hold level where we only have had one bounce. It's actually where support is established. While we've been close to this level and hitting it before, we haven't actually tagged it. We really don't want to see that. There's a lot of added stress right now with S&P futures being down before the day opens, or rather the US market opens on Tuesday because Monday was a holiday. Lots of stress around new tariffs and fears and concerns about Greenland [sighs and gasps] 2026, man. Already off to an amazing start, right? So, I'm going to explain why we have a make orb breakak scenario right now for BTC here on Coinb Trading. What's up? My name is Aaron Dishner from the Better Traders. You're watching Coin Bureau Trading. Slam that subscribe button, like this video, and let's get right into it. Now, the reason why this formation, this parallel channel moving up is so important is because this is a bare flag. The reason why this is a bare flag is because bare flags have a bearish outcome. And that's exactly what is still going to be the case. Whether Bitcoin goes up to 100, 100, 200, $400, $5,000, inevitably the price will go down. I know that there are a lot of moonboys out there that are talking about BTC going up to $250,000 or $300,000 this year. It's not very likely. I have other charts I'm going to share as to why I think that's not a likely outcome. [snorts] But first, the main thing you have to know about a bare flag is that it usually prints higher highs and higher lows. So, we've seen that. We've seen a higher high, higher low, higher high, higher low. Now, the scary thing right now is that BTC is very much being affected by S&P futures, which I'm going to get back to Bitcoin in a second, but we need to look at this over here. We're going to go to ES1. Now, this chart, the good news I will say about it is that we have a gap. You know that Nick on the main channel for Coin Bureau, he's always talking about gaps on X. You should give him a follow, by the way. But we do have a pretty clear gap right here. I have to kind of draw it out. So, our gap is up to 6960.5. So, right now, S&P futures continue to tumble lower. If we move this to an hourly time frame, it actually dropped lower yesterday night, my time. But the reality is that this is still not looking good. It's not looking concern or it's looking very concerning. It's not looking healthy at all. But here's the thing. We're used to seeing so many gap up moments for S&P or for the S&P or S&P futures, uh, like over here, which means that we need to see the price go back down to fill that gap. We've seen this happen time and time again. There's a gap up over the weekend. There's a gap up over the weekend. Uh, let me go back over here. There's another gap up basically. Yeah. And it hasn't actually been filled yet. There's another gap up. So these are very very very typical. Now I really don't want to see a gap down like this happen. Alth this kind of sort of filled but not really. I don't expect us to have another massive tariff crash like I think a lot of people are because the markets learned that well tariffs while they're painful and tariff years are bad, we already got flushed. We already got flushed and fleeced back over here in April 2025 and the market recovered after that. So, the good news that I'm focusing on for right now is that even though S&P futures is down, we have a bullish gap. Now, what does that mean for BTC? Well, the reality is that there's no real strong correlation between price action for the S&P or for BTC. Sometimes the S&P is pumping and Bitcoin does. Sometimes Bitcoin is dumping, S&P is pumping and vice versa. So, they're not necessarily 100% correlated. When one goes up, the other one has to follow. But we know that if we see very bullish outcome for S&P futures all of a sudden magically by Tuesday's opening then we should see a bullish response from Bitcoin. But if it doesn't the target to watch immediately today is $89,000 about $500 or so really on the nose it's 89,372."

If Bitcoin falls down to this level right here and it does not bounce from this level, we are not likely going up here to 1004K as I've been expecting and predicting. The rally is getting cut short. This does not invalidate anything that I've been warning you guys about. Literally since all the way back in August, I've been talking about the possibility of what the bottom year is going to be looking like. That's exactly what's going to unfold this year. There's still way more that I need to share with you, but before I do, I need to I need to draw your attention to the comments down below and also the pin comment in the description down there. You're going to see links to sign up for WEX, BYDI, and Tubbit. This is crucial. This is a fantastic time to trade. Shorting the markets, while they are risky, if we are expecting this to be a well, I'm expecting this to be a bottom year and prices to go lower. Yes, you can be stopped out of your positions and hold on to your cash or you can short the market as it goes down or actually use futures the way it's supposed to be used where you buy an asset and then you buy a short position on that. So in case the price goes down, you're actually hedging your long position. But anyway, there are exchange partners to check out down below. There's WEX, there's BYDI, and there's Tubbit. All these have some crazy kickbacks, whether it's depositing and holding funds on the exchanges or trading and generating volume and getting a kickback in that form. Plus, there are more deals on the Coin Bureau website. Hit the deals button. First thing to check out is the Coin Bureau Club. You want to join this club because Dan, my co-host, is posting some crazy alpha almost on a daily basis there, as well as Guy and Nick are chiming in on that Discord server. There are other exchanges, there are other decentralized exchanges and tools to check out, plus a 10% off coupon, too. our course, the better traders, 15 minutes to financial freedom, which seeks to teach you how to reduce the time you spend trading crypto to just 15 minutes a day. And it is possible. So, we're going to go back over here to talk about again, I I want to help you guys because I don't want to be super duper bearish. So, we've established that this is a bare flag. It has a bearish outcome. Now, if we get some sort of a bullish bounce, what we want to watch out for is this pattern. Note, we're getting higher lows and higher highs. We've made a retracement back down. It makes sense to see a higher high. We have immediate resistance right now. If all of a sudden we got some crazy god candle pump at $102,000, the likelihood of that happening though is slim. So maybe by the first week of February, we might get up to $103,000, which if you watched my last video, this is basically the target I've been expecting for a bearish reversal. Anyway, this is the top of the bull trap right here. Um, other things to consider as well is that overhead uh resistance on daily RSI has been accurately predicting and calling every single top so far. The next move that we get up accompanied by another rally will mean that RSI will be going up. It will most likely not even get anywhere close to there. It'll probably top out maybe just above 70 and that will be it. But understand that my conviction is still down. It's a bottom year. We're going lower. Um the other thing that's um positive."

Okay, so we know that the S&P futures chart could bounce. There is always that potential. But what else is telling us that things might actually turn around to our benefit? Well, that would be gold. And one thing to note about gold is actually twofold. For starters, gold actually has a gap right here, which is wild. So we have our Friday close and then we have our Monday open and we have a gap that is right at let me give you the exact pico price 4620.975 gold is pumping now because gold is pumping we know that something is wrong or broken in the world obviously friction with tariffs and greenland and all that stuff is causing people to choose gold as a flight to safety but I need you to understand a couple of things while RSI has been making a big move up higher higher. I need you to understand that there is very little chance of it making a newer high above 93.12, especially on the daily time frame. On the weekly time frame, weekly RSI has been in a steady downtrend. There is not a lot of reason for this to keep going up higher and higher in my opinion. So, yes, I love seeing gold going up higher just like a lot of you do. I'm sure Peter Schiff does as well, but we have a lower gap. So again, I'm expecting that to be filled, which should correlate with a bounce on the S&P. Even so, I'm going to share something with you that you're not going to like, and I need to preface it over here with the totally S chart on the weekly time frame. So, for all of you guys that have been subscribed for a long time, you know that I share a lot of extra stuff. And one of those extra stuff kind of things are TBT divergence, which is from the Better Traders Club. This is from the Better Traders business. These are bearish reversal signals or bullish reversal signals letting us know about potential bottoms and potential tops, whether it's short-term or it's the pico top. Back over here, the week of October 6, we got a TBT bearish divergence cluster. That yellow tab right there, see that? It marked the top for Bitcoin. Just like back over here, it marked the top for Bitcoin. Did Bitcoin go up higher over here in November? It did. Marginally higher, but was at the top. It was the top and it was done. So, we got one of these symbols here. You might be thinking, \"Oh, well, we're going to get another leg up higher.\" We could. It's true. But signs, it doesn't [laughter] doesn't change the fact even if it went up a little bit higher. Where do we still go? We still went lower. So, I still think that that was the top for BTC and that we're going to be heading lower. This is a pretty amazing call. Bitcoin also had one of these as well on the weekly time frame. We didn't get a cluster, but we got one of these saying bearish reversal incoming and it marked it here on the 6th. Why am I showing you this? Well, here's why. If we go to the S&P chart, we have a a little bit of a problem. We have three of these TBT bearish divergence clusters on the weekly time frame for the S&P chart. The last couple times that we've got these, like back over here in November, it still took 14 weeks for there to be some sort of bearish reversal. It's not going to happen right away. In fact, it actually moved up a little bit more, but we did have a bearish reversal."

In fact, it actually moved up a little bit more, but we did have a bearish reversal. Back over here, our first one that we got was on September 21st, 2021, and the S&P rallied up another 7%. Huzzah. And we get a second one, and that marks the top in January 2022. And then we saw a bare market where the S&P fell 27% and it fell down to about $3,500 losing like that's that's a pretty rough move. Now we're at a position where we're seeing three of these together in a tight group. Now the third one was confirmed last week. S&P futures, by the way, also has this too on the weekly. The other thing I need you to know is that yeah, I think no, I'll save that one for Friday's video. You guys just have to subscribe and you'll see what I'm talking about. I need to leave something for Friday. So, what does this mean for right now? For right now, I still believe that Bitcoin has a valid bull trap setup, which is a bare flag with a potential top around $102,000. But if things do not resolve quickly, if the S&P does not gap up and we don't get some sort of reversal relief here for BTC, then I think we're in trouble and we're going to go a lot lower. Note, Bitcoin does not have to go up here to overhead resistance. It does not have to hit these exact levels. $100,000 is still going to be decent resistance for BTC. Do not be fooled. Just because I'm saying these big prices with specific numbers, just understand when we start getting another rally, we're going to feel it. And don't be afraid to go, okay, I'm gonna exit some of my positions here, and it's starting to feel a little bit hot, a little bit overheated. Now, I've already laid out the game plan of what I think is going to be happening this year. You need to watch this video again. Some of you that have skipped it and you just decide, \"Oh, I'm just going to click off.\" You are missing out. I am not trying to be a doomer and gloomer. I'm trying to be a realist because if we are heading into a bottom year, which I firmly believe, wouldn't you want to at least be a little bit prepared to know how to handle this year? Watch this video next. It will help you. And until the next time, you know what to do. Stay awesome and stay in the green. Peace."
