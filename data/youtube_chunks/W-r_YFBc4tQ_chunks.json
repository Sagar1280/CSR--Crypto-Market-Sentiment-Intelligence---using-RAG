      "text": "Yes, Banter fam. What's happening, guys? CPI day. CPI day. We need some volatility. I'm starting to get a little bit snoozy in the market. A little bit boring, right? Um, we do know CPI brings volatility. We do know CPI can be really good for Bitcoin dominance. Today, I want to prepare you guys chartwise. Market is just slowly grinding up, right? Bitcoin is still holding the good support we've been wanting to hold. We are getting closer and closer to lows being in and to us to really start rampaging to the upside. We've seen that strength is moving to altcoins. We're now just waiting for the damn pop. And today ultimately, I want to prepare for volatility. I do want to go through some trades off of the volatility as well. Um, but this could be a catalyst to get the market moving. Again, it's boring. It's newsfest. Yes. Yes. Yes. But that is when the market's going to pop at any point, right? That's when a big move is going to catch many off of guard. So, what we're looking for here yet again is above $94,000. We do have a short squeeze to $108,000, right? So, there is one really starting to coil up. Okay. And what we're looking for today is some nice strong volatility. Then what I also want to speak about is I want to speak about trading a little bit of stocks, right? Market's obviously getting a little bit snoozy for now. when it wakes up uh uh we'll be back in action but ultimately I look at stocks and I look at silver and I look at everything it's just going absolutely crazy and I see an opportunity with copper I see an opportunity with micro strategy I see opportunity with a bunch of different stocks and I think it's also important that if this market starts to just get a bit boring we kind of continue making money and moving to where the market's at so I want to go through a couple of strategies of two or three alcoins that I've bought a lot of yesterday in spot I want to speak about three new bots we've opened today. Um, and I want to speak about trades and volatility coming from CPI. Let's make sure that we are ready with our short squeeze levels and we know what to do when the market brings the volatility. So guys, day by day, we keep showing up, we keep going until we get to our success, the moist time. Let's go. I try and help everyone [music] in my space and this is what I get. I try and fight the butam fam fam. What up? How are we all doing? Hit the like, hit the subscribe button, get it up through the roof. Remember, I bought another five Bitcon Bitfunner packages I'm going to give you guys today. So like the video up, more likes, more Bitfunders that I give away. So to start off the show, I just want to release and show you guys we have opened three new bots, right? We've started to grow the bot portfolio. 2x leverage longs with stop- losses at 33% risk. I don't want to fight for long-term. I want to have a nice strategic stop-loss in play. And if this market wants to chop, you can already start to see that we make money on the grid profits, right? You could see here, okay, chop. I want to make money, right? I'm already 2% up on the investments just from the market going volatile, right? And then obviously 8% up from the initial entry on pump fund. Okay? But nonetheless, if you want to chop, I want to keep making money. I don't want to get in and out this whole time. I want a strategy that keeps me in the game, keeps me automated, right? and make sure that again no liquidations very very very important. So we've added a few to the list over here. So what we are sitting with now remember right below of the show you will find pionex link to find all the bots that I've set. You click on any of these a Cardano bot Avac bot ETH bot. You can see we are starting to build them up over here. You will then be able to use that direct bot use the settings. It will create a bot of your own but use the same settings. So the three we have added is a near protocol, a algo bot and a sooie bot for me. Continue to build the ecosystem."

So the three we have added is a near protocol, a algo bot and a sooie bot for me. Continue to build the ecosystem. Continue to build from Bitcoin is large caps and we'll get to the point of the altis and caps right the smaller smaller smaller tokens. They're not showing too much strength right now other than memecoins. Meme coins are showing some strength are showing some volume and that's why for me I'm quite interested in Salana at this point right and obviously ETH also looking pretty strong too I actually saw interesting chart to see that soul's actually breaking a quite a key trend here to ETH right so zooming out here I was looking at this trend right Salana is starting oh this is still up okay Salana still uh is starting to break out to ETH right and this trend all the way from June 2025 Right. So, just showing here that soul is also really starting to just pick up some momentum, right? And remember, it starts off slow, but then really starts to speed up at some point very, very, very quick to the upside. So, this is a key thing to pay attention to. So, the bots that we now have, I'll show you guys why we opened up these bots and why we're paying attention to these bots. Right, we do now have a near bot. Where are they? Over here. Why don't I see them? M, what am I up? Okay, I'm 5% up on my bot portfolio. That's not bad. So, put in $4,000 and up 5%. The market's kind of doing nothing. So, that that that's good. Make some money while the market wants to chop around. We do have three new bots there. You will find the links below. Okay, guys. Now, oh, one more thing. Join club. We are getting ready to launch, okay?

We have the expectations for today. A 0.3% below is bullish, above is bearish. Right now again I don't think this is going to make a bull or bare market but I do think it can bring the volatility that we need to break a certain area that will then start bringing momentum to the market right it's kind of snoozing off snoozing off a lot at this point so for me CPI has been you know CPI today PPI tomorrow between these two periods they bring enough volatility and we just need to break a wall when we break a wall the market will start accelerating to that right so if we look here again and we we we go to the Bitcoin chart. Okay, we pay attention."

Okay, we pay attention. We can kind of see here just on this chart alone, we are sitting with this short-term wall we at right now. Okay, the next wall is then at 95 and the next one above that is then into the 100,000. All right, so there's this wall and this wall. This one will really start getting the market start to wake up. Okay, else will probably start breaking some very key trends, start pushing to the upside, start bringing a bit of excitement back to crypto, right? And when you obviously look and you zoom out, you could see that the bottom big areas you want to pay attention to here. Let me just get this trending correct. There we go. Is we are sitting with this wall to the downside. So if we just make it simple, we are sitting between these two walls and that's why the market's got a little bit of a snoozefest. But once we break one of these walls, big moves start happening. Big volatility starts happening. Right? So for me, these CPIs, they bring volatility. And what I'd like to see, okay, is for us to eventually start cracking through this 94 95,000. You will see the moment we break through this properly, guys, we're going to go into a bull trend. At any point, the pullbacks are going to get a lot smaller. The downside, though, let's speak about things not going bullish, right? Is us losing this 90 89$90,000 zone. Then we could really start to see us into the 70,000s. And why I told you that I'm not afraid of this is just risk-to-reward. If I enter here, I protect myself here and we going here is my win bigger than my loss. Right? That's all you can do as a trader and all you do is as an investor make your wins way stronger than your losses. Therefore, losses, two, three of them, four of them, five of them is worth one win. Right? So CPI is very likely going to bring this volatility. I do think we are going to dump on CPI and I think after a few hours we are actually going to pump right this is what I am seeing within the trend I'm seeing short time frame looking exhausted okay so does that mean we come out expected probably right we probably come out expected market doesn't react too well to it short-term drop hour or two later markets start to open up we start to then get some some some in and then uh after a few hours I start to see upside so what we tend to is the Vshapes. So, I'm going to be opening trades, not now on the V-shaped drop, right? Is what I'm paying attention to. So, what I see happening, okay, is us pushing up into CPI, get someone excited, get people excited. I then see drop up D. That's what I see, right? So, I'm paying attention for buys here, right now. Now, if we end up becoming lower, still very likely we drop, right? It's crazy when the numbers are better. We've seen this a few times. Market has reacted to the downside which is crazy. Okay. But ultimately if we go bull I would like to see push up trap and then that would be entries over there for me. I am making sure I don't miss this period over here. The key is to not lose money and to get stopped out too many times, but to make sure that when you really see the clear pattern and really see the trade that you're looking for, right, is to get it before we have the short squeezes, right? High time frame market's telling me at any point next few weeks, we are ready to go up again, right?"

High time frame market's telling me at any point next few weeks, we are ready to go up again, right? Um, but I don't want to get chopped. The market is quite volatile over here. So, for me, this is not a point of entry, okay? It's either here and then we go. And that's what I want to pay attention to. Okay. And again, these Vshapes, what tend to happen is we drop higher, trap, go. So, this would be a point of entry. This would be a point of entry for trades that I'm looking for. Right. When it comes to the Bitcoin dominance, that is what I'm seeing. I'm seeing trap up and then I'm seeing altcoins be released once the volatility period is finished. right strength and again with altcoins I'm seeing this I'm actually seeing a little bit lower than yesterday right where we made I'm seeing that I'm seeing a push up a drop okay because what I've realized with these events is they do bring strength but they don't always bring it straight away even if we have a better number the market likes to dump off right which is quite crazy Matty you can start choosing some winners from bf funed there brother when we see and you see some great comments there bring them up um and we we give away uh some of the bitfunded on a very snoozy week at this point. Um, a couple of tokens to pay attention to. This is what I see something from Pepe. I'm not buying it now at all, but a push up and a drop to these periods. I do see that this is starting to break trend. It's on the other side of a very important trend and a token that I'm looking for for some trades. Right? When we look at SUI, that's what I see, right? Drop off, buy up. And to be honest guys, we don't have to risk buying this. We can wait for this. Let it drop. Let it push up. Let it go. If for me to buy here, I would need to zoom in, see the drop, track the trend, and catch the break. If we do so, then that is the entry that I'd be looking for. Right? If I miss that, let it break, let it drop, and that is where I am getting ready to buy. Remember, after that, I'm seeing short squeezes of up to 10, 20, 30%. Just need to get through this patch. What changes that theory though is us losing. Then you'll see a red tile tomorrow. We'll start working on some downside strategies. Then we're shorting to be honest. Then we're shorting galore, right? Short, short, short, short, short. Like, it doesn't matter. We go for where the money wants to go. Right now, we're still in supports. I got to be bullish. Um, as it stands with ETH, a drop off down to these areas of this 3,100, 3,80. That's a big zone for me. And then from there, again, buy zone here, a buy zone over here. Pump fund. Same thing. Push up, drop. That's what I'm seeing, right? Momentum, momentum. Yes, conviction as well. Very much conviction. Token that's really looking strong is Soul. And look at this big trend. all the way from the top. We're showing eyes again. I think there is that short-term trap. Market's probably going to maybe push before CPI a bit. Push up trap. But Soul, guys, if we break through and we come and test this on that that side of the line, I really think Soul is one of the best tokens right now for some trades. That's looking strong. Yes, Lambos. Lamb. One thing I promise you guys, I'm a little bit tired today. Kids didn't sleep too too much last night. It's a little bit exhausted, but I promise you specifically with myself, right? Highest net worth this year."

It's a little bit exhausted, but I promise you specifically with myself, right? Highest net worth this year. I don't care what the market does. Highest net worth, most successful trading year of my entire life will be this year. And I believe the same for many of you that lock in and just show up every day and push through. I I swear I'm checking at the end of the year. If I'm my highest net worth ever, my goal is to be financially retired by the end of the year. But it's not easy with this market chop. But it will happen, right? It will happen. It will happen. It will happen. So yes, convection and keep pushing through. Oh, and I will also be a good dad, good partner, good friend, and a good person, not just rich, right? Um, okay. That is the the number one goal. If I ever start losing that, I'll throw the money away, right? Money ain't worth my sanity and my soul, right? Ever. Um, okay. Let's go through. We have AVAC still in the big trends. One of the big tokens again. So, I'm seeing up drop go. All right, these are the strengths of what I'm seeing. I see this um lighter. Keep our eyes on it. I'm dollar costing. It's a token that I bought yesterday. Some more spots in a few hours, probably a day or two breakthrough. Keep eye for this breakout. Big trades incoming on lighter. Not ready yet, but keep eyes on that. Um we do have fetch also in big zones. Drop up. Go go go go go. Right. Market for me is looking strong. We have uh um not looking strong but looking definitely more bullish than bearish. Defin I don't see many bare plays right now. Volume is so so so low. It's crazy. Um so again, same thing. I'll go drop push go go go go to the upside over there. And guys I want to speak around. Remember BTCC we have a bunch of specials here link below in the description. Show you guys. Reason why I'm saying BTCC is for me, I'm really starting to pay attention to some stocks, right? I look at Micro Strategy chart and I'm like, \"Oh, this is this is quite nice, right? Risk-to-reward.\" So, I'm waiting for markets to open, but look at that. Look at that drop. Look where we are now. I can trade with USDT, right? And I can trade my normal leverage. I can just trade stocks. So, I'm really starting to, first time in my life, can get registrated some stocks, right? Um so here like Michael Austral's example buy here stop loss here and get ready for for uh the push risk reward is really good. Um but if I just look at this and I just want us to spend a little bit of time here quickly on stocks right is to just look at where is let me just show you guys here tokenized stocks commodity is just to look at their performance right we are really starting to see some strength within a lot of these different tokens you know last 24 hours I'm seeing six seven eight% um over the last thing like I looked at silver and it was quite crazy right I completely missed the But I was looking at copper. Looks like copper is really, really breaking the highs. But look at silver, guys. And crypto has been a little bit snoozy. That's what the silver charts done. Absolutely parabolic, right? Crazy. Now again, it all started when it broke these major previous highs, right? And I'm seeing copper being in the same positions over here, too. So again, if it's a bit snoozy when it comes to crypto, you can trade the stocks as well, tokenized stocks as well, right? That's where volatility is currently sitting."

So again, if it's a bit snoozy when it comes to crypto, you can trade the stocks as well, tokenized stocks as well, right? That's where volatility is currently sitting. Many tokens here that you can see that are starting to point nice and green, right? And just pay attention. You know what's crazy is they move a little bit less in percentage, but they follow the same things we've been learning for the last few years. the flags, the breaker trends, the the RSIs. Same technique, just trading a different category of tokens, right? But ultimately, same thing over here. So, if you're getting bored out there with crypto, you can trade stocks on the same crypto platform as well, which I do think is a big opportunity right now or while we are waiting for crypto. When the market goes bullish, bye-bye stocks. Crypto always, right? But at this point when crypto is boring and sideways and we're waiting for action and the stocks are moving, we can shift. We can move. So again, looking at numbers today, very likely we dip off after. That's the one I'm paying attention to. Let it bounce. If you if you're a little bit worried, let it bounce, get the retest, and that is where we build positions. Then guys, I will be back tomorrow. We'll do a full alcoin show. actually want. What did Dash do? Dash? Really? Are we starting this again? Is the dust coins waking up again? Are we serious? Oh my goodness. Okay. Well, Dash having a bull market for the day. Look at that. Wow, guys. Maybe go chart some old coins and put key trends in. Maybe starting to rotate again. Crazy. Look at us on Monero. You know, old old coins. Look at that. Can't dash around either, right? And look at Monero as well. Monero is starting to wake up soon. Nia's having a good wake up today. That's why we built some bots on it. Um but very very very interesting to see. Then tomorrow, let me know. Um can we give some bid funds, please, Maddie? Then tomorrow, let me know if you guys want to do I will basically do a live trading into rand show. So either tomorrow or Friday. What is to uh tomorrow, Thursday or Friday? I'm thinking this week to to just spend four hours together. We go from the show all the way to to Rand show. Let me know. I think it'll be fun. We can trade together, bit fund together, um leverage together, spot together, everything together. Let me know. Okay, Taylor Grove. Yes, but funed. Let's go. Next one. Whale. She says you're too long. Don't know how to take that, but uh you can have a bit funed. Sure. Okay, next one. Yes, Georgina Finch. Yes, a bit fun for you. Enjoy. Two more. Yes. Let's see. No, sir. What do you mean? Are you behind Liverpool or you mocking Liverpool? I think you're behind Liverpool. You can have a button. Next. One more. Love the show. Love the alpha. KJ, you get a bird final. Guys, I'll see you tomorrow. Let's get through CPI. Tomorrow's PPI. Um, and let's keep showing up day by day. Have a great day. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye. [music]"
