      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for dropping back into the heavy metalverse. Today we're going to talk about gold as it is now broken through 4800. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and check out ITC Premium at into the cryptoverse.com. We also, of course, have the new website as I've mentioned at Benjamin.com if you'd like to reach out there. Let's go ahead and jump in. So, gold has continued to put in new all-time highs and you know, one of the things we've said, one of the hardest things for do to do with for investors a lot of times just kind of hanging on for the bull market and not panicking all the way up. It's a very difficult thing for people to do, right? We know that. Now, there is something that has happened recently that I think is very important. And as I've said before, right, gold is sort of screaming that something else is going to be happening over in in risk assets. Now, what I mean by that, and a lot of people can appreciate what I'm going to say if you followed me for some of the crypto stuff over the last few years. Do you guys remember how for years we would say Bitcoin when it goes up, it'll break altcoins off of their support levels. And so then when Bitcoin goes down, the altcoins have nowhere to hide. Right? You guys remember we've said that. And you can see that Bitcoins or all alt valuations against Bitcoin have continued to climb throughout the years. And then whenever Bitcoin gets corrections, the altcoins just go to lower lows. Right? We've seen that happen. Now with gold, because of the extent of the current rally, it has now broken something else off of its support level against gold. And we just spoke about this yesterday or in the last couple of days. And it's the S&P 500 divided by gold. You can see that the current valuation is breaking down from these prior support levels. And you can even go back to the 1970s and see that this also was a fairly important support level back then as well. And that support level essentially corresponds to on the S&P valuation about 1.47 or so. 1.47 1.45 in that general ballpark. And you can even if you go back further and you look at at sort of the 1920s, you can see that this is this is the area that held resistance all the way back then. So one of the things that is happening right now and that kind of already happened in the crypto markets is that Bitcoin was able to mask the underlying weakness of the altcoins. And the reason it was able to do that was because when Bitcoin was going up, it was sort of lifting other things with it. And so at the time it"

And the reason it was able to do that was because when Bitcoin was going up, it was sort of lifting other things with it. And so at the time it felt like other things were going up. But in reality, I'll show you what Bitcoin was doing, right? Bitcoin was doing this. Okay? Whereas a lot of altcoins were doing something like this, right? So you think, right, you think that when Bitcoin is going up that it's it's like everything's included in it, but in reality, a lot of the altcoins are kind of like just kind of slowly going lower. But in the in the rally, it feels like they're going up. And some of them did, but a m a lot of them did not. Now you're starting to see the same thing play take place on other in other markets, right? So now it starts with crypto because crypto is further up the risk curve. Then it works its way down to sort of the next area and that would be equities against gold. And you can see that the stock market is starting to break down against gold. So one of the hard things about investing in, you know, in metals over the long term, especially when you're in bull markets like the one we're in now, is that a lot of people get sidelined, right? and they they sort of develop this mentality of like, oh, they'll just wait for it to drop and then it just keeps going up and then they eventually FOMO in and then it drops, right? That's kind of the story story as old as time, right? The I'll just buy it when it drops and then it just never drops where you want it to drop to. So, what happens is that you you get this sort of this like massive bull market by gold. And what happens is people then think there's going to be a rotation back into say riskier assets whenever the gold rally is done. I'm not saying there can't be a temporary relief rally in other markets when the gold rally is done, but it would be the same mistake that people made with Bitcoin and altcoins, right? Like a lot of people thought that when Bitcoin stopped rallying that there would be a rotation into alts, but in fact that's not what happened. And one of the reasons that's not what happened is because there just hasn't been as much interest in crypto for a lot of different reasons. Monetary policy is"

And one of the reasons that's not what happened is because there just hasn't been as much interest in crypto for a lot of different reasons. Monetary policy is one of them. Also, people in crypto just completely rugging their customers over and over again. That might have something to do with it. But that was what a lot of people missed is they thought there would be this rotation immediately into riskier assets despite the fact that last cycle there was not an immediate rotation, right? We hung out at the lows for a long time before there was rotation back. So, you could argue that a lot of people are are sort of buying other things than metals because they're waiting for the rotation, right? They're waiting for the rotation back and and so what they want to do is they don't want to they don't want to FOMO in into an asset that's been going higher, right? They don't want to FOMO in. So, what they end up doing is they end up buying other things that aren't going up. The problem is that if you look at the S&P 500 divided by gold and we zoom out and we say look at like a monthly chart. The problem is that if this breaks down which you can see the prior times where it's broken down from right every time it drops from the current level when there when when gold does eventually top there's not a a massive rally by stocks, right? Like that's the issue is that there's not always this math. Like if you look at at 1973 when when the S&P broke down against gold right here, gold continued to like gold got a short-term pullback and then it continued to rally for a while, then another pullback, and then it rallied again. You see that? And then there's the larger drop. But imagine how many people through here were like, \"All right, I'll just buy it when it dips.\" And then you have to wonder, did they even buy it in 1976 before it rallied again um into the early 80s. So imagine if you were watching gold in in the 1970s and you just said, you know what, I'm going to buy stocks instead of metals because the rally in metals has been going on for several years. The stock market during that time started to show weakness, right? So that that's like the issue is that those rotations are not always a sure thing, right? So when gold stopped"

The stock market during that time started to show weakness, right? So that that's like the issue is that those rotations are not always a sure thing, right? So when gold stopped rallying in 1970, well, I guess the first short-term drop was in 1973, precisely when stocks broke down against gold, right? There was a short-term drop. If you had if you thought there was going to be a rotation immediately off of that, you would have been wrong. What ended up happening is then stocks dropped a lot. They dropped a lot and then the stock market bottoms, right? The stock market ended up bottoming but not until a much later gold correction. And and so the issue is that like yes, there was an eventual rotation where stocks then rallied against gold, but it was after the stock market had had dropped a lot, right? It was like after like a 50% drop in the stock market. And so the the reason why investing is hard for a lot of people is because like they they want to sell their winners for the losers, right? They'll sell, you know, they they sold Bitcoin for altcoins. They'll sell gold to go buy some stock that's not doing anything. That's the biggest mistake that people make is they sell their winners to go buy losers. But the thing is is like the winners are winning for a reason and the losers are losing for a reason. And you should not have the confidence in my opinion. I don't have the confidence. You should not have the confidence that you can predict exactly when the trend is going to change. And what I've seen is there's there's a lot of confidence amongst a lot of people who completely missed the entire move by metals. Completely missed it the last couple years, but yet they feel so confident that they know exactly when risk assets are bottoming against gold or against silver. And they just keep looking at the chart and saying, \"Well, the parabolic rally can't last forever.\" Yeah, you're right. It's not going to last forever. But if history is any indication, whenever gold does get a correction, that doesn't mean there's an immediate rotation into risk assets. Usually when gold corrects into that drop, stocks are also dropping and then they might bottom out around the same time. And that's the issue is that like it's not I don't think it's going to play out like a lot of people think. If you look at the year-to- date ROI of"

Usually when gold corrects into that drop, stocks are also dropping and then they might bottom out around the same time. And that's the issue is that like it's not I don't think it's going to play out like a lot of people think. If you look at the year-to- date ROI of gold and you look at say 2026 and you compare it to 2022 and 2018 and 2014 and uh 2010 and so on and so forth, you can see that not all the years, but three out of the last four midterm years, gold found a low in Q3 or early Q4. Okay. So what's interesting about that is if gold were to find a low that it then builds off from let's say like August, September, October, November time frame, like somewhere in that time frame. What's interesting is that the stock market also tends to find a low around that time in midterm years, right? In midterm years, if you look at the S&P 500 and you look at 2026 and then you just simply compare it to the average of all prior midterm years, there's also a low then as well. So, what you could argue is that yes, we know metals will have a correction and maybe that low will end up being around Q3, but stocks and risk assets in general could also have a correction that ends up bottoming out around that same time. And the problem with that is if you're sort of betting on a rotation away from metals and into risk assets, the rotation might not happen until after gold and stocks and and crypto after all that stuff actually bottoms potentially like later on this year, especially something like crypto which is a little bit more cyclical uh than stocks arguably. So, this is like this current like the way to think about the market is people think like, \"Oh, I'll just wait for the I'll I'll trade it and then get into something else that hasn't rallied, but that other thing might just drop when the thing that's going up starts to drop.\" And so with with crypto, you know, if you look at like the advanced decline index of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, you'll notice that it's just been dropping since 2021. Meaning, a lot of the cryptocurrencies in the top 100 have just been going down rather than up. total market cap went up because Bitcoin went up. So, Bitcoin was able to mask the underlying weakness in altcoins. But now that Bitcoin has gone sideways for a year, the weakness in altcoins is completely undeniable by people now at this point. It was always deni it"

So, Bitcoin was able to mask the underlying weakness in altcoins. But now that Bitcoin has gone sideways for a year, the weakness in altcoins is completely undeniable by people now at this point. It was always deni it was always clear as day for anyone who was watching all Bitcoin pairs and Bitcoin dominance. But if you weren't watching that, if you were just watching like the USD valuations of altcoins and seeing they would rally whenever Bitcoin would, but then you would kind of forget that in the next rally a year later, the altcoin was rallying to the same price it had rallied to the prior year. Hadn't really made any progress, right? So, Bitcoin was able to mask the underlying weakness in altcoins. What you're seeing now is you're seeing the stock market at highs, which is a good thing. I own a lot of index funds, right? Like I'm not complaining, but the issue is that you could argue that some of the weakness by stocks might start to become more pronounced whenever gold gets a correction. And that hasn't happened yet, right? Because those weaknesses were more pronounced by the stock market when the stock market broke down against gold in 1973 and in 2008. Now, the reason why this is tricky is because there's no guarantee that this is where things break down. It certainly doesn't look that great right now because I mean it it looks like this is starting to break down here. Always possible that we get right back above it and we pretend like it never happened and we kick the can down the road another two or three years. But you have to watch this, right? Like you have to watch this. And so I I think that I understand like why it's difficult for people that don't own metals and then want to go buy them. But if you already own metals, like selling them for some risk asset isn't necessarily, in my opinion, not financial advice, but in my opinion, that's not all that doesn't necessarily make the most sense either. Um because like you're you're selling it for something that there is a good chance that whenever gold does correct, that's something you're selling it for could actually correct harder than gold. Okay? So again, we have to think about the rotations and whatnot that people are expecting. Does that actually backed up by history?

And historically, whenever gold does top, after the S&P breaks down against gold, the stock market, while it might found find some short-term balances, the stock market does tend to drop after that, you know, throughout that process. So, I just want people to be aware of that and not assume. I I just see I see like sort of a lot of other things floating around that like, oh, when metals top, that's when there's going to be this rotation into other things like risk assets, like crypto. But that's not necessarily what history suggests is the most likely outcome, right? Like the most likely outcome in my opinion is that risk assets might bottom around the same time that gold bottoms. But like gold hasn't even started going down yet. So it doesn't even make sense to start talking about a bottom for for metals when gold continues to put in new all-time highs day in and day out. Now, it is true that in mid-term years, gold often finds a top somewhere between like January and April kind of tends to be when the top occurs. So, that's why I I think that that metals will have a top in the first half of this year and then kind of drop into the second half of the year. But, those are my views on gold. And I know I sort of talked about some other things as well, but I just wanted to get that thought process out there because I do I think I've been seeing a lot of people kind of make the same mistake over and over again where they like sell, you know, they sell their gold for something else and that something else just keeps dropping and then gold keeps going up. The problem is that whenever gold corrects that thing they sold it for, good chance that also corrects and by the time that thing bottoms, it's also probably when gold is bottoming as well.
