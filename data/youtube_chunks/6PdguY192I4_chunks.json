      "text": "Yo, welcome everyone. Bitcoin is now trading above and breaking the big trend line resistance. That's why you should really get ready for the next move. Let me show you now. First, you're going to see we are right now getting almost a perfect bounce exactly at our volume area of support. Measuring right now the entire bottom price action with volume. what you're going to see value area low hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy and very very simply we got a rotation back towards the upside towards the value area high similarly as we have been doing for the past few days also for example right here the value area low hit the bottom volume level push towards the upside and a rotation back towards the value area high rejection another almost perfect bounce at the value area low another rotation back towards the upside and But of course also right now the exact same story bouncing at the volume level pushing back towards the upside. But also this specific area that was hit only a few hours ago. It was really not a random price target. Of course we can see value area high right here. And also right now Fibonacci retracement from our swing high back towards the swing low. It was the exact golden Fibonacci ratio but also right now going one step further zooming out on the 2-hourly. going right now with the anchored VWAP and anchor it exactly at this specific high. You are going to see Bitcoin definitely did not hit a random level only a few hours ago because of course it were three very important levels aligning exactly at $89,000 US area. So right now there is no doubt Bitcoin is definitely trading at an important area of resistance. Would I go with a brand new long trade right here? Definitely no. Because at the area of resistance, usually you much rather go with a short and not a long trade. At the moment, I do remain in my short trade on Bitcoin from approximately $90,000. Also, I do remain in my long trade on Bitcoin and also in the long trade on XRP. Right now, we are really at some kind of a decision point because remember yesterday we said if we are going to start breaking our local value area high right here, bullish indication of Bitcoin. And in this scenario, we can already look for much higher targets in the upcoming days. Now, let me do share with you more of a bullish scenario that I'm right now paying attention to in a case Bitcoin actually does get a push toward the upside. And this specific plan was made based on a higher term time frame based on the daily. First of all, of course, we write a no. Bitcoin is definitely breaking a major trend line area of resistance towards the upside. Yesterday we also got the first daily candle close above our major trend line. But also right now remember for the past few days we talked about a significant and a very important Elliot impulsive wave price structure. So we very simply identified that this right here was the first impulse. We got a correction. Another impulse right here. Another correction. And of course, if this specific alienate wave count right here is right or correct, we can still be expecting another push towards the downside for Bitcoin to then finally finish the entire fivewave price structure. But the reality right here is if for example we right to get another push towards the upside, Bitcoin starts maybe even going above $94,000 area, this specific alien wave count is probably going to get invalidated. Why so? Because of course in this scenario if we go right now first higher before going lower we need to then adjust our fourth ali wave. However there is right now a very simple rule usually we want to follow when we talk about our fivewave price structure. The fourth alien wave usually it takes longer to develop than the second wave. So what we can right do let's go with the Fibonacci time. We are going to measure the entire length of our second alit wave. And right now, of course, comparing the length of the second allit wave to the length of the fourth alit wave. And what you're right going to see if Bitcoin is going to start pushing even higher towards the upside, definitely we are already surpassing our 1:1 Fibonacci time, which is still of course okay because usually the fourth one takes longer than the second one."

However, if we right now first of all get another push towards the upside, the fourth all wave is going to be a very long one in comparison to our second all wave. We are of course already past our 2 to1 Fibonacci time level. And that is simply why if right now Bitcoin does get another push towards the upside, the likelihood of this being the proper fivewave price structure towards upside is actually going to be slightly lower. That is right why I would really appreciate for you to smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible. And of course also thank you for subscribing to the channel. right now. Let's also talk about more of a bullish scenario, we can be paying attention to in a case Bitcoin actually does get right now another push up. Now, of course, if we continue higher, we start breaking all of our major areas of resistances back towards the upside. In this scenario, this right here was not a fivewave price structure, but actually more of a three-wave price structure. So, what you're going to see some kind of an A B C move towards upside. And of course it really right now depends what is going to happen at the start of 2026. If Bitcoin does go higher definitely we can be looking for much higher targets at the start of 2026 which definitely is going to be something very very nice. However, if we are going to right now start going much lower in the upcoming days in this scenario, this specific fivewave price structure right here, it is still valid simply because the fourth all wave actually topped out just slightly after the one to one Fibonacci time. So, let's right now see what is going to happen in the upcoming days. But right now, Bitcoin is really at a significant decision point. Of course, we should always ask ourselves, how can we actually make money in the market? Should we right now be looking for another long trade or maybe is it better to actually fire a brand new short trade? Later in the video, I'm going to share with you a very nice trading setup with you where potentially not only you can be looking for a long trade but also for a brand new short trade. Now also let's right now very quickly go with Ethereum because right now we know Bitcoin is already breaking quite a significant trend line area of resistance towards the upside closing the first daily candle above it. But what about Ethereum? Is also Ethereum getting some kind of a bullish indication on a higher term time frame? What you're right are going to see. Let's connect our lower highs on the daily time frame where you're right are going to see not only Bitcoin also Ethereum is trying to break this specific trend line area of resistance literally straight towards the upside. We got some kind of a fake out already a few weeks ago right here. Similarly as also Bitcoin got literally a few days ago right here. So definitely right now Ethereum if you look like that it is also showing a sign of strength. However, we definitely need to know Ethereum is usually following Bitcoin. That is right now why I'm still right now having more of an open mind and potentially saying yes we can right now drop lower simply because at least at the moment we are not getting any major sign of strength. Sure our trend line area of resistance is getting a break towards the upside. However, our volume levels on Bitcoin are right now still acting as a major area of resistance. Yes, luckily for us on the 1 hour time frame, Bitcoin was able to get again a bullish cross with the exponential moving averages."

Yes, luckily for us on the 1 hour time frame, Bitcoin was able to get again a bullish cross with the exponential moving averages. Our 50 EMA is above the 200 EMA, which is right now indicating that yes, an average trend on the 1 hourly is towards the upside. However, on the 2-hourly, we are still in a downtrend. On the 4hourly, we are still in a downtrend. And that is right. for the next few days, you really should be still slightly more careful. However, if we do get a push towards some side, definitely I'm going to look to fire another major long or buy position because in this scenario, probably our fifth elite wave is then actually going to happen. Also, right now, let's go back on the 2-hour time frame where potentially we can be talking about some kind of an ascending channel. what we can do right here connecting our higher lows with a diagonal area of support expanding this one towards the upside. It does look like that Bitcoin of course if we right now go higher could be trading in some kind of an SN channel and the top of the SN channel right here is also not a random level. Let's right now also go with our high time frame areas of support and resistances where we can right now see the daily level coming in exactly at the top of our SN channel. Of course, only if Bitcoin is going to right now actually get another push towards the upside. Pay attention to Bitcoin literally for the next few days because the start of 2026 is going to be very very important. If we do then get acceptance above our volume levels, definitely a bullish sign, we are going to then look for much higher targets in the Q1 2026. And that is of course also why my trading bots right now are still performing very very nicely. Even if we are right now going to get another push towards downside, of course the trading bots, Bitcoin and Ethereum trading bot are going to be buying the dip. My Bitcoin trading bot is right to set up. So it is buying all the way down towards $65,000 area. The Ethereum trading bot is set up so it's buying all the way down towards $2,000 area. And definitely if we are going to get another push towards thumb side, not only that the bots are going to be buying. Personally, I'm going to add even more capital to both of those trading bots because simply I definitely want to be buying the deb.

You're going to have the exact Bitcoin and also the exact Ethereum trading bot. And definitely they are actually buying the dip. They are not scared if for example Bitcoin is right going to get another push towards side. Of course, also on the way up, they are taking the profits for you. Also, right now, remember what we were saying all yesterday, paying attention to the Bitcoin liquidation heat map on the oneweek time frame. Bitcoin unfortunately does have bigger liquidations exactly below the recent lows. And if Bitcoin does right to get another push down, a lot of people are going to get liquidated because exactly right here, we have almost 150 million of long trades getting liquidated. This right here right now is the biggest liquidation cluster on BTC."

This right here right now is the biggest liquidation cluster on BTC. And this is right here, unfortunately, of course, a bearish indication because this specific area is right now acting as some kind of a magnet for BTC. And this specific level, of course, if you remember from my yesterday's video, is not really a random level. If we go right now with our volume, definitely it is also going to be our value area low, but also of course if you look like that, it is still going to be some kind of a nice support level. Why so? Because exactly at our volume level right here, exactly at our liquidations cluster, Bitcoin does have the most important level as well, which is going to be liquidity level. What exactly do I have in mind here? You can right now see first liquidity level right here at $86,600. Another liquidity level just slightly lower. And then of course also another liquidity level just slightly lower. So definitely if we are going to go lower, very nice support level. But remember what we said yesterday. If you right now are looking for another long trade, sure you can be looking for a long trade exactly at our liquidity level. However, you need to pay attention to the reaction, don't just blindly long at this specific area. If the level is going to get hit first, we need to get a push down and only then a very nice reaction back above our value area low. If this is going to happen, sure, you can be looking for another long trade setting a stop loss below the recent low. And unfortunately if this specific value area low right here is not going to get reclaimed probably we are going to move much lower because in this scenario if there is going to be no reaction at our liquidity cluster right here definitely bitcoin is forming then a bigger 1 2 3 4 5 wave price structure straight towards upside also right now what about the money flow indicator on the daily time frame remember in our yesterday's video we talked about already the RSI on the daily but right now let's also go with money flow Because what you're right are going to see at least on the RSI indicator right now we are not getting anymore the hidden bearish diverent setup. Yes, I would definitely say the RSI is almost at the exact same level as it was only a few days ago. But the Bitcoin price is right now still forming quite a significant lower high. So one could already right now potentially say this indicator right now is potentially right now already forming some kind of a hidden bearish divergence. But also on the money flow what you're going to see a higher high here lower high on Bitcoin. Definitely if we are going to close money flows something like that in the next few hours it is going to be a confirmed hidden bearish divergence. So what we are right to see on the RSI and the money flow on the daily is a bearish Bitcoin indication. So right now again I don't know if we are going to go up or if we are going to go down. Personally with my trades right here I am prepared for both directions with the Bitcoin short and also then with Bitcoin long and XRP long position. But of course also I am definitely not going to get scared if Bitcoin this right here get under push down because my trading pots right here are actually going to be buying the dip. And of course if you want to use my exact training bots simply create an account on Pionex using this specific link. You register you deposit.
