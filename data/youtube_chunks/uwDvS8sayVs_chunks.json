      "text": "Bitcoin and crypto's big move is happening this week. In fact, it could happen in just two days. And right now is the time to get prepared for it. I hope that you guys all had a wonderful holiday and a happy new year. It's great to be back. And guys, boy oh boy, 26 just started off with a bang. And yeah, I've been away for a while, guys, but we're back full attack. 2026 is going to be a big year. [music] And the market is already flashing warning lights from every direction. Gold just hit 4,600, new all-time high. Silver tagged $84, new all-time high. Small cap stocks on the Russell just broke 2600 for the first time ever. And if you don't know why that's important for crypto, you guys will find out, and it's very important in a little bit. The Fed, our little buddy Jerome Pal, this is insane, just got served a Department of Justice subpoena. The Supreme Court has a tariff ruling window on January 14th and the Senate voting on the crypto market structure bill is on January 15th. This is the system shifting gears in real time and it's pointing to one message. Affordability and liquidity are the only stories that really matter this year. So in today's show, you're getting the full map. The policy lovers, the court dates, the Fed power struggle, and the onchain signals that tell you where the pressure is building. We're heading into midterm season and here the economy turns into a scoreboard. And that scoreboard, guys, is affordability. When the White House goes into midterm mode, the playbook gets very predictable. Lower the monthly pain, put more cash back in pockets, push borrowing costs down, make the average voter feel like they can finally [music] breathe again. Let me know in the comments, guys, how you feel right now. Can you breathe or you struggling? cuz you're not alone. Markets frontr run that playbook and crypto frontr runs markets. So if you want to make the most out of 2026, today's show is your playbook. This is the week that decides whether this whole story pumps on the fuel or slams on the brakes. So guys, without further ado, let's get into it. And again, remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. This week is the stress test. This is one of those stretches where inflation, housing, courts, and crypto regulation all collide and the market has to pick a direction fast. Tuesday, we got the CPI and new home sales. These are basically a double pulse check on inflation and demand. Wednesday, PPI lands, producer of price index, which is another read on inflation. But to top things off, we also got the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs. That's a big deal. Thursday, we got Philly Fed Manufacturing, which gives us a fast reality check on US growth momentum. It's one of the big days"

But to top things off, we also got the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs. That's a big deal. Thursday, we got Philly Fed Manufacturing, which gives us a fast reality check on US growth momentum. It's one of the big days where we've all been waiting for. The Senate Banking marks up the Clarity Act on January 15th. Then we move toward January 20th with the credit card interest rate cap deadline. This is the kind of week where price moves first and explanations show up later. If you're playing around with leverage, guys, as I've been saying for a while now, until we know directionally which way the market's moving, you better watch out. It's probably going to be a bumpy ride in the interm. I want you to all hold one thought while we go through the upcoming events. The biggest move might not come from CPI this time around. It might come from the courtroom because if tariffs get touched, the entire tariff dividend narrative changes shape immediately. But that's not the only thing that'll push the markets one way or the other. I got nine major events coming our way. So guys, let's start with the first wave. This is wave one. It's the affordability blitz. This is a big one. No, it's not stimulus exactly, but it will feel like it because President Trump says next year, including that means this year, will be the largest tax refund season of all time. Check this out. Under these cuts, many families will be saving between 11,000 and $20,000 a year. And next spring is projected to be the largest tax refund season of all time. That's a big claim. And if that happens, that'll be a lot of fresh capital rotating back to taxpayers. A lot of the provisions being discussed apply retroactively to 2025. And retroactive rules create a very specific setup. Your paycheck doesn't update itself in real time. Employers withhold based on outdated tables. So households overpay under the old math. This is what happened with 2025. Then settle up later under the new math. The nice thing, all that settlement shows up as one big lump sum. And that lump sum matters more than people think because it's going to hit everyone all at once and in a big way. What's everyone gonna do with their big rebate? pay down their credit cards, rent, groceries, car payments, and of course, what am I going to do with mine? Well, you guys know I'm going to buy some Bitcoin. What Americans are going to get hit with is finally some relief. So, when you"

Well, you guys know I'm going to buy some Bitcoin. What Americans are going to get hit with is finally some relief. So, when you hear the largest refund season, hear a liquidity wave that hits fast in a tight window, and markets love tight windows. Markets don't need everyone to act. Markets need enough people acting at the same time. That is how you get a wave that pushes risk assets. Now, the refund wave is one lever. The next lever is even more direct because it hits practically everyone's wallet immediately. Trump is pushing for the idea of capping credit card rates at 10% for at least 1 year with the deadline around January 20th. Let me guys think of this. I think this is great and I completely agree with Trump here. And who doesn't? I mean, everyone who's been paying insane credit card fees of 30%. But just check this out. >> Um, what happens if the credit card companies don't comply by the January 8th? >> Well, then they then they're in violation of the law. >> Very severe things. No, I want a cap on credit card interest rates because, you know, some of them are 28 almost 30%. >> And that people don't know they're paying 30%. The people out there, you know, they're working and they have no idea that they're paying 30%. No way. We're putting a one-year cap at 10%. And that's it. They know it. They really They've really abused the public. The credit card companies have totally abuse. I'm not going to let it happen. >> This is cash flow warfare because credit card interest is a problem plaguing millions of Americans. Actually, people all over the world. It's the charge that quietly eats away at every raise, every side hustle, every refund check. So if the monthly interest bill drops, more cash stays in everyone's pockets. If more cash stays in pockets, spending and savings stabilize. And if spending stabilizes, sentiment stabilizes. That is the chain. Now the important part is implementation. Banks, well, they respond to rules. That can show up as tighter approvals, smaller limits, and fewer people getting access at the margins. So, we treat this as a lever being pulled in the midterm mode. The markets trade the direction first, then the markets trade the second order effects, which we're yet to see, but those will show up soon. Now, let's add the third lever because this one touches the biggest affordability pressure point in America. So, next"

The markets trade the direction first, then the markets trade the second order effects, which we're yet to see, but those will show up soon. Now, let's add the third lever because this one touches the biggest affordability pressure point in America. So, next up, guys, let's talk about housing. The administration is pushing a $200 billion mortgage bond purchase plan. When you hear $200 billion mortgage bond purchase plan, think of it like this. Mortgage bonds are basically bundles of home loans that get sold to investors. When investors get nervous, they demand a bigger return to hold those bundles. And that extra return shows up as a wider spread, which pushes mortgage rates higher for normal people. So, the administration plan is trying to do something very specific. create a big consistent buyer for those mortgage bonds so investors don't demand as much extra return. That narrows the spread and can nudge mortgage rates down. And if monthly payments go down, that just might get the housing market to move again. Because housing, as you know, is the most expensive thing everyone has to pay for. Expensive is probably an understatement. Actually, I'm not sure what state y'all live in, but have you guys seen the prices lately? It is crazy. And if you guys know, I definitely recommend renting before buying. There will eventually likely be a housing collapse. And hopefully all of us make a ton of money, have some dry powder, and can buy a dream home when that happens. That is the time to buy real estate, not all-time highs. Housing is the affordability headline that never leaves. It's the payment people feel every single month. So, this is the theme again. Affordability, monthly pain, breathing room. Are you starting to get the picture of what the administration is pushing for? The next lever is the one people keep calling stimulus. This is the tariff dividend. At the same time, for now, it just remains as a proposal with moving parts. And that combination is exactly why markets trade it. So guys, let's dig into this tariff dividend because I know a lot of you guys are looking forward to it. The headline is simple. One-time $2,000 dividend check funded by tariff revenue. Here is the reality. This story has two tracks running at the same time. Track one is a political incentive. Midterms are coming. Cash in hand is the oldest trick in the book. Track two is mechanics, Congress, courts, revenue, durability, implementation. This is where people mess it up. They treat it like a guaranteed check. But the smarter way of framing this is like"

Cash in hand is the oldest trick in the book. Track two is mechanics, Congress, courts, revenue, durability, implementation. This is where people mess it up. They treat it like a guaranteed check. But the smarter way of framing this is like this. It's a policy signal that could become a check. That difference matters because signals move markets in one way. and cash in bank accounts moves markets in another way. So, is this a guaranteed thing? Nope, definitely not. But here's what we got to work with so far. Kevin Hasset has said it depends on Congress while pointing to deficit improvement narratives. The health of the government debts are improving in certain ways, which should improve the odds of the tariff dividend coming to fruition. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bass has said the same thing in plain English. It needs legislation for now. Don't bank on this yet. Don't cash your chickens before they hatch, right? Uh or don't cash your checks before they hatch. Either way, don't do it. Just wait. Because so far, it's still just a proposal. It's being floated. It's being messaged. It's being used as political narrative and a lever. It's not your money in your account quite just yet. But now we hit the trap door. January 14th. That is a date the Supreme Court ruling window on tariffs. Here is why that date matters. This dividend story lives downstream from tariffs holding up. If tariffs get hit legally, the dividend narrative can die or it can turn into something completely different. It can go from give it back to the people to refund it back to the guys who was taxed for it in the first time. like refund to importers, refunds through other channels, different winners, different timing. That's why I said the biggest move might not come from CPI, it might come from a courtroom. So that's why you should keep January 14th in your mind. If it all goes well, you might get that sty check. If it doesn't, someone else will. In my opinion, guys, I believe this is also a massive political play. Kill the tariffs and kill the money for the people. If the Supreme Court and the Dems kill tariffs, they also kill the rebates and the dividends to the people. Now, we need to widen the lens and focus on the big picture because geopolitics just lit a match. When presidents post like this, markets treat it as a volatility signal. I can't believe that Trump did well, actually, I can because he's hilarious and crazy, but he posted an image of himself acting"

I can't believe that Trump did well, actually, I can because he's hilarious and crazy, but he posted an image of himself acting as president of Venezuela. This is posture. It's Trump just being Trump. And what do we get out of it? Oil leverage, geopolitical risk, and a willingness to blur the lines in public. Now, here's why it matters for the markets. Regime change, prices move really quickly. Paperwork moves later. Look at what happened to Venezuela's stock market from that breakout. And when Maduro was out, that's a 3x move. When the markets believe a regime shift is coming, it reprices the future fast. And in this case, it looks more like a hopeful future for Venezuelans. The market doesn't wait for press conferences or legislation. It prices the possibility first. Now, connect this to your portfolio. This is how the risk premium shows up. When geopolitics spike, risk premium rises. When risk premium rises, safe havens get bought. When safe havens get bought, hard money moves first. That takes us straight into gold and silver. And boy oh boy have they been moving. Guys, this is the cleanest macro we see on the screen right now. Gold surged above $4,600, silver surged above $84, and I even heard it in China that silver was around $100. Crazy to see that disparity. This is elevated uncertainty printed on a chart. It's the market saying we want protection because when trust feels shaky, money runs toward assets. And this is why the line asset owners are winning keeps showing up. Hard money is bid. Just look at silver. It's on track for winning nine months in a row. It's longest winning streak ever. But that record isn't what matters. It's the signal. The hard money complex is moving. And when hard money moves, Bitcoin's narrative tightens. Because for a growing slice of investors, Bitcoin sits in that same mental bucket. digital scarcity, hard asset behavior, outside the system framing. Now, here's what makes the moment different. Gold and silver, no, they're ripping. Small cap stocks, well, they're leading, too. That combination matters because it tells you the market is doing two things at once. Buying protection and buying risk, which is now what takes us to wave number five. You guys want the fastest signal that risk appetite is expanding? Well, stop staring at mega cap tech. Sure, yes, Tesla and Nvidia and those guys, well, they're doing extremely well, but check out the small caps. The Russell 2000 pushed above"

Sure, yes, Tesla and Nvidia and those guys, well, they're doing extremely well, but check out the small caps. The Russell 2000 pushed above 2600 and printed fresh new all-time highs. Let me just show that to you real quick. All right, guys. So, what you see here, the blue, the red line, Russell, this is the small cap index. And as you can see since the beginning of the year, January 1st, we have the small cap index, the Russell 2000 up 5.78% while the big caps are up just 1.89% since the beginning of the year. This clearly shows a shift to risk appetite. And of course, risk appetite is things like our altcoins and even Bitcoin in the big grand scheme of everything also fits within that risk appetite scope. And here's another way to look at it. It might sound complicated at first, but it's really not. We're looking at the IWM to QQQ ratio. When that line rises, money is rotating away from these safe trades into everything that got left behind and ignored. Kind of like our altbacks over the last year. And look where the small cap stocks are now. They're pushing into the same ceiling that got rejected before. If this ratio holds above that level, the rally into risk becomes real. But if it rolls over, the market goes right back into the old habit of hiding the same few big names that everyone knows like the Mac 7, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, etc. Right? You guys get the picture. Now, let me add one macro beat that ties back into the tariffs. The US trade deficit printed 29.4 billion. Now, that sounds like a lot, and it is, but that's actually the lowest it's been since 2009. What does that mean? Well, imports down, exports up. Kind of sounds like what Trump has been wanting to do, right? And that's exactly how you should treat it. This matters because tariffs are being sold as a lever that changes trade flows, changes revenue, changes the story. In the end, this administration is trying to put America first. And hopefully that just means more cash in our pockets, more exports, more manufacturing, more jobs, and more growth. Now, let's move on to the fuel that we've been all hearing about and waiting for. That is liquidity. You've probably heard this before, and it's the simplest truth in markets. Liquidity is the tide that lifts all ships or sinks all ships. And in our case, Bitcoin is the"

That is liquidity. You've probably heard this before, and it's the simplest truth in markets. Liquidity is the tide that lifts all ships or sinks all ships. And in our case, Bitcoin is the speedboat. When the tide turns, Bitcoin feels it fast. Look at US liquidity year-over-year. It started trending up in mid- November. Bitcoin bottomed right after that. Treat liquidity like a rhythm that the market keeps bouncing to. Liquidity shifts first, price reacts after. Now add the debt anchor because this is the pressure underneath the whole system and probably the main reason that'll force the Fed into printing. Federal, state, and local interest expenditures as a share of GDP are near 4.7%. That is enormous. Just check out the US debt clock and think about how much interest is piling up. That is debt service acting like gravity. And when debt service becomes gravity, the system begins craving lower rates over time. So when you see all these affordability levers being pulled, it's not coming purely from a standpoint of generosity. It's also like maintenance. Maintenance to keep the machine running. And when liquidity turns and that fuel gets injected, Bitcoin will be one of the first assets to feel it. Now, let's zoom into crypto itself because the internal signals are finally starting to line up. Now, I get it. I'm here with you all. Sentiment for a long time has now been in the gutter. Views on X, they're down. Views on YouTube, well, they're way down. Fear has dominated this market for months. Since the October 10th liquidation event, fear and greed readings have lived in fear territory for what feels like eternity. This matters, guys. Fear drains positioning. It drains participation. It turns every pump into a sell. It turns every rally into an escape. So, you get the weirdest behavior. Good news gets sold. Bad news gets slammed. Everything feels heavy and if you're left holding those bags like me, it doesn't feel good. But now take a look at the supply on exchanges. Over the last week, a large chunk of Bitcoin left exchanges and total exchange balances are around 2.94. This is the lowest it's been in a very, very long time. And that number is actually even lower on Coin Glass. Either way, what you can see is that BTC on exchanges is clearly in a downtrend. Less supply on exchanges usually means less supply to hit the market. Now, I'm not saying all the Bitcoin leaving exchanges is hitting personal cold wallets. Sometimes coins move for custody reasons.

Less supply on exchanges usually means less supply to hit the market. Now, I'm not saying all the Bitcoin leaving exchanges is hitting personal cold wallets. Sometimes coins move for custody reasons. That's fine. The point is the trend. When the trend persists, markets tighten. And tight markets move fast when fuel comes back. Now, add in timing. We're around 8 weeks since losing the $100,000 mark. And according [clears throat] to Super Bitcoin Bro, sharp sell-offs historically have taken roughly 9 to 11 weeks to work into a meaningful retest zone. That is not a guarantee, but it does feel like a rhythm. So, here's the full setup, guys. Fuel improving, supply tightening, sentiment is still fearful. That mix creates asymmetry. You've all heard the saying, buy when there's blood in the streets. Well, right now my altcoin portfolio is as bloody as it gets. So, it doesn't seem like a bad idea to start DCA into the some of these things, especially some of the things. I mean, Bitcoin seems obvious to me, but also some of the more quality altcoins. Let me know in the comments below if you'd like me to make a video on altcoins. I would consider doing that. However, I'm still very, very cautious around them right now, but I've been selectively looking and dinging into some of them. And right now we're in kind of an environment where any catalyst can move the prices quickly. And we have a big catalyst coming up this week on January 15th. This is probably the biggest for the entire space. We have the Senate Banking Committee and they're marking up and voting on the Clarity Act. This is the Market Structure bill we've been talking about for a long time. Market structure decides who shows up. It decides what's allowed. It decides what risk desk can sign off or on without feeling like they're walking into a gray zone or even a black zone as it has been until now. Right now, institutions mostly hold Bitcoin because it's the cleanest regulatory posture. The moment the map gets clearer, capital can widen its risk budget. supporters position the Clarity Act as a framework that defines regulatory boundaries, tightens how the market is structured. It makes the US venue feel more legible. That's the main reason why I'm back here in the United States.

And do me a favor and like the video if you plan on having a fantastic 2026. And guys, also that legibility, it attracts size, not just small bids, like massive size. And when standards rise, serious capital gets more comfortable. So January 15th really matters. Mark it down on your calendar. It's not just for this, too. It's things that I've been waiting for. So the things that we're building, for example, we need this clarity act to understand what we can do in America and what we can't. What you can buy and what you can't, and what we have to do to follow the rules. But for the first time ever, we finally get the rules of the road. so we can act in a clear way and markets love clarity. Now we hit the climax, the big juicy drama of the day because the biggest volatility driver in the entire story is no longer CPI. It's the Fed and the Fed and the Trump administration just went into war. This is wild, guys. Whatever you think about Powell, this is an independent shock. Powell says the DOJ served the Fed with a grand jury subpoena. And he frames it as pressure tied to interest rates. But on paper, it was due to the $2.5 billion renovation taking place at the Federal Campus. $2.5 billion. But check this out. This is absolutely wild. >> Good evening. On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings. I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role. The Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the"

The Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president. This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation. I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do. >> Okay, that's basically it. But I agree down with David what he said. It's time to end the Fed. Let's like that one. And Jerro looks pretty stressed out. We just started 2026 and it's already started off with big shots fired. This is the moment 2026 stops feeling like a normal cycle because markets price credibility, markets price independence, and when credibility gets questioned, risk premiums change. Now, this is where Henrik Zeberg where his take matters because it frames the consequences correctly. He said the Fed decision must remain out of executive control. If markets believe policy is directed by intimidation, the regime risk running a muck. Criticize the Fed all you want. If markets believe policy can be forced, confidence shifts. And when confidence shifts, everything gets repriced. This is why gold and silver ripping matters. This is why hard money narrative is roaring. This is why Bitcoin gets pulled back into the center. Now connect it to the Fed chair race. Powell's chair term ends in May and Trump is narrowing his finalist. We got Hassets, Worsh, Waller, Ryder. Who knows which one will get picked? But the one thing I know is that Trump will pick the right person to achieve his goals. What does he want? Well, we already know that, right? He wants easing monetary conditions and lower rates. Markets frontr run tone changes. And right now, the market is betting on a 2026 rate path that includes cuts. Not everyone agrees on how many. The point is that it's directional. The market sniffing easier financial conditions is obvious. Now we land in the final wave because the administration isn't just pushing the Fed. It's stepping into markets directly.

The market sniffing easier financial conditions is obvious. Now we land in the final wave because the administration isn't just pushing the Fed. It's stepping into markets directly. Here's the line most people still don't have in their mental model. The US isn't just regulating markets. US government is literally buying from the markets. The administration has pivoted toward taking an equity stake in critical sectors, semiconductors, rare earths, lithium, mining. That creates a government bid and rightfully so. The markets read it as support signal. If Washington is on the cap table, traders assume Washington will not let the story die easily. At the same time, it comes with a cost. When the government becomes a shareholder, incentives change. Support can turn into influence. Influence can turn into control, golden shares, veto power, strings. So yes, it can be bullish for selected winners and it can raise the price of risk for everyone else. So it'll be up to you to pay attention to what the government has their eyes set on. Bid that and you guys will probably do really well. Now connect it back to crypto. When the state starts picking strategic winners in equities, capital starts searching for the cleanest, fastest expression of risk appetite. Crypto sits downstream from that. Plus, we've all heard Trump with all the bullish rhetoric around crypto from Trump and his family. Now, we close with the endgame layer because Bitcoin has its own state narrative forming and it fits everything you've seen in this episode. So, here's the final layer, the strategic Bitcoin reserve framework. It exists. It's seated with seized Bitcoin. That's the baseline. The regime shift comes when you move from holding what you seized to structured acquisition that adds to the reserve. This is what we've been saying for a long time, right? And I have an opinion on this I'll tell you guys in just a second. But what Kathy Wood said, she said the US government hasn't really started buying Bitcoin for the reserve yet because so far it's been built from Bitcoin. The government has already seized, which is kind of boring. At least they're not selling it, but they're not buying it yet. But she believes they will start buying to build it out. And she framed it in the simplest political way possible. Crypto still matters going into the midterms, and real purchase program is the kind of signal that changes the entire conversation from a symbolic reserve to strategic accumulation. That changes the game. Does the Trump family still like Bitcoin? Well, guys, just check this"

That changes the game. Does the Trump family still like Bitcoin? Well, guys, just check this out and then we'll get into kind of what I think about it. Hey friends, Eric Trump. Welcome to American Bitcoin. It's a little sneak peek of our facility in Texas using American energy to mine Bitcoin right here on American soil. We could not be more proud of this facility. 35,000 of these servers right here, all liquid cools, securing the network, mining Bitcoin every single day. We mine about 2% of the world's Bitcoin supply and we safeguard it every single day. So, when people say that cryptocurrency is intangible, it's not. It's very tangible. >> And this right here, guys, is living proof. So basically what you guys can see here uh is the Trump family is going heavy into Bitcoin. What are my thoughts? Well, look what happened to gold since China's been buying the crap out of it. And I think a Bitcoin will be completely different because gold has always been perceived as something as a store of value. The rest of the world is still kind of on it, right? But if America actually starts acquiring it as a strategic reserve, that changes the entire game. So, that should tell you what the Trump family and the administration feels like for Bitcoin. It's extremely bullish in my opinion. And I think that right now is the accumulation zone. And I think that it at $91,000, $92,000, we're going to look back and say it's still cheap. So, when you guys look at everything, everything that we talked about today, you can see the full map. Affordability levers, well, they're being pulled. Liquidity is turning. Rules are being written. Trust is being tested. Hard money is already reacting. Gold, silver, and Bitcoin sitting right behind them, waiting for fuel, waiting for structure, waiting for confidence to crack open. Most people wait for confirmation, but confirmation in the end is what costs the most. So guys, stay early, stay calm, stay positioned.
