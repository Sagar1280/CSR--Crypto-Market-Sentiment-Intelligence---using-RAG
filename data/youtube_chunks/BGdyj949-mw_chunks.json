      "text": "If you have been following the markets recently, you have probably heard the same message repeated over and over again. Liquidity is coming back. Liquidity, liquidity, liquidity, liquidity. Interest rates have been coming down. In the last four months, we have seen three cuts, and more cuts are expected into next year. Policy is getting easier. In fact, this week, the Fed just announced a new stealth QE program. It is called the RMP. And on paper, that should be positive for risk assets. But when you look at crypto, especially alts, the reaction just has not been there. Most tokens are still down. Participation is thin, and people have not returned to the space in any meaningful way. So, the question we need to answer is simple. What actually needs to change for all this new liquidity to matter? This video is for information and entertainment only. It reflects my personal opinions and is not financial advice. Check the description for more information. Always do your own research. So, first of all, why is policy shifting in the first place? The Fed does not ease policy because the economy is strong. It is the opposite. It eases because parts of the economy are under real pressure. And recent data makes that very clear. In November, private payroll growth, which is a real measure of the actual economy, reported the largest jobs drop in over two years. Job openings and hirings have continued to fall, while quits, which is a good proxy for worker confidence—if you are confident, you can quit your job knowing you will get another one—are near cycle lows. In Q3, freight shipment volumes were also down year-on-year, showing goods demand is still weak. And major banks have also warned that without AI, basically, the US would be in a functioning recession. And this tells us something important. Policy is not easing because growth is accelerating. It is easing because demand is weak. There is not enough demand. And liquidity does not immediately fix that. When people hear the term liquidity, they often think money flows in and goes everywhere all at once. But that is just not how it works. Over the past year, we have already seen liquidity build up in certain places: large-cap equities, a narrow gap of high, very well-performing stocks, and assets with directional institutional flows. They have all been doing very well. And at the same time, credit growth for households and small businesses has remained weak. And real economic activity has not picked up. That tells us liquidity can sit at the top of the system without ever funneling down and reaching everyday people. And this distinction really matters, especially for long-tail risk assets like crypto and especially alts. Crypto, especially alts, is not driven by institutions alone. Yes, this has been an institutional cycle, but the majority of participation in this space does not come from institutions. Historically, alt cycles only really start when more people have enough disposable"

That tells us liquidity can sit at the top of the system without ever funneling down and reaching everyday people. And this distinction really matters, especially for long-tail risk assets like crypto and especially alts. Crypto, especially alts, is not driven by institutions alone. Yes, this has been an institutional cycle, but the majority of participation in this space does not come from institutions. Historically, alt cycles only really start when more people have enough disposable income, enough confidence, and enough risk appetite to come into the space and take bets. They need to have adequate amounts of money to do this. So, the liquidity needs to reach households. It does not just need to go to markets. And recent policy changes, including tax relief on tips and overtime, are designed to increase take-home pay in a reasonable way for people in the US. And do not forget the US is a service-based economy. So the majority of people's earnings come from service industries. Reducing tax on tips, reducing tax on overtime should mean more money in the everyday person's pocket. And if that is effective, it should eventually show up in consumer spending demand. But the thing is, so far none of this has happened, and this new liquidity has not come into markets yet. And this explains why alts have been in a bear market all year. Only a fraction of tokens in the top 100 are up, and almost 90% of them are down. Just look at this table. It makes for terribly sorry reading. Liquidity just has not reached the people who historically drive demand in crypto. And we need evidence. We need evidence that demand is improving. Economic activity is actually picking up, and liquidity is moving beyond equities into the broader economy. That means watching indicators that reflect real usage and demand, not just financial conditions. And that brings us to this chart I am watching very closely right now. Okay. Now, this is a chart I have shown you multiple times. And it is a chart of the Purchasing Managers' Index, the PMI, against Bitcoin. And the PMI, very, very simply, is a broad barometer of how the US economy is doing, right? It is a measurement that asks individual companies, hey, are you doing better or worse than last month? If they do better than last month, then they get a score of 50 or more, which means that particular company is expanding. If they are doing worse than last month, that particular company gets a score of less than 50. This white line here is the 50 line. And you can see on average, this is all the companies the data is collected from. If the majority of companies are shrinking or contracting, the PMI is going to be less than 50. If the majority of companies"

And you can see on average, this is all the companies the data is collected from. If the majority of companies are shrinking or contracting, the PMI is going to be less than 50. If the majority of companies are expanding, the PMI is going to be greater than 50. Very simple. And you can see it lines up perfectly with Bitcoin's peaks. The PMI peaks here, Bitcoin peaks here. And you have probably seen this being thrown around everywhere. The reason this cycle has felt different is because of this big disconnect here. Now, I definitely agree, but the issue is what is going to make this turn around because we have already had three interest rate cuts. Nothing is really changing. Yes, the Fed did essentially implement a new form of QE just last week. This new form of QE is called Reserve Management Purchases, and it is not really QE. This goes through exactly sort of what is going on here. But fundamentally, it is net new liquidity that the Fed is creating and putting into markets. So over time, it means there is less strain on the banking sector. If there is less strain on the banking sector, that means that banks can essentially lend more money further out on the risk curve, and that that lending should end up filtering and finding its way out to risk assets. And the amount that they are going to be pushing into markets every month is about $40 billion. An enormous amount, no doubt. Not quite COVID-level bazooka stimulus, but definitely enough to push net new liquidity into markets. And this is the bottom line of this new, you know, RMP thing. Basically, it is QE, but it is functioning as plumbing for financial markets. It is not injections of liquidity that are going to come straight into risk assets like we see—like we saw with the response to COVID. And you can think of it very simply as this bottom line down here. QE and this new RMP are net new liquidity. It is essentially the bathtub is getting water added to it. Whereas other tools that the Fed have, have been pulling liquidity out. That has been happening all year. The Fed has been actively pulling liquidity out of the market. I am going to show you something in a minute just to highlight this. But what I really want to focus on is this chart here. This is the change in price of oil across a 12-month period. So when this chart is going up and when it is above this zero line down"

But what I really want to focus on is this chart here. This is the change in price of oil across a 12-month period. So when this chart is going up and when it is above this zero line down here, it means the price of oil year-on-year is increasing. As it drops down or maybe even goes beneath the zero line, it means the price on oil is declining, making essentially demand on goods and services cheaper. As the price of oil increases, this is a textbook barometer for the economy is expanding or there is more demand in the economy because oil is the essential ingredient for any economy at the moment because it basically is a proxy for energy, right? If you want to transport things around, you need oil. If you want to create things in a factory, you need oil. It is a proxy for demand rising in an economy. And when we take oil, which is this green chart right here, and we overlay the PMI, which is this blue chart. Now, what you can clearly see is that when demand for oil, i.e., the price of oil relative to the month before begins to increase, it leads the PMI, right? Because it makes perfect sense. If the demand for oil is increasing, if we see an uptick like here in the demand for oil, well, that is a direct barometer for the demand for goods and services in industries. And if there is no demand for oil, if the price of oil is decreasing, that means there is less goods and services being bought, being transported, being sent all over the US. It is a direct barometer for the state of those smaller businesses. This chart here as I said shows PMI and oil. When PMI is above the 50 line, this zero line here—I made some adjustments so that basically the zero is actually 50. You can see the economy is expanding. And it is so clear this oil line, when it begins to accelerate, the PMI follows aggressively afterwards. And when it begins to tail off, the PMI follows it as well. And what you can see right now, this is where we are, right? This is where we are. We are underneath, oil demand is trending downwards, has been trending downwards. The PMI is really struggling to get above this 50 line. This is what I am watching. I am watching this combination. If we begin to see oil demand pick up, i.e., demand in the economy begin to pick up once again, we should see the price of oil"

I am watching this combination. If we begin to see oil demand pick up, i.e., demand in the economy begin to pick up once again, we should see the price of oil begin to rise. The price of oil month-on-month, year-on-year, the percentage change tick upwards. If we see that, we are going to see oil once again leading, and that should be followed by the PMI. So yes, the PMI expanding is essential for our altcoin bags to go up most likely. That is what we have seen from history. But what really is demand in the PMI? We have seen this PMI has been flat whilst the S&P has been at all-time highs, whilst the NASDAQ has been at all-time highs. So clearly that is not driving the traditional business cycle. There is a clear disconnect. We saw earlier if AI was not a thing, the US would probably be in a recession right now. This is contraction across the board in most industries. And so as soon as we see this demand pick up, especially in the green line, the blue line should follow. And if we see sustained continued demand, that is a very strong sign that finally liquidity is flowing into the hands of the people it needs to for long-tail risk assets, crypto, etc., to finally start catching a bid and people to take an interest in the space. Again, just quickly guys, I want to tell you about Easy Bitcoin. This segment is sponsored by Easy Bitcoin. They are part of the Easy Group family and Easy Bitcoin operates a recurring purchase service for Bitcoin. The service functions through scheduled card payments at user-defined intervals. Upon processing payment, the company purchases Bitcoin and transfers it to a user-specified address. The service operates on a non-custodial basis, meaning purchased Bitcoin is sent directly to the user's controlled wallet without being held on the platform. This means users can choose how much they want to DCA, how frequently they want to DCA, and it is never held by Easy Bitcoin. It is always held in the user's own wallet. Easy Bitcoin is not available in the UK, and this information is provided for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice or a promotion. Cryptocurrency investments carry significant risks, including total loss of capital. Always do your own research. Thank you so much to Easy Bitcoin for sponsoring this portion of the video. Okay, so if this is the chart of demand, then this is the chart of liquidity. This is an amazing chart, right? This"

Okay, so if this is the chart of demand, then this is the chart of liquidity. This is an amazing chart, right? This is an amazing indicator. It is called the Global Liquidity Index. And you can see these inputs down the right-hand side here. As I check these inputs off, I am adding specific amounts of global liquidity to this chart, and it is tracking them all. We can add the People's Bank of China, we can add the Bank of Japan, we can add the banks across the world, we can add European money supply, etc., etc. But what I want you to focus on or what I want to focus on for now is just the US. If we zoom out here, we can see that generally Bitcoin follows this US liquidity pretty nicely. However, there is this weird little disconnect here, right? Very easy to explain. If we get rid of a few things first, see this chart here? This is the Fed's balance sheet typically. This is the one that you see everywhere that is always quoted when QE is happening. The balance sheet expanding. And this is the one that we have just been going through, right? QT. It has been coming down, and this is the thing that we have just finished running off as of the start of this month. Now, it might tick down one more time into January. That is what happened last time. QT stopped here, but it went down for one extra month. It might happen again. You can see it told you the price of Bitcoin. It told you how Bitcoin went up. How it went down, but then it kept going down. Bitcoin started to go up. How did Bitcoin go up when this was coming down? Well, very simply, if we get rid of this and we overlay the RRP. Now, the RRP, the Reverse Repurchase Agreement, was very simply something that was introduced back in 2013 to pull liquidity out of the system. So, you might ask, if this was made to make markets less liquid, how does it now make markets more liquid? Well, it was used initially to pull liquidity out of the system, right? But if it pulls liquidity out of the system, if we then let that liquidity come back into the system, as you see this upward line here, that is net new liquidity coming in. And this is the reason why Bitcoin had such a good run from the bottom here"

But if it pulls liquidity out of the system, if we then let that liquidity come back into the system, as you see this upward line here, that is net new liquidity coming in. And this is the reason why Bitcoin had such a good run from the bottom here as this was getting drained. This is an inverse chart. You can see these minus figures down here. Do not worry about the invertedness of it. Just know that because it is inverted. Actually, normally it would be draining, and Bitcoin would be going up here. It is going from minus two to zero, right? So, it is still draining. It is going up and it is following Bitcoin almost perfectly. But then look, it sort of trails out up here. Begins to trail out since it has been trailing off. Bitcoin has not really made any extra highs. Yes, it has gone up a little bit, but nothing spectacular. And actually, it has been trailing off, and nothing has really been getting added. So, this paints the story from the bottom to the top, but then it tails off. Now, if we add over the TGA, this again is an inverse chart. So, you can see as it comes down, it means Bitcoin is going down as well. And as it increases, it is pushing liquidity into markets. When did Bitcoin start to come down? That is right. Exactly as the TGA began to pull liquidity out of markets. And so these three things, they interact with each other. Now, where do you think this new RMP is going to end up? Yeah, it is going to end up in here. It is going to end up as another tool that the Fed can use to add or subtract liquidity from the market. And between these three tools that they have currently got and this fourth one that they are now implementing again with this RMP, if you have forgotten what that is, do not forget. It is just this new tool that they have got, Reserve Management Purchases. And it is basically just QE light, right? It is another way of pushing liquidity into the market. And so you can see so clearly between these three things, this is where the liquidity is coming from. Once we add the RMP to this, at some point it is probably going to be there in the next, you know, few months. We are going to get an even clearer picture. And so this is the liquidity picture. Right now, we have been getting liquidity has been getting pulled from the US. It has been getting pulled both through Quantitative Tightening,"

Right now, we have been getting liquidity has been getting pulled from the US. It has been getting pulled both through Quantitative Tightening, which is this one, and through the RRP running dry, having nothing left to put in, and through the TGA pulling liquidity out. Those three things have been very, very clear. Now, we are going to be adding this new RMP in. We are going to be pushing $40 billion of liquidity into the markets. But for me, it is very, very clear. I want to see this liquidity show up in demand. That is how I am going to know. Right, finally the PMI is ready to start trending upwards. The business cycle is ready to start again. We are going to see true demand through the whole economy once more. And this is the chart I am looking at for that. So, that covers the thesis. Let me know what you thought about the thesis. Before I go, I just want to let you know about Uphold. Uphold is a wicked exchange with very deep liquidity, and they made the Forbes best list in 2024. The biggest reason I would like to know is because they have this card. And if you are in crypto, you will know how annoying, how painful it can be turning assets on-chain into money in your bank. So being able to spend directly with crypto via a card is just like so convenient. So big shout out to Uphold for sponsoring today's video. This is not financial advice or a recommendation. You need to ensure Uphold is suitable for you. Crypto is not regulated in the UK, and you will not have access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if something should go wrong. Always do your own research. Please never invest money you can't afford to lose if you invest in crypto. Understand that it is very risky, and you could lose all your money. Thank you ever so much for watching, you guys. I hope you have an excellent day. I shall see you in the next one."
