      "text": "If you have been following the markets recently, \nyou have probably heard the same message repeated   over and over again. Liquidity is coming \nback. Liquidity, liquidity, liquidity,   liquidity. Interest rates have been coming down. In the last four months, we have seen three cuts,   and more cuts are expected into next \nyear. Policy is getting easier. In fact,   this week, the Fed just announced a new stealth \nQE program. It is called the RMP. And on paper,   that should be positive for risk assets. But \nwhen you look at crypto, especially alts,   the reaction just has not been there. Most \ntokens are still down. Participation is thin,   and people have not returned to the space in any \nmeaningful way. So, the question we need to answer   is simple. What actually needs to change for all \nthis new liquidity to matter? This video is for   information and entertainment only. It reflects \nmy personal opinions and is not financial advice. Check the description for more information. Always do your own research. So, first of all,   why is policy shifting in the first place? The \nFed does not ease policy because the economy is   strong. It is the opposite. It eases because parts \nof the economy are under real pressure. And recent   data makes that very clear. In November, private \npayroll growth, which is a real measure of the   actual economy, reported the largest jobs drop \nin over two years. Job openings and hirings have   continued to fall, while quits, which is a good \nproxy for worker confidence—if you are confident,   you can quit your job knowing you will get another \none—are near cycle lows. In Q3, freight shipment   volumes were also down year-on-year, showing goods \ndemand is still weak. And major banks have also   warned that without AI, basically, the US would \nbe in a functioning recession. And this tells us   something important. Policy is not easing because \ngrowth is accelerating. It is easing because   demand is weak. There is not enough demand. And \nliquidity does not immediately fix that. When   people hear the term liquidity, they often think \nmoney flows in and goes everywhere all at once. But that is just not how it works. Over the past \nyear, we have already seen liquidity build up in   certain places: large-cap equities, a narrow gap \nof high, very well-performing stocks, and assets   with directional institutional flows. They have \nall been doing very well. And at the same time,   credit growth for households and small businesses \nhas remained weak. And real economic activity has   not picked up. That tells us liquidity can sit at \nthe top of the system without ever funneling down   and reaching everyday people. And this distinction \nreally matters, especially for long-tail risk   assets like crypto and especially alts. Crypto, \nespecially alts, is not driven by institutions   alone. Yes, this has been an institutional cycle, \nbut the majority of participation in this space   does not come from institutions. Historically, \nalt cycles only really start when more people   have enough disposable income, enough confidence, \nand enough risk appetite to come into the space   and take bets. They need to have adequate amounts \nof money to do this. So, the liquidity needs to   reach households. It does not just need to \ngo to markets. And recent policy changes,   including tax relief on tips and overtime, \nare designed to increase take-home pay in a   reasonable way for people in the US. And do not \nforget the US is a service-based economy. So the   majority of people's earnings come from service \nindustries. Reducing tax on tips, reducing tax on   overtime should mean more money in the everyday \nperson's pocket. And if that is effective,   it should eventually show up in consumer spending \ndemand. But the thing is, so far none of this has   happened, and this new liquidity has not come into \nmarkets yet. And this explains why alts have been   in a bear market all year. Only a fraction of \ntokens in the top 100 are up, and almost 90% of   them are down. Just look at this table. It makes \nfor terribly sorry reading. Liquidity just has not   reached the people who historically drive demand \nin crypto. And we need evidence. We need evidence   that demand is improving. Economic activity is \nactually picking up, and liquidity is moving   beyond equities into the broader economy. That \nmeans watching indicators that reflect real usage   and demand, not just financial conditions. And \nthat brings us to this chart I am watching very   closely right now. Okay. Now, this is a chart \nI have shown you multiple times. And it is a   chart of the Purchasing Managers' Index, the PMI, \nagainst Bitcoin. And the PMI, very, very simply,   is a broad barometer of how the US economy is \ndoing, right?"

That means watching indicators that reflect real usage and demand, not just financial conditions. And that brings us to this chart I am watching very closely right now. Okay. Now, this is a chart I have shown you multiple times. And it is a chart of the Purchasing Managers' Index, the PMI, against Bitcoin. And the PMI, very, very simply, is a broad barometer of how the US economy is doing, right? It is a measurement that asks   individual companies, hey, are you doing better \nor worse than last month? If they do better than   last month, then they get a score of 50 or more, \nwhich means that particular company is expanding. If they are doing worse than last month, that \nparticular company gets a score of less than   50. This white line here is the 50 line. And you \ncan see on average, this is all the companies the   data is collected from. If the majority of \ncompanies are shrinking or contracting, the   PMI is going to be less than 50. If the majority \nof companies are expanding, the PMI is going to   be greater than 50. Very simple. And you can see \nit lines up perfectly with Bitcoin's peaks. The   PMI peaks here, Bitcoin peaks here. And you have \nprobably seen this being thrown around everywhere. The reason this cycle has felt different is \nbecause of this big disconnect here. Now,   I definitely agree, but the issue is what is going \nto make this turn around because we have already   had three interest rate cuts. Nothing is really \nchanging. Yes, the Fed did essentially implement   a new form of QE just last week. This new form \nof QE is called Reserve Management Purchases,   and it is not really QE. This goes through exactly \nsort of what is going on here. But fundamentally,   it is net new liquidity that the Fed is creating \nand putting into markets. So over time, it means   there is less strain on the banking sector. If there is less strain on the banking sector,   that means that banks can essentially lend more \nmoney further out on the risk curve, and that   that lending should end up filtering and finding \nits way out to risk assets. And the amount that   they are going to be pushing into markets every \nmonth is about $40 billion. An enormous amount,   no doubt. Not quite COVID-level bazooka stimulus, \nbut definitely enough to push net new liquidity   into markets. And this is the bottom line of this \nnew, you know, RMP thing. Basically, it is QE,   but it is functioning as plumbing for financial \nmarkets. It is not injections of liquidity that   are going to come straight into risk assets \nlike we see—like we saw with the response to   COVID. And you can think of it very simply as \nthis bottom line down here. QE and this new RMP   are net new liquidity. It is essentially the \nbathtub is getting water added to it. Whereas   other tools that the Fed have, have been pulling \nliquidity out. That has been happening all year. The Fed has been actively pulling liquidity out \nof the market. I am going to show you something   in a minute just to highlight this. But what I \nreally want to focus on is this chart here. This   is the change in price of oil across a 12-month \nperiod. So when this chart is going up and when   it is above this zero line down here, it means \nthe price of oil year-on-year is increasing. As it drops down or maybe even goes beneath the \nzero line, it means the price on oil is declining,   making essentially demand on goods and services \ncheaper. As the price of oil increases, this is   a textbook barometer for the economy is expanding \nor there is more demand in the economy because oil   is the essential ingredient for any economy at the \nmoment because it basically is a proxy for energy,   right? If you want to transport things around, \nyou need oil. If you want to create things in   a factory, you need oil. It is a proxy for demand \nrising in an economy. And when we take oil, which   is this green chart right here, and we overlay the \nPMI, which is this blue chart."

As the price of oil increases, this is a textbook barometer for the economy is expanding or there is more demand in the economy because oil is the essential ingredient for any economy at the moment because it basically is a proxy for energy, right? If you want to transport things around, you need oil. If you want to create things in a factory, you need oil. It is a proxy for demand rising in an economy. And when we take oil, which is this green chart right here, and we overlay the PMI, which is this blue chart. Now, what you can   clearly see is that when demand for oil, i.e., the \nprice of oil relative to the month before begins   to increase, it leads the PMI, right? Because \nit makes perfect sense. If the demand for oil   is increasing, if we see an uptick like here \nin the demand for oil, well, that is a direct   barometer for the demand for goods and services \nin industries. And if there is no demand for oil,   if the price of oil is decreasing, that means \nthere is less goods and services being bought,   being transported, being sent all over the US. It is a direct barometer for the state of those   smaller businesses. This chart here as I said \nshows PMI and oil. When PMI is above the 50 line,   this zero line here—I made some adjustments \nso that basically the zero is actually 50. You can see the economy is expanding. And it is so \nclear this oil line, when it begins to accelerate,   the PMI follows aggressively afterwards. And \nwhen it begins to tail off, the PMI follows it   as well. And what you can see right now, this is \nwhere we are, right? This is where we are. We are   underneath, oil demand is trending downwards, \nhas been trending downwards. The PMI is really   struggling to get above this 50 line. This is what \nI am watching. I am watching this combination. If   we begin to see oil demand pick up, i.e., demand \nin the economy begin to pick up once again,   we should see the price of oil begin to rise. The price of oil month-on-month, year-on-year,   the percentage change tick upwards. If we see \nthat, we are going to see oil once again leading,   and that should be followed by the PMI. So yes, \nthe PMI expanding is essential for our altcoin   bags to go up most likely. That is what we have \nseen from history. But what really is demand   in the PMI? We have seen this PMI has been flat \nwhilst the S&P has been at all-time highs, whilst   the NASDAQ has been at all-time highs. So clearly \nthat is not driving the traditional business   cycle. There is a clear disconnect. We saw earlier \nif AI was not a thing, the US would probably be in   a recession right now. This is contraction across \nthe board in most industries. And so as soon as we   see this demand pick up, especially in the green \nline, the blue line should follow. And if we see   sustained continued demand, that is a very strong \nsign that finally liquidity is flowing into the   hands of the people it needs to for long-tail risk \nassets, crypto, etc., to finally start catching a   bid and people to take an interest in the space. Again, just quickly guys, I want to tell you about   Easy Bitcoin. This segment is sponsored by \nEasy Bitcoin. They are part of the Easy Group   family and Easy Bitcoin operates a recurring \npurchase service for Bitcoin. The service   functions through scheduled card payments at \nuser-defined intervals. Upon processing payment,   the company purchases Bitcoin and transfers it to \na user-specified address. The service operates on   a non-custodial basis, meaning purchased Bitcoin \nis sent directly to the user's controlled wallet   without being held on the platform. This means \nusers can choose how much they want to DCA,   how frequently they want to DCA, and it is never \nheld by Easy Bitcoin. It is always held in the   user's own wallet. Easy Bitcoin is not available \nin the UK, and this information is provided for   educational purposes only and does not constitute \nfinancial advice or a promotion.

Okay,   so if this is the chart of demand, then this is \nthe chart of liquidity. This is an amazing chart,   right? This is an amazing indicator. It is called \nthe Global Liquidity Index. And you can see these   inputs down the right-hand side here. As I check \nthese inputs off, I am adding specific amounts of   global liquidity to this chart, and it is tracking \nthem all. We can add the People's Bank of China,   we can add the Bank of Japan, we can add the \nbanks across the world, we can add European money   supply, etc., etc. But what I want you to focus \non or what I want to focus on for now is just the   US. If we zoom out here, we can see that generally \nBitcoin follows this US liquidity pretty nicely. However, there is this weird little disconnect \nhere, right? Very easy to explain. If we get rid   of a few things first, see this chart here? This \nis the Fed's balance sheet typically. This is the   one that you see everywhere that is always quoted \nwhen QE is happening. The balance sheet expanding. And this is the one that we have just been going \nthrough, right? QT. It has been coming down,   and this is the thing that we have just finished \nrunning off as of the start of this month. Now,   it might tick down one more time into January. That is what happened last time. QT stopped here,   but it went down for one extra month. It might \nhappen again. You can see it told you the price   of Bitcoin. It told you how Bitcoin went up. How \nit went down, but then it kept going down. Bitcoin   started to go up. How did Bitcoin go up when this \nwas coming down? Well, very simply, if we get   rid of this and we overlay the RRP. Now, the RRP, \nthe Reverse Repurchase Agreement, was very simply   something that was introduced back in 2013 to pull \nliquidity out of the system. So, you might ask,   if this was made to make markets less liquid, \nhow does it now make markets more liquid? Well,   it was used initially to pull liquidity out of \nthe system, right? But if it pulls liquidity out   of the system, if we then let that liquidity come \nback into the system, as you see this upward line   here, that is net new liquidity coming in. And \nthis is the reason why Bitcoin had such a good   run from the bottom here as this was getting \ndrained. This is an inverse chart. You can see   these minus figures down here. Do not worry about \nthe invertedness of it. Just know that because   it is inverted. Actually, normally it would be \ndraining, and Bitcoin would be going up here. It   is going from minus two to zero, right? So, it is \nstill draining. It is going up and it is following   Bitcoin almost perfectly. But then look, it sort \nof trails out up here. Begins to trail out since   it has been trailing off. Bitcoin has not really \nmade any extra highs. Yes, it has gone up a little   bit, but nothing spectacular. And actually, it \nhas been trailing off, and nothing has really   been getting added. So, this paints the story from \nthe bottom to the top, but then it tails off. Now,   if we add over the TGA, this again is an \ninverse chart. So, you can see as it comes down,   it means Bitcoin is going down as well. And as it \nincreases, it is pushing liquidity into markets. When did Bitcoin start to come down? That is \nright. Exactly as the TGA began to pull liquidity   out of markets. And so these three things, they \ninteract with each other. Now, where do you think   this new RMP is going to end up?"

Exactly as the TGA began to pull liquidity out of markets. And so these three things, they interact with each other. Now, where do you think this new RMP is going to end up? Yeah, it is \ngoing to end up in here. It is going to end up   as another tool that the Fed can use to add or \nsubtract liquidity from the market. And between   these three tools that they have currently got \nand this fourth one that they are now implementing   again with this RMP, if you have forgotten \nwhat that is, do not forget. It is just this   new tool that they have got, Reserve Management \nPurchases. And it is basically just QE light,   right? It is another way of pushing liquidity into \nthe market. And so you can see so clearly between   these three things, this is where the liquidity \nis coming from. Once we add the RMP to this,   at some point it is probably going to be there \nin the next, you know, few months. We are going   to get an even clearer picture. And so this is the \nliquidity picture. Right now, we have been getting   liquidity has been getting pulled from the US. It \nhas been getting pulled both through Quantitative   Tightening, which is this one, and through the \nRRP running dry, having nothing left to put in,   and through the TGA pulling liquidity out. Those \nthree things have been very, very clear. Now,   we are going to be adding this new RMP in. We are \ngoing to be pushing $40 billion of liquidity into   the markets. But for me, it is very, very clear. I want to see this liquidity show up in demand. That is how I am going to know. Right, finally \nthe PMI is ready to start trending upwards. The   business cycle is ready to start again. We are \ngoing to see true demand through the whole economy   once more. And this is the chart I am looking at \nfor that. So, that covers the thesis. Let me know   what you thought about the thesis. Before I go, \nI just want to let you know about Uphold. Uphold   is a wicked exchange with very deep liquidity, \nand they made the Forbes best list in 2024. The   biggest reason I would like to know is because \nthey have this card. And if you are in crypto,   you will know how annoying, how painful it can be \nturning assets on-chain into money in your bank. So being able to spend directly with crypto via \na card is just like so convenient. So big shout   out to Uphold for sponsoring today's video. This \nis not financial advice or a recommendation. You   need to ensure Uphold is suitable for you. Crypto \nis not regulated in the UK, and you will not have   access to the Financial Services Compensation \nScheme if something should go wrong. Always   do your own research. Please never invest \nmoney you can't afford to lose if you invest   in crypto. Understand that it is very risky, and \nyou could lose all your money. Thank you ever so   much for watching, you guys. I hope you have an \nexcellent day. I shall see you in the next one."
