      "text": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse. Here we are with the first episode of NFA Live in 2026, January 8th. Uh we're going to talk about Bitcoin and and some different asset classes. How are you guys doing, guy? How's it going? How's your 20? >> Thanks. >> Yeah, happy new year. Happy New Year to you. Um, it seems like you have a case of of of of the sickness. >> The bare market blues, as they call it. >> Well, I'm Yes, I'm feeling better than you, I imagine. >> That's good to hear. Good to hear. Um, Rob, how about you? >> Same thing. I think that uh maybe you're working too hard. Maybe those Bitcoin dominance videos need to be scaled back a little bit. Maybe you can get healthy. >> Making Maybe you can get healthy like our market needs to get healthy. That'd be great. >> Yeah. Well, I guess in in midterm years, maybe we should all focus more on our health while the market just kind of does whatever it's gonna do. >> That way we're that way we're around for the next the next bull market. Um, >> all right. And on that note, [laughter] >> um, so and by the way, if you guys have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments. we might answer them at the end or if I see a particularly good one, maybe I'll I'll ask it throughout the stream. Um, so speaking of the bare market blues, I think there is a lot of people in crypto that have a classic case of the bare market blues. So I' I' I'd want to ask, you know, are there any good things happening right now in crypto that might be able to provide a cure? Guy, you got anything here? Like what's going on in the crypto space that might help provide a cure for this sickness? >> Sure. Sure. Well, there's a lot happening and but but I guess the weird thing is that there's never been such a divergence between actual adoption of crypto, actual use of and use of crypto and growth of the industry. There's never been such a divergence between that and price. um which I think is you know a big contributor to why to this massive case of bare market blues that so many of us have because you know if you just put talk of of of of cycles talk of liquidity talk of you know all these other factors to one side just looking from the outside looking in on the face of it crypto should be doing really well because as we've said before we have a pro- crypto administration in the um which has been a bit of a double-edged sword, but nevertheless, that is I I don't think many people would argue that that's not objectively better than the than the previous administration, certainly. Um and"

Um and crypto is becoming more and more mainstream. It is embedding itself or being embedded into the wider financial system, being plumbed in, if you like, to the wider financial system. And we're not there yet by any stretch of the imagination, but the goal of, you know, mass adoption, which has been such a a buzzphrase in in previous cycles, in previous years, that is no longer um unrealistic. You know, we are moving towards that. And there's a whole other discussion that we could have around whether that's actually a good thing for crypto or not. Um, and I think there I think you can argue quite strongly in both directions of that. But again, leaving that aside, crypto is the the space is growing. The industry is growing. It's maturing. It's the conditions for it to grow and mature are better than they've ever been, you know, especially in the US. Um, we're getting regulation elsewhere as well. But of course again that is serving as something as a d of a double-edged sword and you only need to look at Europe um with Micah as as an example of that. So in a way we're sort of we're getting what we hoped for in many previous cycles. We're moving closer towards mass adoption. cryptos finally, if you like, going mainstream, but it's going mainstream in the form of stable coins, in the form of uh ETFs. And you I mean, you've now got banks filing for ETFs. Banks filing for spot crypto ETFs. I think it's Morgan Stanley's just filed um for a spot ETF. I think it's a Bitcoin one. Um meanwhile, all the all the talk of tokenized RWA is just hoting up. Obviously this is something that Black Rockck and many other big institutions want to see you know they want to see assets going on chain. They want that they are dabbling in in crypto more and more. And so the institutional phase of crypto if you like is now beginning in earnest. And I think it's important to to un underline that that those last words in earnest. It hasn't fully begun yet. It is still beginning. Um, and you know, big institutions across the world are starting to to to dip their toes into the water, but we're still a very long way from what that is going to look like"

It is still beginning. Um, and you know, big institutions across the world are starting to to to dip their toes into the water, but we're still a very long way from what that is going to look like in, you know, probably just a year, two, three years time. So, there's that. And as I say, there there are ways that you can argue both ways on on how good uh all of what I've just talked about there is for for the crypto market itself and for for what crypto is and what it originally stood for, you know, back when Satoshi published the the Bitcoin white paper all those years ago. So, we've got that. We've also got product market fit again for things like stable coins um for per dexes for prediction markets and yet um we see we see price diverging from all this good news. Um I should also mention clarity the clarity act um is is up for discussion soon. The SEC's innovation exemption I think is expected towards the end of this month. So there is there is tons of good stuff happening but for reasons we may get into or might you know might be obvious to some people that is not being reflected in price charts and that is why everyone is so is so bare market blue. >> Well I mean that seems like a fairly comprehensive assessment of everything going on in crypto. I don't know Rob you have anything else to add? Is there anything that guy missed as to as to any of the good stuff going on? Anything else? >> No, I mean Guy always always gives great analysis and it's very comprehensive every single time. He's right. I'll just say that, you know, as far as like we can talk about adoption like like Guy talked about and how great it is and all this this fantastic stuff, but at the end of the day, it really comes down to number go up. And there's some people, it depends on who you're talking to. If you're talking to a libertarian and and they're saying, \"Well, Bitcoin is still the same thing and I'm going to go forward with it. I'm very happy with the direction that's going.\" If we talk about some other people who are just in it for number go up which you know they're in it for the tech they're not in it for the tech they're here to make a profit and for those people like I don't care if you talk till you're blue in the face about"

So, it's I I say we're, you know, it's a pretty bearish market right now and and I don't think anybody really cares about adoption, per se. Look at like here's an example. Look at look at Zcash. I mean, it was doing pretty great. There was, you know, things were appreciating, things were talking about this is the time for uh privacy and that's what Zcash allows you to do. It's down 17 18%. And the reason is because like three or four hours ago, there was an announcement that their core developer team stepped down. So people don't they're like well there's great adoption but this thing happened now it's down and of course now the project is you're going to find very few people like oh it's awesome. I think the people that made the money were the were the VCs but uh I'll just say this that if people are blues and they feel bad this is pretty much what the market was designed for. You're supposed to feel bad and you're supposed to turn away and you're supposed to not invest because that's how it really works. And if you take a look at like actually hold I'll show you. If you take a look at like where the 1% versus the the lower 50% in the United States, there's a reason why there's the top 1% have so much wealth. It's because they gained all of their their appreciation, their valuation from these types of assets, equities, mutual funds, private businesses, real estate, pensions, durables. And there's a reason why there's so many there's so many people in the lower 50%. It's because if it was easy, everybody would do it. And uh if that's you right now thinking to yourself, I'll never be able to do it. You're probably right. I hate to tell it to you, but you're there's very few people that make it. And hopefully you're one of the few that can actually pull it through. That's it. kind of reminds me of"

And hopefully you're one of the few that can actually pull it through. That's it. kind of reminds me of the thing we, you know, in the terms of the news and stuff like the um where like in bull markets no one cares about bad news and in bare markets no one cares about good news. It's not that the stuff doesn't matter, it's just that like it doesn't necessarily affect short-term price action. Right. >> Sure. >> Exactly. >> So, I think that's the hard part. I So, I think a lot of people learned a lot of things this past cycle. I mean, look, there's obviously the argument that some people have that the cycle will continue, but regardless of of where you stand on that, what what would you guys say um are the biggest lessons that you feel like were learned this cycle? Just not not necessarily by you specifically, although it could be, but just like as an industry, you know, what what lessons do you think we can take away um from from this from the cycle we just went through? Rob, I'll start with you on that. >> Um, well, there's one last there's one more thing I want to piggyback on because I just realized how unbelievably bearish I sounded right there telling people they weren't going to make it and trampling on their dreams. I apologize. Uh, you probably will make it. Just remember there's there's a story about a gentleman by the name of Ronald Reed. He's from Vermont and he worked as a gas station attendant and he worked as a uh janitor in a local high school and he just accumulated stocks since he was like in his early 20s, passed away in like late 70s or 80s and he amassed $8 million and he never had a very massive uh salary. So just remember that. I mean if Ronald Ree can do it, anybody can do it. It just takes time and that's pretty much it. But it's to get back to your question about what did I learn? I learned that that and it just reaffirmed it is that um Bitcoin whales and Bitcoin OGs and I think that guy talked about as far as like you know the uh cyber punks of the day, they're going to sell. They're going to they're going to get rid of some of their Bitcoin. So if you if you think like they'll never sell and they'll take"

They're going to they're going to get rid of some of their Bitcoin. So if you if you think like they'll never sell and they'll take profits, it doesn't usually work like that. They're going to sell and that's pretty much it. And I don't know if they went to ETFs or not, but you can just see that even in ETF world, we had I think the seventh largest inflow for Bitcoin ETFs on the 5th of January and the sixth and seventh everything pretty much got wiped away. So this is still a speculative market uh moving forward and uh I think the better the other part would be uh super cycle talk never dies. you're always going to keep hearing that unfortunately and maybe it maybe it comes to fruition and then uh the last thing would be uh profits. I I know like we talk about what's happening in in the markets and uh I think what' it be better is to sometimes talk a little bit more about taking profits along the way so people don't get into these types of positions. I think that would be like uh the big stuff right there. >> Yeah. I mean, no, [clears throat] I do I do think like I mean, I think I watched your show quite a bit and I think you were always saying you're taking profits through throughout the, you know, throughout the year. Um, but yeah, I mean, I guess there's no we should probably say it more just so people are aware. Uh, Guy, what what about you? Any any big lessons you feel like the crypto industry has learned this cycle? I think well in certainly in terms of the lesson that I've learned this cycle is that when when something is a consensus view when some when pretty much everyone expects things to turn out in a certain way then that's probably when it pays to be a contrarian. That's probably when it pays to go, do you know what? I don't think that's going to happen purely because if nothing else, everyone thinks it's going to happen. So we, you know, mo a lot of us thought and, you know, I do acknowledge that there were there have been dissenting voices and, you know, um, uh, people have, you know, some people have made right calls and stuff, but I think there was a general sense that we were due another, uh, you know, a similar sort of, um, set of circumstances to what"

That seemed to me to be very much the consensus view because that is how it has panned out in previous cycles. No one has a crystal ball, but we all have, you know, we all have access to uh to the history books, so to speak. So, you know, there were it wasn't a it wasn't a an idiotic thesis to make, but it just didn't turn out that way. And that I think was very much the consensus view. And it it didn't turn out to be correct. And look, you know, closing the stable door after the horse has bolted and what have you, but um I think if if there's one lesson I'm going to try and take from this uh and and go forward, it's like when everyone expects something to happen, maybe that's when it pays to be the, you know, not maybe not the lone voice, but one of the people who goes, \"Actually, I think I think it's going to be different.\" Um so I'm going to try I think there's something to be said for being more contrarian. Um, and something else I've learned, and actually Rob, you what you were saying about um about the the the chap who was a uh um gas station attendant and a janitor and managed to sort of build and compound himself a a fortune over the years. That put me in mind of of something that's really kind of hit home to me this cycle and that is and this is kind of related to crypto, but it's it's how badly um the generation below me as in I'm a millennial just that how badly um Gen Zed has been screwed over and is probably going to keep being screwed over because I don't think you know as much as as much as I get what you're saying Rob about, you know,"

I I completely agree with all that. I also think like sadly and and it's kind of apt that Warren Buffett um finally retired a few days ago because you know the greatest investor of all time, a guy who was by you know [laughter] but like we do not live in a Warren Buffett world anymore. We do not live in that sort of world where people are able to start buying stocks in their early 20s and you know come their sort of you know come retirement they're they're rich as anything and and you know can afford to retire and and have a nice life. That's that's changed so much. And I think this is I think this feeds into crypto because you're now I think we're now seeing a lot of Gen Zed are feeling so disenfranchised and so locked out of you know this previous system this previous way of accumulating wealth. You know they have very little in this in the way of disposable income because most of it goes on rent. They have uh you know they have very little um they have very little time because a lot of them are working you know all these different jobs to pay. they they're dealing with a completely different world and that it re and I think that helps explain why we saw this, you know, this sort of collective idiocy going on with memecoins and the rise of pumpf fun and and what have you. You know, I just think like the ladder feels like it's being it's been pulled up and we've got a whole generation of people, young people, who are really really pissed off and and and don't have the opportunities that we did. And like that is going to, you know, that that's terrible for them. But that is going to manifest itself in really seismic ways further down the line. I'm not quite sure how, but um that's something that's, you know, maybe not a lesson that I've learned, but something that has really hit home to me this cycle is how disenfranchised so many people are and how the game is so different now.

It's I don't think I don't think it's possible to be a Warren Buffett unless you're one of these people who's, you know, who who who goes straight out of university and into a into a job that pays you half a million a year. Most people just don't have the sort of opportunities that used to exist that used to exist for I think the majority of people certainly the middle class. >> Yeah. And this I say one thing is I think that's why everybody piggybacked on memecoins like you talked about. It was a get-richqu type of thing. And now you're seeing it over in prediction markets. You'll see culture, you'll see poly market, you'll see everything pop up. And most people are like this is where I get rich because I can't get rich doing anything else because everything is just inflating away. And that's where I I think it just takes they're going to get screwed over. It's true. But you got to start somewhere. And uh I I think there's no better place to start. If you believe that the government will keep printing money and it'll keep debasing the the value of the currency that we have, you should probably be in Bitcoin. >> Yeah. That's financial advice. I'll say it. [sighs] >> And by financial advice, he means not financial advice. [laughter] >> Yeah. Exactly what Ben said. Exactly. >> Not financial financial advice. Uh, [clears throat] next question I have is kind of interesting. I was looking at, you know, how we like look at the valuation of altcoins against Bitcoin, um, and all that good stuff. What's really interesting, I'm going to share my screen here. Um, let me uh do that really quick. I think you got to take mine out. Uh, hold on. Okay. All right. So, let if you see my screen here, um these are altcoins. So, this is total three against the USD pair. Now, if you look at altcoins against Bitcoin, they have done very poorly, right? like they're they're well below their 2022 lows, right? And they've been below them for a while. >> What's really interesting is that when you look at alts against say metals like silver, they've also recently dropped below their December 2022 lows, right? So, what's interesting to me is is just how long I mean I mean it it makes complete sense because we're definitely in the environment"

So, what's interesting to me is is just how long I mean I mean it it makes complete sense because we're definitely in the environment where where metals generally do well and and you know with with altcoins bleeding this has been ongoing for the entire cycle as we've seen retail interest essentially evaporate. So my question for you guys, do you think the rotation into metals has been surprising and as it relates to altcoins and I mean just their very lackluster performance? Do [clears throat] you think people are just tired of future speculation as to what altcoins might become? Because I mean at this point a lot of altcoins I mean the altcoin market in general has been around for more than a decade now. Um, and I I do wonder, you know, at what point do people start to say, \"All right, it's great that you're making these promises, but we actually need to see something in the real world happen for us to actually care about this stuff.\" Do you feel like we've reached that point, or are we just kind of in the zone where it feels like we've reached that point, but the minute they turn the money printers back on, you know, potentially in a year or two, like things will just come back like they always did? curious what you guys think about that. Guy, I'll start with you. >> Um, in terms of the rotation into metals, I don't think that's surprising given the context. Like, you know, I'm not going to I'm not going to claim that I was uh that I was calling for a rally in precious metals ages ago because I wasn't. But if you uh if you look at the if you look at the kind of global context and the macro backdrop, it does make sense. um gold I think you know people have seen uh the likes of um China especially and India as well you know there's central banks hoarding gold um and that's obviously that obviously feeds into a larger narrative around dolization and you know increased kind of regional polarization in the world so gold's rally makes sense from that from that perspective and also like look you know it it's it it's mill humans have been hoarding gold for millennia. So, it doesn't surprise me in that sense. Silver also doesn't um because uh you know not only did we see that the gold silver ratio um was was really starting to point towards"

So, it doesn't surprise me in that sense. Silver also doesn't um because uh you know not only did we see that the gold silver ratio um was was really starting to point towards a rotation into silver um a few months ago but again like silver I think has a very clear not only as a beta play on gold but also people understand that you need silver to go into your into your smartphone or into your uh chip you know your AI chip or your EV or whatever. um you know people understand that there's there's a a lot of industrial demand for it and obviously you know the case for copper there is is you know pretty clear-cut as well. So the rotation into metals I think makes sense and I think it's probably uh you know again we're sort of moving towards this kind of tokenizing of uh of assets like that as well. So I think it's becoming easier and easier for kind of regular investors through either through tokenization, you know, things like Pax G or or or Tether Gold or whatever. Um but also through you know we're now seeing um you know investment apps um and not only investment apps you know char your Charles Schwabs or your Robin Hoods and things like that when not only we seeing them become more widespread but you know banks are starting to build these things into their apps. You've also got um you know you've got kind of neo banks or startup banks like Revolute and things like that that are starting to offer these all-in-one kind of investment platforms. So it's becoming you know investing just in general is becoming a lot more accessible as um you know as the as as that digital ecosystem expands. So um I'm not surprised that people have discovered you know these these other asset classes when it comes to crypto and altcoin specifically. Yeah. I mean, if you look back to 2017 and even 2021, I'm trying to think of an analogy here. I guess back then it felt like we were at a a cool underground punk gig, you know, somewhere in somewhere in in in a scruffy part of LA or something listening to some listening to some folks with safety pins through their noses, you know, thrashing away on a guitar in a underground garage somewhere. And now it feels like we're a Coldplay concert, you know, it's just become so it's lost that kind of, you know, crypto altcoins have lost that kind of sheen"

So there's there's that, but also the fact that they haven't, you know, s most of them haven't delivered on on the promises. You know, it was always very speculative and it still is very speculative, but very very few altcoin projects are actually delivering uh anything particular of worth. Not for want of trying, you know, and that's obviously, you know, leaving leaving out all the ones that were outright scams and what have you. There are only I think a handful of altcoins that are you know kind of working in in a sense doing what they doing what they set out to do or you know moving in that direction and even they struggling to catch a bid most of them. So I think what was what with the the sector itself losing that kind of new edgy um uh vibe and kind of a lot of unfulfilled promises. Yeah, I don't think it's I don't think it's all that surprising that alts have have struggled. >> If you think this is like a Coldplay concert, do you think that people are trying to like hide themselves from the camera? >> Yeah, [laughter] exactly. >> Just >> people don't want to be People don't want to be caught on the crypto cam at the Cold Play concert. >> Don't look at my art.

I mean, I know like I I know you're you're somewhat diversified into different asset classes. How do you see this thing with metals having gone and and you know, are people just tired of altcoin promises and underdelivering? >> Well, I mean there's there's both there's there's two parts to that. First of all, it's it comes down to like why do people I was saying this why do people buy gold and silver? And like and like Guy touched on, it's because we've had it for, you know, tens of thousands of years. It's been around since Earth's been around. So, of course, they're going to invest in that. But why has it been flat for so long"

But why has it been flat for so long and all of a sudden it just recently took off? And Guy said it again about, you know, there is the different central banks which are buying it up. But it all comes down to momentum. Momentum and speculation. And the reason why I think people are buying it up so much because they're like, well, the other banks are buying it, so I need to buy it, and I need to buy it because I needed a basement trade. And we saw those those videos coming out of the lines for the spot gold. uh stores, retail was lining up like crazy to buy the all-time high. That's what pretty much the retail essentially does and they're just speculating and of course because of that momentum gains momentum. We lost momentum on October 10th when everything crashed around for the centralized exchanges mostly due because of what happened with Binance and their API integration and that's a whole another thing and we lost mass amount there but there's also other parts behind it. It's because like what you guys were saying is that the alts have improved themselves. I mean, crypto was cool back in 2020 21. Now, we're just looked at as we're pretty much I look at it almost as like just traditional finance just in a nice little new rapper. And I think we're kind of going down that path. And you see some of the cyberpunk type of old, they say, you know what, I don't recognize what this is. We were supposed to take over an industry and now we're buddy buddy with it. It was like the uh the CEO of um of Lyft or no Uber. He he was asked, \"Hey, when are you going to uh you know make a deal with with the taxis?\" He's like, \"I'm not doing a deal with those guys. I'm going to wipe them out.\" And essentially, he almost did. So, like all these things that are happening, like we're not the cool ones anymore. We're not the ones that I think people look to, especially what happened with memecoins and stuff like that. They're looking towards AI. And AI, I think, is the this the next bigger play. And let me let me ask you guys this. Who here has ever used and put this in the in the the chat so people are"

They're looking towards AI. And AI, I think, is the this the next bigger play. And let me let me ask you guys this. Who here has ever used and put this in the in the the chat so people are watching. What have you used your altcoin for besides a decentralized exchange? Maybe to get some other type of altcoin. Have you used it for payments? Have you used it for tokenizing of assets? Have you used it for loans? What have you done with with the altcoin that you talk so much about and how great it is? Now, I like alts and I think that like in the very beginning, I think we talked about stable coins and how well they've run. Tether, USDC, the big four on those rails are Binance, Ethereum, Salana, and Tron. I can see those going, but for other alts, I'm having a real hard time seeing like where the next big thing is. There's going to be some, but I don't really know. But I'm just asking, what have you guys used it for? I'm just curious. And let me know. And then, hey, just just real quick, indulge me a little bit, like two minutes. AI is like the greatest thing of all time. Who said it? I think it was Ben who said like, \"Hey, Alt's been around 10 plus years, 12 plus years, and we don't really have that much mass adoption.\" How long has chat GBT and AI been around? Like two years, right? I mean, for the most part. Who here uses AI every single day? I use all the time. And it's it's like it's like the great thing. Ben, throw up this this uh my screen real quick. I made an app a couple weeks ago and it took me like 30 minutes and I I I sent this to all my my subscribers on YouTube on one of my giveaway days. If you want to find out, and this is free. It's 100% free. You just go to this is Gemini. There's chat GBT, Gemini, Perplexity, all that stuff, right? Gemini is through Google, but I just I set this up in no time. And if you want to know like what's going on in the markets, you just type well, first of all, click on the link and it might ask you to give it give your email. Don't worry, everybody's got your email. And then you just type report and it'll spit out like what's going on for that day at that time and what's happening in the market and why things"

It might take a little bit longer because I have it on deep think. But you can do stuff like that. I created a a website for the local dog charity here in under an hour because their their website was really bad. And I just put prompts in and now it pretty much works. And I just all I have to do is just take that domain and point it to this one. And like I have all the dogs that are in here that are actually up for uh for adoption. Then I even put in this AI matchmaker. So I'll say like I want a dog Whoops. I want a I want to be able to spell I want a dog that is playful and healthy, whatever. And you click on this and it'll spit out the dog that they have. Then you can make an appointment for an adoption. And then as I was doing this, I was having problems because I'm not a coder and you don't really need coding.

I think people like volatility. I don't know if everybody likes it. Of course they want it to go up. I'd like things to go down. And to do that, I'd like to see I mean like the narrative I hate to say it. I mean sometime it was fun watching people get burned on memecoins and like saying like hey you shouldn't have done that. That is not that's the dumbest thing you can possibly do. You can do a little bit of gambling but you can't do your your your life gambling. I used to live in Vegas for a couple years and I I'll tell you that it never works out. But like that type of narrative it was fun but it was so damaging to so many people.

I was thinking about narratives that have sort of come and gone. I guess I guess one narrative that I feel should have succeeded but didn't was Gamefy because I kind of felt like I kind of felt like that was gaming was sort of ripe for disruption in that sense. I kind of felt that there was a problem there in that you know that you you were deal gamers were dealing with these sort of walled gardens and stuff and no real ownership of their assets. And I remember like I remember Vitalik saying like one of the reasons or a big part supposedly of him developing Ethereum was when um all his World of Warcraft stats I think it was World of Warcraft or something all his game stats got deleted >> um and it broke his heart so badly [laughter] that he went and basically you know but that's what sort of led him to I think to to you know to to to the idea of blockchain and digital ownership and stuff. So, um, I really kind of felt like worked and, you know, when you combine the fact that, >> you know, it it looks to be fixing a problem and obviously gamers are generally kind of young and online. I, you know, I know that's a I know that's a bit of a broad generalization, but, you know, that is, you know, generally young and online, which is kind of crypto's target audience. I was a lot more hopeful that that would that that would succeed and kind of you know combine not only sort of you know the the the the use cases of blockchain and the incentive mechanisms of tokenization and stuff but you know combine those in a fun way >> to um to to make a really good demonstration of of what crypto and you know web 3 which gosh you don't hear that term anymore do you but what you know what they could do. Um so but it it didn't seem to it didn't seem to to come off like that. Um it is interesting because someone was saying actually recently that a lot of these um chips you know all the all this all this chip power at the moment is is obviously being thrown at AI but obviously the chips are you know getting better so some you know the older ones are becoming obsolete or whatever."

Um, and apparently a lot of this old AI compute could be repurposed for things like gaming. Um, and also the metaverse. I mean, isn't it time? Isn't it time the metaverse came back and Mark Zuckerberg threw another I don't know hundred billion or whatever it was um that he threw at that first time around. I think we'd all like to see that, wouldn't we? We'd all like to see Mark Zuckerberg lo lose a few few more billion on um on something that just produc on on something that gave everyone a good laugh, I think, because like you know, do you remember when do you remember when his AI avatar was sort of unleashed and it sort of looked more lifelike than the real him, but it still looked really weird and you know, everyone was just like, \"Yeah, this metaverse thing, it's it's really crap, isn't it?\" >> [laughter] >> I thought that was um I' I'd like to see that back because I think that would cheer everyone up at Mark Zuckerberg's expense. >> Yeah, I I would agree. And you know what I would say? Like remember when when Facebook changed our name to Meta? >> Yeah. >> And all the meta all the metaverse product went up to like see I told you it's gonna be the best big thing. And then Mark Cuban was in the background laughing at all of us going that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. You're gonna make virtual land and just keep doing it. And I was like he might be right. And he wasn't. And he was Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's it's an odd question, Ben, because like, you know, what what narratives do I secretly hope will come back? Was that it? What do I secretly hope will come back, but probably won't? >> Yeah. >> I mean, yeah, I you know, I guess I guess kind of all of them. I mean, you know, there's nothing secret about it. I would like Gamefy to come back. I' I'd also like like I mean, decentralized compute and storage um was was kind of hot. uh you know a couple of years ago things like Filecoin and Arweave and you know you've got new projects in that as well.

Yeah. >> Decentralized with Google. >> Yeah. [laughter] >> Let's bring back Bitcoin dominance. How about that? >> I've I've heard that. >> Did that ever really leave, Ben? Did Bitcoin dominance, you know, it's still here? >> It's still below 60, though. Um, all right. One more question and then we will get into the audience questions. So, if you're the audience and you want to ask a question for either Guy or Rob, now is the time. Um, what is the dumbest thing you did that felt smart at the time? And what's the smartest thing you've done that felt dumb at the time? >> I feel dumb every day. So, >> the dumbest thing I did that felt smart at the time was invest in a lot of altcoins. the the the smartest thing I did that felt dumb at the time was was Bitcoin was buying Bitcoin because I I do remember I'm sure I've talked about this before, but I mean you guys will remember as well, you know, buying Bitcoin in the old days was was was a bit of a was was quite a roller coaster experience. You know, you'd be making these bank transfers to this thing called Coinbase or something that no one had ever heard of. I remember I remember having to remember having to transfer funds to like a a Latvian or Lithuanian bank account, you know, in order to in order to get it onto Coinbase. And I remember thinking like, \"Oh my god, there's there's probably a pretty good chance I never see this money again.\" Um, but, you know, and it felt I was like I do remember at the time being like, \"Oh, what am I doing? This is this is probably Oh, god. I'm glad my I'm glad my parents aren't able to see this.\" and you're like, \"Oh god, you know, okay, bank, this Estonian bank, all right, let's let fingers crossed.\" And you know, and it worked out and you"

Um, so but yeah, that certainly there was certainly a moment where I was sort of like, am I being a massive idiot? And and if only I'd remembered that when I was buying some of the altcoins I'd bought in the past, you know, am I being a massive idiot? Yes. But, you know, as we said, hindsight's a wonderful thing. But I I do remember that. I do remember those sort of early days thing of it being like it's just so dicey. It's like oh I I don't know if this is going to work but you know you only live once. >> Yeah. I feel like I feel like for me like you know buying anytime you buy Bitcoin near the end of the midterm year it always feels really dumb, [laughter] you know? >> Yeah. Like I remember like in like late 2018. I mean man I mean if you think sentiment today is bad man late 2018 was awful. >> Oh yeah. >> I Bitcoin was down like 84% or something and I don't think anyone knew for you know I mean and then now you look at it it's completely different. Rob, what about you? >> Yeah. Same thing. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Real quick. I mean I always felt the dumbest thing I did that I felt smart at the time and I we talked about this in the show. I did this thing called micro dcing on 2022. So I'm like I'm gonna not dollar cost average into Bitcoin so much because I think it's going to keep going lower and I'm just going to micro that. So instead of doing like a 100 bucks a day, I'm like 10 bucks a day. And I realized that was the dumbest thing I possibly could have done because I could have bought Bitcoin at 5,000, 6,000, 7,000. Also, so far uh buying digital asset treasuries as far as like stocks go, that was the that was the dumbest thing I felt pretty smart of at that point because things were going to go and just run, but that didn't happen. And the smartest thing that I that I did that felt dumb at the time was taking profits and buying real estate. The last one was an apartment complex. I didn't want to do it. And I was"

And the smartest thing that I that I did that felt dumb at the time was taking profits and buying real estate. The last one was an apartment complex. I didn't want to do it. And I was talking over with my business partner, my wife, and she's like, \"This is a great property. It's right near the beach. It's it's got so many units. It's going to do well.\" I'm like, \"But but Ethereum is supposed to go to 10,000. Tom Lee told me this is this can't happen.\" And of course, we did that. flow and you know there's something there's like a mentality like when you pay off like your mortgage and you have everything bought and paid for it just feels good like I know like in the long run maybe I should have dumped it all into Bitcoin but man there's something about just just a peace of mind so that type of thing and then the last thing I would think of like the dumbest things that were smart uh promoting into the cryptoverse on my channel it seems to seems to give people a lot of lot of >> [laughter] >> I feel like you're freezing up, Rob. Is he freezing for you guys? >> Yeah, he's frozen for me. >> Yeah. >> Sorry. Did you hear the last thing I said about promoting into the cryptoverse? >> Yeah. >> Yeah, I'll just run with it. Um, so now we'll take questions from the audience. Um, well, what would you what would be your advice to new creators to encourage creation over extraction in this industry? I mean, it's a good question. I I feel like a lot of people come to the industry to extract. >> Well, how do you encourage people to create? >> I mean, I I've always said if you just if you do the right things, like like it it it should work out like over over the long haul, right? like you know if you if you actually work on building something valuable then like your audience will recognize that but if you just launch memecoins every day like your audience will also recognize that too. Um, >> so I I think the best way to to grow the industry is for people not to focus on like launching meme coins and extracting and all this stuff, but to just like kind of put your head down and build something kind of like what Rob was doing earlier when he was, you know, vibe coding Rob 2026, like actually like building stuff that makes other"

That is is ultimately, I think, what to focus on. and then everything else will come if if you create something that people need. >> Yeah, I think yeah, it's a really good question there. I think also as well like you tied into what you're you're saying, Ben, but actually to set yourself a fairly long time horizon to be like, okay, you know, I'm coming into this I'm coming into this industry. I want to uh you know, I I want to have a positive impact on it. I think a lot of people get derailed because they take easy money and they take the, you know, the lowhanging fruit in terms of incentives and they they burn their reputation very quickly and then they never get it back. Um, and I think like a lot of that comes from short sort of short-term thinking. It's like I'll do one cycle, I'll do two cycles and then I'll get out or whatever like that. It's like I think you have to think long term you know especially if you're young like you know and you're and you're starting out you want to the idea that the idea that um you know you can just make a few million really really quickly and spend the rest of your life on a yacht somewhere I think is very very reductive. Not only will it not turn out to be what you expected, even if you do, even if it does work out like that, but it also won't be fulfilling at all. Like the fulfilling part comes from what you were saying, Ben, like building something useful, building something that improves people's lives, make makes it easier for them, whatever. That that's the reward. But I think it, you know, if you set yourself a long time horizon, say, I want to be doing this for the next 10, 15, 20 years at least, you know, I think that can help you sort of establish like I think that helps you remember things like, you know, not selling out your reputation and not taking the easy money. >> Yeah.

So like you got to find something that that helps you constantly improve and you hopefully can constantly improve those around you and help people. That's that's the biggest thing. And oh, one more thing. I know someone said Rob's got the uh fair market chills. Just to clarify the uh the micro DC was in 2022. These days in 2026, I've been using Ben's website and I do this thing called dynamic DCAing. So now I'm at the point where I am 3xing my normal buys of Bitcoin. So I'm I'm short-term bearish. I think 206 is going to be a pretty bad year. We'll see. But if it is, that means I'm just going to buy more Bitcoin and learn from my mistakes. >> Um yeah, I mean what is the Bitcoin's risk right now is like between 04 and 0.5. So >> it's very low zero point in the 0.4s I believe. 0 >> I mean for me I feel like 3xing is when it's in like 0 2 to three or something. I don't know. >> I'll see. Um >> I here's a good question. Um there's actually a lot going on tomorrow. There's a tariff that I think they theim court might have their opinion on tariffs. uh tomorrow at 10 10 am I believe Eastern but then also we have the unemployment rate coming out um if you actually look at a chart of Bitcoin and you overlay the unemployment rate the the main times when Bitcoin started to really fall in 2023 2024 and 2025 you guys remember those like summer lows we had each year or like Bitcoin just kind of like stalled out going into the summer every single time that happened the unemployment rate was also going up so and and not going sideways. So that I mean the unemployment rate tomorrow could also have a big decision. I mean or have a big impact if it comes in at say like 48 or something or instead if it comes in at like 44 if it drops back down. So uh what what what do you guys think the"

Um, but I think it would run out of steam fairly quickly because I think the realization would come that like Trump would probably challenge that and we'd get lot, you know, and that wouldn't that um that uh refund, you know, wouldn't be forthcoming anytime soon. So, I think it would be a very short-lived euphoria. Um, and if uh if they uphold the tariffs, I think that's I think that's probably priced in. But it'll certainly be it'll certainly be interesting because um I think, you know, I think it will have a a short-term bump if they if they get struck down. But I guess as well you could argue that that's probably just injecting a whole load more uncertainty. Um but that would be my guess at any rate. >> Yeah. >> Go ahead, Rob. No, I was I say I mean like it'll be good for the markets. I think it'll hamstring the administration to actually make any more deals moving forward. They want to play with China and and bind them. It's going to be difficult when you one of your big bargain ship just got taken away, but we'll see. >> Stephen says 2025 was the first red post having year. What do you say to people saying that 2026 might be a green year for crypto? >> I hope they're right. I hope they're all right. I hope it it works out. But again, midterm years, historically speaking, are pretty bad years because of the unknowns. But uh I mean, if the liquidity is there and the regulations there, then sure. >> Are there any indicators of podcasters applying to work at McDonald's? [laughter] >> This is a chart you need on your otherwise excellent website, Ben. McDonald's applications from podcasting and and YouTube sectors. Someone wants to know if we are in a bare market where do you keep the dry powder? >> Uh mine is mine is in cash um and stable coins mostly in stable coins actually because uh I've got it I've got"

[laughter] >> This is a chart you need on your otherwise excellent website, Ben. McDonald's applications from podcasting and and YouTube sectors. Someone wants to know if we are in a bare market where do you keep the dry powder? >> Uh mine is mine is in cash um and stable coins mostly in stable coins actually because uh I've got it I've got it earning yield in a few places. Um, but I think it is, as much as it pains me to say it, given current market conditions and what every what a lot of people expect to happen, I think there is a case to be made for holding some cash uh in a bank. And actually like whatever the what whatever the circum whatever the wider market circumstances, I think um you know having a bit of cash on hand is is probably advisable. Um but yes, for me it's mostly cash and stables. minus Bolivar. Keeping it in Bolivar, it's going to come back. Okay. >> The Venezuelan currency. >> Do you think that financial institutions wanting to get into crypto will use existing chains instead of creating their own? >> They're already creating their own. >> Yeah. >> Um Yes. Uh Stripe is creating its own. Circle's creating its own. Tether has Well, Tether has this one plasma which we've just um we're just doing a review of that for Coin Bureau Club members. That's really interesting because it's not officially tied to Tether, but I mean it, you know, it might as well be from from what we're seeing. But yes, um yeah, I think and you know, either their own layer ones or layer twos, which are fairly, you know, fairly easy to spin up. So yes, that's that's I think that's definitely something we're going to see more of because it's about control. You know, they don't care. um you know they'll they'll have one validator that's run inhouse and no one will care but it will mean that the chain is nice and quick and that they have complete oversight over it as well. So >> yeah, [snorts] I think it's a no-brainer for them. >> Decentralized in name only just like every other altcoin. Um >> decentralized. Yeah. >> All right, why don't we go ahead and wrap it up?
