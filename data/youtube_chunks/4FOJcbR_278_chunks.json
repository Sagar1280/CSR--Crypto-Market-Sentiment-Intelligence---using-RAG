      "text": "All right, Trump tariffs. That's the reason why the market is red today. And if you're new here, don't panic. This is a very standard Trump playbook. And within a week, we'll definitely have our pump back because all these tariff announcements actually just follow the exact same playbook. Today, I'm going to take you through the tariffs. I'm going to take you through the playbook as to why this will recover and where we're at today. And then we'll look at the chart structures and see whether this is a buy the dip opportunity or whether this is a breakdown of this rally that we've had since the beginning of January. So, that's what we're going to be doing today. I know it's a holiday in the US, but here we are bringing you crypto love, cryptoism. Let's get the show on the road, guys. You know, to the people that are new here, this could actually be a bit scary. I won't lie to you, but don't panic because this is normal. Every time we get this, it's the same Trump tariff playbook. That's basically what's going on here. And that is to announce the tariffs on a low liquidity weekend. And then you know, all the markets are closed. The only market that's not closed is crypto. And crypto usually is the one that responds. This time it was slightly different though because crypto didn't actually respond until the futures open. So, we're going to talk about that and we're going to talk about why Trump even wants Greenland. Like, why is Trump making a big story out of Greenland and why these tariffs are actually happening. So, that's what we're going to be talking about today. Big, big, big show today. Guys, before we start the show today, I just want to give some love to BTCC because based on our request, what they did was they introduced a 10% deposit bonus. So, how does a 10% deposit bonus work? Basically, if you open an account on BTCC and it's a non-KYC exchange and you deposit money into that account, whatever you deposit, you get a 10% deposit bonus. Now, here's the trick. You keep your money in the exchange. You play the deposit and then you withdraw your capital. Like so simple. If you want to sign up for that, there's a link here in the description. These are very short-term if you want. They bring them and they take them. So, if you have been thinking of opening an account, just do it because it's basically free money. Anyway, let's carry on. Let's talk about the big story today. And guys, if you haven't liked this, please, if you could like this video, it really helps me with distribution. Please, please, please, if you could just smash the like button. I'm going to tell you guys exactly what's happening. So, what is happening? Here's what's happening.

I'm going to tell you guys exactly what's happening. So, what is happening? Here's what's happening. The market closed on Friday and there was talk about Greenland and the fact that Trump wanted to take over Greenland. And then over the weekend, Trump published this article on Truth Social. He says we have subsidized Denmark and all of the countries of the European Union and others for many years by not charging them tariffs or any other form of remuneration. And he published this whole thing around how any country that has sent troops to Greenland and is opposing the United States takeover of Greenland is going to get an immediate tariff of 10% on any goods sent to the United States. On June 1st, the tariff will be increased to 25% and the tariff will be in place until the transaction has been completed for the total purchase of Greenland. So this tariff will be due and payable until such time as the deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland. Now we got to talk about a lot of things here because number one, Trump's talking about tariffs in a period where we don't even know if these tariffs are legal. Remember that the court has been delaying a decision as to whether the Trump tariffs are actually legal. And right now there is a 30% or 31% chance that the court rules in his favor. And here he is talking about tariffs again. Now, interesting that he says to purchase a country. Did you know that you could purchase a country? Cause I didn't know that. I got to be honest. Never knew that one country could purchase another country. Where does the money go? If USA purchases Greenland, where does the money go? Do the residents get it? Does the government get it? I'll show you all of that. Anyway, this announcement was made on Friday or Saturday, depending on where you were in the world. This announcement was made and nothing happened to the market. So, nothing happened to Bitcoin. Bitcoin remained at about 95,000. It was hovering around the $95,000 level whilst this all happened until the futures opened. And when the futures opened, this is what happened: gold and precious metals went up and Bitcoin and risk assets went down. So if you look at what happened, Bitcoin went down. NASDAQ futures down 1.5%. And if you look at gold went up and silver, silver's absolutely parabolic. So gold is acting like Bitcoin. Silver"

NASDAQ futures down 1.5%. And if you look at gold went up and silver, silver's absolutely parabolic. So gold is acting like Bitcoin. Silver is acting like an altcoin. It is a levered bet against Bitcoin and Bitcoin is acting like a risk asset and that's basically how the market is pricing Bitcoin. What you can see is that right now the market is pricing Bitcoin as a risk asset, not as a store of value asset because the hard money, the store of value assets, the de-risking assets have become the commodities. And now that the commodities are on such a big bull run, the market is basically treating Bitcoin like a technological risk-on asset. Now I made a whole video today. I recorded earlier today. Probably tomorrow it will be ready and I'll drop it on Crypto Insider because I've broken down how this commodities super cycle links into the crypto super cycle and where the opportunities are both in the commodities and in crypto. And there are opportunities in both places. So let me talk about why I'm not worried about this. I think the first thing that we need to talk about is the first reason that I'm not worried is if I look at the chart structure. Because I always go to the charts first now and I say look, if I look at the chart structure, it is still very much in play. What I'm looking for from a chart structure point of view is I'm looking for higher highs. There's a higher high and I'm looking for higher lows and there are higher lows in both places. We haven't had a breakdown of the chart structure yet. If we break below 90, then we may or it's actually not even below 90, it's below 89,000. If we break below 89,000, then I would say that we've broken this structure and then we need to watch out that we don't actually go somewhere below 84,000 or 85,000. But for now, after a good start to the year, and as you can see, the daily RSIs went high almost above or actually they touched above the 70 RSI. You sometimes need a cool off because RSIs remember go up and down kind of like this pattern over here. So you don't want to go up in a straight line and right now the chart structure is very much intact. The second thing is I think the market is becoming desensitized to Trump tariffs. If you remember the first time"

So you don't want to go up in a straight line and right now the chart structure is very much intact. The second thing is I think the market is becoming desensitized to Trump tariffs. If you remember the first time that Trump did tariffs, we had the massive drawdown. The second time slightly less and then slightly less. And that's because the market seems to know Trump's playbook, right? The Trump playbook is a very simple playbook that The Kobeissi Letter actually published. And I want to read you this playbook because then it'll kind of tell you when things are going to change. So the tariff playbook: on Friday, President Trump posts a cryptic message signaling tariffs on a specific country. Market drifts lower as there's uncertainty. Later that day or shortly after, in this case Saturday, Trump announces a large new tariff. Number two, on Saturday and Sunday Trump repeatedly doubles down on the tariff sending in this case Scott Bessent out there doing interviews with reporters. Countries targeted by the new tariff respond publicly. On Sunday evening when the futures open the stock market drops because it's the initial emotional support on the tariffs. On Monday and Tuesday, the president continues applying public pressure, but investors begin to recognize that these tariffs are not live yet and still scheduled and they'll take place at a later date. By Wednesday of the same week, dip buyers step in and we get a rally. Problem is that rally usually sells off. And then on the following weekend, roughly one week later, Trump posts that discussions are underway and that this is working towards a solution with leaders of the country. This is the Trump trade on Sunday evening. That evening, futures open sharply higher as optimism returns but gains fade into Monday cash open. After Monday open, senior administrative officials such as Scott Bessent appear on live television to reassure investors and talk about progress. Over the next two to four weeks, various members of Trump administration continue to tease progress about a trade agreement. Step 12. A trade deal is announced and the market hits new highs. Repeat from step one. This is exactly the same playbook. Exactly. On Friday, we had the cryptic message. On Saturday, we got the tariff announcement. On Sunday, Scott Bessent came out and justified. I mean, just listen to this here. Scott Bessent justifying why they need to buy Greenland. \"President Trump strongly believes that we cannot outsource our security because Kristen, let me tell you what'll happen. And it might not be next year, might not be in five years, but"

Scott Bessent justifying why they need to buy Greenland. \"President Trump strongly believes that we cannot outsource our security because Kristen, let me tell you what'll happen. And it might not be next year, might not be in five years, but down the road, this fight for the Arctic is real. We would keep our NATO guarantees. And if there were an attack on Greenland, from Russia, from some other area, we would get dragged in. So better now, peace through strength, make it part of the United States.\" Scott Bessent is basically saying, look, we need Greenland. And I'll talk to you in a second about why the USA needs Greenland. And so this is the reason why I'm not really that stressed. Also, Trump basically said, look, it's any country that doesn't support our purchase or takeover of Greenland and any country that actually sent in troops. So, I did a little bit of research as to like, wow, why would you send in troops into Greenland, right? And this is the look, no jokes, this is the number of troops. France sent 15 soldiers. Finland sent two soldiers. Great Britain sent one soldier. Norway sent two soldiers. Germany 13 soldiers. There's more people in the Banter office than the number of troops that these countries sent into Greenland. But I mean, I don't know if you've ever taken time to see Greenland on a map. Guys, Greenland's huge. Like I didn't realize. You know how big Greenland was? It's massive, bro. Like just look at it in context. It looks like it's almost the size of Africa. Like that's how big Greenland is. But I think it's all ice and there's not really much that you can actually do about it, or do with it. But that's what we'll talk about. Okay. So let's look at the next part of the playbook. The next part of the playbook is that the European leaders come out over the weekend with threats and that's exactly what happened. The US is set to halt approval on a trade deal because Trump threatened them with the new tariffs. Then you also had the EU is preparing up to 93 billion in tariffs and other restrictions on US companies in response to President Trump's 10% pinpoint tariff. And France, Emmanuel Macron, said President Macron's response to President Trump's new tariffs, \"Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner.\" And he also added, \"No threat can influence us, neither in Greenland nor in Ukraine.\" Shut up, bro. Otherwise, your husband will beat you up. Sorry. So, you know what I mean. Okay. So,"

Otherwise, your husband will beat you up. Sorry. So, you know what I mean. Okay. So, basically, it's exactly the same playbook. It's the empty threats. We will. No one's doing anything. You cannot operate without the United States. Stop threatening the United States. Europe can't operate. The tariffs aren't going to come into effect. You're going to do exactly what President Trump says. You know that. Everybody knows that. Stop threatening it. Just stop threatening because you sound stupid. That's basically what it is. Let's talk about why Trump wants this and how Trump's going to take it. So, first of all, I was kind of surprised that they wanted to buy Greenland, but then I realized that it's not the first time that the US actually bought things. The US actually did buy Alaska in 1867 for $7.2 million. And there's been a couple of other times where they've actually bought countries. So, you can actually buy countries. And when you buy a country, the money actually doesn't go to the citizens. It goes to the government. And the government uses it for tax incentives, to pay off debts, etc., and can make stimulus distributions to the residents. Be that as it may, I think the important thing is that there's no real war to get Greenland. This is all about a peaceful takeover in a diplomatic way. And the reason why Trump wants it, well, the reason why Trump says he wants it is because it's very strategic. And if you do look at where Greenland is on the map, it is super strategic because it basically gives number one, it gives access to a whole lot of different places in Europe because the Arctic Sea passes through it. And in fact, David Sacks actually broke it down on the All-In Podcast, which I think is a pretty succinct breakdown. \"Why is Greenland so important? Well, it is becoming more significant from a national security standpoint as those Arctic is melt and you have new shipping lanes that have opened up. So, it is important on that dimension. But look, American politicians have wanted to acquire Greenland for a long time. The great Secretary of State, William Seward, wanted to acquire it. He acquired Alaska. He wanted to get Greenland too, was unable to make that deal. But FDR and Truman both were interested in acquiring Greenland. It didn't work out obviously. So this is an old idea that's new again thanks to"

He acquired Alaska. He wanted to get Greenland too, was unable to make that deal. But FDR and Truman both were interested in acquiring Greenland. It didn't work out obviously. So this is an old idea that's new again thanks to President Trump. I think he makes a great point. Why does it belong to the Danes? It's a small country in Europe. It's not part of North America. And I think if we can acquire it for national security reasons and resource reasons, we should.\" And I think the odds, they're talking about this for national security reasons. I think it's also for shipping reasons because if you look at shipping routes because the ice has started to melt, this becomes a shipping route. You see, and that's why I think he wants it. Now, this wasn't the case in the 2000s because you see the ice was there and then you couldn't go through. But now, as the ice melts because of global warming, you can actually go through. So, it's very strategic. And that's what Trump keeps saying. If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will. And I'm not letting that happen. If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland. And I am not going to let that happen. Is there any deal they can offer you? Either like, \"Yeah, sure. I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier.\" But one way or the other, Trump says he's basically taking Greenland and here he takes the mickey out of Denmark. Basically saying, \"Look, why do you own it and how can you protect us? What are you sending? Are you sending in an extra dog sled?\" And that's actually exactly what they said do about things such as that not going to happen. We're not, you know, I can't rely on Denmark being able to fend themselves off. You know, they were talking about they put an extra dog and they were serious about this. They put an extra dog sled there last month. They added a second dog sled. That's not going to do the trick. Denmark fought alongside the United States in both Afghanistan. So yeah, I think I actually think he says that I appreciate it. I have a very good relationship with Denmark and we'll see how it all works. So, that's that. And then Bessent, obviously in the media, Trump listen to why he says he needs Greenland. \"Thank you. You named Governor Landry to be new special envoy to Greenland. How do you see that role entailing and is it still your intention that Greenland?\" He"

And then Bessent, obviously in the media, Trump listen to why he says he needs Greenland. \"Thank you. You named Governor Landry to be new special envoy to Greenland. How do you see that role entailing and is it still your intention that Greenland?\" He viewed Louisiana the Louisiana Purchase. He said \"I'm governor of Louisiana\" and he said \"I would love\", I didn't call him, he called me. He's very proactive. He's a great guy. He's a deal guy. He's a dealmaker type guy. And we need it for national protection. We need Greenland for national protection. They have a very small population. And I don't know, they say Denmark, but Denmark has spent no money. They have no military protection. They say that Denmark was there 300 years ago or something with a boat. Well, we were there with boats, too, I'm sure. So, anyway, long story short, they want it, they claim that they want it for military protection to control the seas because it's very strategic and because it helps them in a war against Russia, in a war against China. It gives them an amazing position. Interestingly, the US actually does have some naval bases and some military bases in there since 1951 because as part of their NATO defense, they have some bases there. There's another part of it and that's rare earth minerals. Now remember, China owns 90% of the rare earth minerals, the processing of 90% of the rare earth minerals. And one of the things they did was when they threatened the US as a negotiating tactic, they limited the export of rare earth minerals. Now that can wreck strategic industries like chip manufacturing, like missiles, like weapons, etc. And Greenland is estimated to hold 36 million tons of rare earth minerals. Only 1.5 million tons are considered proven. So there are minerals there. And China is stepping up interests in Greenland because of the rare earth minerals. So, that could be another one of the reasons why everybody is after this place. We don't really know why, but you know, ultimately we're being fed one story. I think it's got much more to do with the minerals and to keep the US close to Russia. If they ever needed to get into some kind of war with Russia, the way to do it could be through Greenland. Let's talk about what the probabilities are here. So, the first thing is the Republicans are saying if Trump invades Greenland, that would end his presidency. So it's not going to be an invasion. It's going to be a peaceful takeover of Greenland. Even the Republicans are saying,"

Even the Republicans are saying, they've warned him, don't go and invade Greenland. Rather, let's just take it over peacefully. And I kind of agree with that. There's a 13% chance that Trump's going to be impeached. So, he doesn't want to get impeached. There's a 40% chance that the Greenland deal is signed by March 31st. That's quite a big probability and it's on the increase, which means that they really believe. It's hard for me to believe that the US is actually going to take over Greenland but I think they will. And I mean here's the probabilities that these tariffs will actually come into effect and remember we spoke about the fact that the Trump tariffs are probably going to be deemed illegal. So yeah, so listen that's why the markets are coming down today. As I said to you, I'm not worried. I think it's a low liquidity weekend. It's a long weekend in the United States. Today's a bank holiday in the United States. I wouldn't be too stressed. I think this is a good opportunity to be buying some of the altcoins that have basically dipped and basically everything has dipped. See Zcash is pretty, everything is cheap. I'm not going to get into individual altcoins. What I'm saying is listen, if you're new here, don't panic. This is like a normal thing and by next week Sunday, the bull market is going to resume again. Between now and then maybe little pumps, little dumps, etc. I kind of think we've seen the worst based on other tariff playbooks. So, if you look at this, when we dipped down to 91,900, that was probably the bottom of this correction. If not, let's just make sure we hold the 89,200 to keep the chart structure in phase. And if yes, I remain bullish. I remain bullish. All right, my friends. I shall see you guys again tomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends."
