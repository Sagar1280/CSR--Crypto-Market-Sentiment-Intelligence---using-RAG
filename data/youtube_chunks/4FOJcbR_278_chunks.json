      "text": "All right, Trump tariffs. That's the reason why \nthe market is red today. And if you're new here,   don't panic. This is a very standard \nTrump playbook. And within a week,   we'll definitely have our pump back because all \nthese tariff announcements actually just follow   the exact same playbook. Today, I'm going \nto take you through the tariffs. I'm going   to take you through the playbook as to why this \nwill recover and where we're at today. And then   we'll look at the chart structures and see \nwhether this is a buy the dip opportunity or   whether this is a breakdown of this rally that \nwe've had since the beginning of January. So,   that's what we're going to be doing \ntoday. I know it's a holiday in the US,   but here we are bringing you crypto love, \ncryptoism. Let's get the show on the road, guys. You know, to the people that are new here, this \ncould actually be a bit scary. I won't lie to you,   but don't panic because this is normal. Every \ntime we get this, it's the same Trump tariff   playbook. That's basically what's going on \nhere. And that is to announce the tariffs on   a low liquidity weekend. And then you know, all \nthe markets are closed. The only market that's   not closed is crypto. And crypto usually \nis the one that responds. This time it was   slightly different though because crypto didn't \nactually respond until the futures open. So,   we're going to talk about that and we're going to \ntalk about why Trump even wants Greenland. Like,   why is Trump making a big story out of Greenland \nand why these tariffs are actually happening. So,   that's what we're going to be talking \nabout today. Big, big, big show today. Guys, before we start the show today, I just \nwant to give some love to BTCC because based   on our request, what they did was they introduced \na 10% deposit bonus. So, how does a 10% deposit   bonus work? Basically, if you open an account on \nBTCC and it's a non-KYC exchange and you deposit   money into that account, whatever you deposit, you \nget a 10% deposit bonus. Now, here's the trick. You keep your money in the exchange. You play the \ndeposit and then you withdraw your capital. Like   so simple. If you want to sign up for that, \nthere's a link here in the description. These   are very short-term if you want. They bring them \nand they take them. So, if you have been thinking   of opening an account, just do it because it's \nbasically free money. Anyway, let's carry on. Let's talk about the big story today. And \nguys, if you haven't liked this, please,   if you could like this video, it really helps \nme with distribution. Please, please, please,   if you could just smash the like button. I'm going \nto tell you guys exactly what's happening. So,   what is happening? Here's what's happening. The market closed on Friday and there was talk   about Greenland and the fact that Trump wanted to \ntake over Greenland. And then over the weekend,   Trump published this article on Truth Social. He \nsays we have subsidized Denmark and all of the   countries of the European Union and others for \nmany years by not charging them tariffs or any   other form of remuneration. And he published \nthis whole thing around how any country that   has sent troops to Greenland and is opposing \nthe United States takeover of Greenland is   going to get an immediate tariff of 10% on any \ngoods sent to the United States. On June 1st,   the tariff will be increased to 25% and the \ntariff will be in place until the transaction   has been completed for the total purchase \nof Greenland. So this tariff will be due   and payable until such time as the deal is reached \nfor the complete and total purchase of Greenland. Now we got to talk about a lot of things here \nbecause number one, Trump's talking about tariffs   in a period where we don't even know if these \ntariffs are legal. Remember that the court has   been delaying a decision as to whether the Trump \ntariffs are actually legal. And right now there   is a 30% or 31% chance that the court rules in \nhis favor. And here he is talking about tariffs   again. Now, interesting that he says to purchase \na country. Did you know that you could purchase   a country? Cause I didn't know that. I got to \nbe honest. Never knew that one country could   purchase another country. Where does the money \ngo? If USA purchases Greenland, where does the   money go? Do the residents get it? Does the \ngovernment get it? I'll show you all of that."

Never knew that one country could purchase another country. Where does the money go? If USA purchases Greenland, where does the money go? Do the residents get it? Does the government get it? I'll show you all of that. Anyway, this announcement was made on Friday \nor Saturday, depending on where you were in   the world. This announcement was made and nothing \nhappened to the market. So, nothing happened to   Bitcoin. Bitcoin remained at about 95,000. It \nwas hovering around the $95,000 level whilst   this all happened until the futures opened. And \nwhen the futures opened, this is what happened:   gold and precious metals went up and Bitcoin and \nrisk assets went down. So if you look at what   happened, Bitcoin went down. NASDAQ futures down \n1.5%. And if you look at gold went up and silver,   silver's absolutely parabolic. So gold is acting \nlike Bitcoin. Silver is acting like an altcoin. It is a levered bet against Bitcoin and Bitcoin is \nacting like a risk asset and that's basically how   the market is pricing Bitcoin. What you can see \nis that right now the market is pricing Bitcoin   as a risk asset, not as a store of value asset \nbecause the hard money, the store of value assets,   the de-risking assets have become the commodities. And now that the commodities are on such a big   bull run, the market is basically treating \nBitcoin like a technological risk-on asset. Now I made a whole video today. I recorded earlier \ntoday. Probably tomorrow it will be ready and I'll   drop it on Crypto Insider because I've broken down \nhow this commodities super cycle links into the   crypto super cycle and where the opportunities \nare both in the commodities and in crypto. And   there are opportunities in both places. So let \nme talk about why I'm not worried about this. I think the first thing that we need to talk \nabout is the first reason that I'm not worried   is if I look at the chart structure. Because I \nalways go to the charts first now and I say look,   if I look at the chart structure, it is still \nvery much in play. What I'm looking for from a   chart structure point of view is I'm looking \nfor higher highs. There's a higher high and   I'm looking for higher lows and there are higher \nlows in both places. We haven't had a breakdown   of the chart structure yet. If we break below 90, \nthen we may or it's actually not even below 90,   it's below 89,000. If we break below 89,000, then \nI would say that we've broken this structure and   then we need to watch out that we don't actually \ngo somewhere below 84,000 or 85,000. But for now,   after a good start to the year, and as you \ncan see, the daily RSIs went high almost   above or actually they touched above the 70 \nRSI. You sometimes need a cool off because   RSIs remember go up and down kind of like \nthis pattern over here. So you don't want   to go up in a straight line and right now \nthe chart structure is very much intact. The second thing is I think the market is becoming \ndesensitized to Trump tariffs. If you remember the   first time that Trump did tariffs, we had the \nmassive drawdown. The second time slightly less   and then slightly less. And that's because the \nmarket seems to know Trump's playbook, right? The Trump playbook is a very simple playbook that \nThe Kobeissi Letter actually published. And I want   to read you this playbook because then it'll kind \nof tell you when things are going to change. So   the tariff playbook: on Friday, President Trump \nposts a cryptic message signaling tariffs on a   specific country. Market drifts lower as there's \nuncertainty. Later that day or shortly after,   in this case Saturday, Trump announces a large new \ntariff. Number two, on Saturday and Sunday Trump   repeatedly doubles down on the tariff sending \nin this case Scott Bessent out there doing   interviews with reporters. Countries targeted \nby the new tariff respond publicly."

Later that day or shortly after, in this case Saturday, Trump announces a large new tariff. Number two, on Saturday and Sunday Trump repeatedly doubles down on the tariff sending in this case Scott Bessent out there doing interviews with reporters. Countries targeted by the new tariff respond publicly. On Sunday   evening when the futures open the stock market \ndrops because it's the initial emotional support   on the tariffs. On Monday and Tuesday, the \npresident continues applying public pressure,   but investors begin to recognize that these \ntariffs are not live yet and still scheduled and   they'll take place at a later date. By Wednesday \nof the same week, dip buyers step in and we get   a rally. Problem is that rally usually sells \noff. And then on the following weekend, roughly   one week later, Trump posts that discussions \nare underway and that this is working towards   a solution with leaders of the country. This is \nthe Trump trade on Sunday evening. That evening,   futures open sharply higher as optimism \nreturns but gains fade into Monday cash   open. After Monday open, senior administrative \nofficials such as Scott Bessent appear on live   television to reassure investors and talk about \nprogress. Over the next two to four weeks,   various members of Trump administration \ncontinue to tease progress about a trade   agreement. Step 12. A trade deal is announced and \nthe market hits new highs. Repeat from step one. This is exactly the same playbook. Exactly. On \nFriday, we had the cryptic message. On Saturday,   we got the tariff announcement. On Sunday, \nScott Bessent came out and justified. I mean,   just listen to this here. Scott Bessent justifying \nwhy they need to buy Greenland. \"President Trump   strongly believes that we cannot outsource \nour security because Kristen, let me tell you   what'll happen. And it might not be next year, \nmight not be in five years, but down the road,   this fight for the Arctic is real. We would keep \nour NATO guarantees. And if there were an attack   on Greenland, from Russia, from some other \narea, we would get dragged in. So better now,   peace through strength, make it part of the United \nStates.\" Scott Bessent is basically saying, look,   we need Greenland. And I'll talk to you in \na second about why the USA needs Greenland. And so this is the reason why I'm not really \nthat stressed. Also, Trump basically said,   look, it's any country that doesn't support our \npurchase or takeover of Greenland and any country   that actually sent in troops. So, I did a little \nbit of research as to like, wow, why would you   send in troops into Greenland, right? And this is \nthe look, no jokes, this is the number of troops. France sent 15 soldiers. Finland sent two \nsoldiers. Great Britain sent one soldier. Norway sent two soldiers. Germany 13 soldiers. There's more people in the Banter office than the   number of troops that these countries sent into \nGreenland. But I mean, I don't know if you've   ever taken time to see Greenland on a map. Guys, \nGreenland's huge. Like I didn't realize. You know   how big Greenland was? It's massive, bro. Like \njust look at it in context. It looks like it's   almost the size of Africa. Like that's how big \nGreenland is. But I think it's all ice and there's   not really much that you can actually do about it, \nor do with it. But that's what we'll talk about. Okay. So let's look at the next part of the \nplaybook. The next part of the playbook is   that the European leaders come out over the \nweekend with threats and that's exactly what   happened. The US is set to halt approval on a \ntrade deal because Trump threatened them with the   new tariffs. Then you also had the EU is preparing \nup to 93 billion in tariffs and other restrictions   on US companies in response to President Trump's \n10% pinpoint tariff. And France, Emmanuel Macron,   said President Macron's response to President \nTrump's new tariffs, \"Europeans will respond in a   united and coordinated manner.\" And he also added, \n\"No threat can influence us, neither in Greenland   nor in Ukraine.\" Shut up, bro."

Otherwise, \nyour husband will beat you up. Sorry. So,   you know what I mean. Okay. So, basically, \nit's exactly the same playbook. It's the empty   threats. We will. No one's doing anything. You \ncannot operate without the United States. Stop   threatening the United States. Europe can't \noperate. The tariffs aren't going to come into   effect. You're going to do exactly what President \nTrump says. You know that. Everybody knows that. Stop threatening it. Just stop threatening because \nyou sound stupid. That's basically what it is. Let's talk about why Trump wants this and how \nTrump's going to take it. So, first of all,   I was kind of surprised that they wanted to buy \nGreenland, but then I realized that it's not the   first time that the US actually bought things. The US actually did buy Alaska in 1867 for   $7.2 million. And there's been a couple of other \ntimes where they've actually bought countries. So,   you can actually buy countries. And when you \nbuy a country, the money actually doesn't go   to the citizens. It goes to the government. And the government uses it for tax incentives,   to pay off debts, etc., and can make \nstimulus distributions to the residents. Be that as it may, I think the important \nthing is that there's no real war to   get Greenland. This is all about a \npeaceful takeover in a diplomatic way. And the reason why Trump wants it, well, \nthe reason why Trump says he wants it is   because it's very strategic. And if you \ndo look at where Greenland is on the map,   it is super strategic because it basically \ngives number one, it gives access to a whole   lot of different places in Europe because the \nArctic Sea passes through it. And in fact,   David Sacks actually broke it down on the All-In \nPodcast, which I think is a pretty succinct   breakdown. \"Why is Greenland so important? Well, \nit is becoming more significant from a national   security standpoint as those Arctic is melt and \nyou have new shipping lanes that have opened   up. So, it is important on that dimension. But \nlook, American politicians have wanted to acquire   Greenland for a long time. The great Secretary of \nState, William Seward, wanted to acquire it. He   acquired Alaska. He wanted to get Greenland too, \nwas unable to make that deal. But FDR and Truman   both were interested in acquiring Greenland. It didn't work out obviously. So this is an old   idea that's new again thanks to President Trump. I think he makes a great point. Why does it belong   to the Danes? It's a small country in Europe. It's not part of North America. And I think   if we can acquire it for national security \nreasons and resource reasons, we should.\" And I think the odds, they're talking about \nthis for national security reasons. I think   it's also for shipping reasons because if you look \nat shipping routes because the ice has started to   melt, this becomes a shipping route. You see, and \nthat's why I think he wants it. Now, this wasn't   the case in the 2000s because you see the ice was \nthere and then you couldn't go through. But now,   as the ice melts because of global warming, \nyou can actually go through. So, it's very   strategic. And that's what Trump keeps saying. If \nwe don't take Greenland, Russia or China will. And   I'm not letting that happen. If we don't take \nGreenland, Russia or China will take Greenland. And I am not going to let that happen. Is there \nany deal they can offer you? Either like, \"Yeah,   sure. I'd love to make a deal with them. It's \neasier.\" But one way or the other, Trump says he's   basically taking Greenland and here he takes the \nmickey out of Denmark. Basically saying, \"Look,   why do you own it and how can you protect us?"

Basically saying, \"Look, why do you own it and how can you protect us? What \nare you sending? Are you sending in an extra dog   sled?\" And that's actually exactly what they said \ndo about things such as that not going to happen. We're not, you know, I can't rely on Denmark being \nable to fend themselves off. You know, they were   talking about they put an extra dog and they were \nserious about this. They put an extra dog sled   there last month. They added a second dog sled. That's not going to do the trick. Denmark fought   alongside the United States in both Afghanistan. So yeah, I think I actually think he says that I   appreciate it. I have a very good relationship \nwith Denmark and we'll see how it all works. So, that's that. And then Bessent, obviously in \nthe media, Trump listen to why he says he needs   Greenland. \"Thank you. You named Governor Landry \nto be new special envoy to Greenland. How do you   see that role entailing and is it still your \nintention that Greenland?\" He viewed Louisiana   the Louisiana Purchase. He said \"I'm governor of \nLouisiana\" and he said \"I would love\", I didn't   call him, he called me. He's very proactive. He's \na great guy. He's a deal guy. He's a dealmaker   type guy. And we need it for national protection. We need Greenland for national protection. They   have a very small population. And I don't know, \nthey say Denmark, but Denmark has spent no money. They have no military protection. They say that \nDenmark was there 300 years ago or something   with a boat. Well, we were there with boats, \ntoo, I'm sure. So, anyway, long story short,   they want it, they claim that they want it for \nmilitary protection to control the seas because   it's very strategic and because it helps them in \na war against Russia, in a war against China. It   gives them an amazing position. Interestingly, the \nUS actually does have some naval bases and some   military bases in there since 1951 because as part \nof their NATO defense, they have some bases there. There's another part of it and that's rare \nearth minerals. Now remember, China owns 90%   of the rare earth minerals, the processing of \n90% of the rare earth minerals. And one of the   things they did was when they threatened the \nUS as a negotiating tactic, they limited the   export of rare earth minerals. Now that can wreck \nstrategic industries like chip manufacturing,   like missiles, like weapons, etc. And Greenland \nis estimated to hold 36 million tons of rare earth   minerals. Only 1.5 million tons are considered \nproven. So there are minerals there. And China   is stepping up interests in Greenland because \nof the rare earth minerals. So, that could be   another one of the reasons why everybody is \nafter this place. We don't really know why,   but you know, ultimately we're being fed \none story. I think it's got much more to   do with the minerals and to keep the US \nclose to Russia. If they ever needed to   get into some kind of war with Russia, the \nway to do it could be through Greenland. Let's talk about what the probabilities are here. So, the first thing is the Republicans are saying   if Trump invades Greenland, that would end \nhis presidency. So it's not going to be an   invasion. It's going to be a peaceful takeover \nof Greenland. Even the Republicans are saying,   they've warned him, don't go and invade Greenland. Rather, let's just take it over peacefully. And I   kind of agree with that. There's a 13% chance that \nTrump's going to be impeached. So, he doesn't want   to get impeached. There's a 40% chance that the \nGreenland deal is signed by March 31st. That's   quite a big probability and it's on the increase, \nwhich means that they really believe."

And I mean here's the probabilities that these \ntariffs will actually come into effect and   remember we spoke about the fact that the Trump \ntariffs are probably going to be deemed illegal. So yeah, so listen that's why the markets \nare coming down today. As I said to you,   I'm not worried. I think it's a low liquidity \nweekend. It's a long weekend in the United   States. Today's a bank holiday in the United \nStates. I wouldn't be too stressed. I think   this is a good opportunity to be buying some \nof the altcoins that have basically dipped and   basically everything has dipped. See Zcash is \npretty, everything is cheap. I'm not going to   get into individual altcoins. What I'm saying is \nlisten, if you're new here, don't panic. This is   like a normal thing and by next week Sunday, the \nbull market is going to resume again. Between now   and then maybe little pumps, little dumps, \netc. I kind of think we've seen the worst   based on other tariff playbooks. So, if you \nlook at this, when we dipped down to 91,900,   that was probably the bottom of this correction. If not, let's just make sure we hold the 89,200 to   keep the chart structure in phase. And if yes, \nI remain bullish. I remain bullish. All right,   my friends. I shall see you guys again \ntomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends."
