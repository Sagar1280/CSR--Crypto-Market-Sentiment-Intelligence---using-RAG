      "text": "We finally had the crypto breakout. We've been talking about this crypto breakout for days before it happened and it finally happened. I think now what most people don't understand is they don't understand how significant this breakout actually is. It looks like it's just a small breakout. But I'm going to show you why this breakout is so significant. Then it's probably a good time to just reiterate what my thesis is and where we're going. What my exact prediction is of where we're going from here. Then I'm going to show you because where we're going is pretty bullish. I'm going to show you some trades that I've been taking and some setups that I've been taking. I think I'm going to start trading a lot more on the show because I'm starting to take a whole lot of trades and the community's been saying, \"Well, look, share your trades, share your trades.\" Now, usually I share the trades in Front Runners, but I'm actually going to start making some trades on the show today. So, today we are looking at this breakout, why it's so significant. We are going to look at my exact prediction for what's going to happen next. I'm going to show you all the hurdles and I'm also going to take some trades with you live today on the show. So, big show today. Nice to be back. Nice to have a bullish green day on the bubbles. I mean, when was the last time that we woke up to a day like this? Let's celebrate this day, guys. Let's celebrate this day together. I think we deserve it. Let's get the show on the road, guys. You know, I can't explain to you how hard it is making crypto content when the markets don't move. Then finally, when you and we still make content each and every single day regardless of whether the markets move or don't move, we're here because we believe that consistency is integrity. We believe that consistency is a superpower. So whereas most other people have left, we're here and we're making content every single day. But then when you get a day like today and everything starts running again and it's not about the fact that it's running. The fact that it's running, great. That's one thing. But the thing is that we've had this breakout and this breakout is a super important breakout. I'm going to show you why it's a super important breakout in one second. All I need you to do before I show you that, please help me and smash that like button. I know it's a small thing that I ask of you guys to like and subscribe to the channel, but it really makes a massive difference to us. You know, you get these shows for free. We work really hard and all we ask for is just smash the like button. Takes you one second and it really helps us"

I see Hobby Horizons. I went to pee earlier and someone said he also went. Alex said I'm going to read what Alex said. Shaki I see here, Glen Goldberg. Glen Goldberg I see you everywhere guys. Thanks for being here. You guys are amazing. You guys are the ones that have stuck with us through the bull market, the bear market, the sideways market, and we're still here together. 247 Terminal is the best. I agree. It's really a very powerful tool. Anyway, let's talk about the breakout. Enough of the niceties. Let's talk about this breakout and why I'm so excited about the breakout. When you look at it at a numbers value, not so big. I mean, it's 92 to 95. That's not a breakout that you want to be excited about. But let me show you what the areas of excitement are for me. I mentioned to you yesterday when we were on the show, I mentioned to you that if we get through this line, we are back in the upward channel. Yesterday when we were on the show, we were trying to break through this line and we eventually crossed into this line and we closed in this upward channel that we've been in since the beginning of 2022 or mid 2022. We had lost this channel and losing this channel was quite a significant loss of a channel because then you know you're in this empty space over here and then you're only reliant on these levels as to where you're going to go next in the charts. The second thing which is super important is remember I said to you that there was this long area of support and resistance, very long and very significant area of support and resistance which was at around the 94,000, 95,000 level. That was significant resistance; it was one of the longest support resistance points on the charts and we've now broken through that point. But not only did we break through that point, we closed above that point and not only have we closed above that point, we're now trading significantly above it. We're now at 95,500. This was quite a big resistance point on the charts. Every time in"

But not only did we break through that point, we closed above that point and not only have we closed above that point, we're now trading significantly above it. We're now at 95,500. This was quite a big resistance point on the charts. Every time in the last couple of weeks when we've been fighting, we've been fighting that resistance point. We got knocked down in that resistance point. We got knocked down at that resistance point. It looks like we're finally putting all this upward pressure and actually getting above this resistance point. We also broke an ascending triangle pattern. For those of you who don't know what an ascending triangle pattern looks like, that is an ascending triangle pattern. Usually when you break out, it's quite a significant breakout. We broke the momentum. We broke the sentiment. The Fear and Greed has gone from fear into neutral. Now, super important that you understand why this is so important, right? Because in the past, every time that we've broken out from extreme fear and fear, we usually go into greed. That means that the market usually runs into greed. So, if you look at all these times over here when we're in extreme fear and fear, when we broke out, we went back to green. When we go back to green, that means that the markets are actually starting to run again. So this breakout is a little bit more significant. When you talk about sentiment, this is probably measuring a very broad market sentiment. So what I like to do is I don't look at the sentiment because sentiment is measured by sentiment, tweets, etc. I like to look at the data that drives the sentiment. Now, here I have a little bit of a secret weapon tool. It's called Coin Market Manager. What Coin Market Manager does is it actually has got the best Hyperliquid tracker. The reason I like Hyperliquid is because that's where the whales are trading decentralized perpetuals, right? What these guys have done is they've broken down the cohorts basically to show the shrimps. These are the small guys and then the fish and the dolphins and the apex predators and they show you what each cohort, whether they long, short, bullish or indecisive. So, when I look at the Fear and Greed indicator, this is like a broad market. Are you bullish? Are you bearish? It's almost like comparing a poll to PolyMarket. Right? So in a poll, you're just basically asking people, hey, bullish, bearish, you may be looking at people's tweets, etc. But then you look at where they put their money, where they putting their"

So in a poll, you're just basically asking people, hey, bullish, bearish, you may be looking at people's tweets, etc. But then you look at where they put their money, where they putting their money. So I can tell you, look, I'm bullish, but then I'm not putting my money down. Then am I really that bullish? No, then I'm not that bullish. What's going on here is that this is showing you where the Hyperliquid whales are putting down their money. Now the good thing is that when you look at the whales or all the cohorts, all the cohorts are pretty much greener. In other words, what's happened recently has changed the sentiment to such an extent that all the cohorts and especially the big cohorts, the money printers, the smart money, when you start looking at the really big cohorts except for the Leviathan, which is the biggest cohort, every single other one of these is positioned bullishly. So that means that people are putting their money where their mouth is. The next thing that has changed is that the RSI is back over 45. Now, that's not a, you may say, okay, well, that's just RSIs and it's just chart levels, but this is a very significant chart level. The reason why this is a very significant chart level is because every time in a bull market, the RSI stays above 45. Generally, when the RSI breaks below 45, that takes us into a bear market. You can see that over here we went below and that took us into a bear market. You can see it over here when we're in the bear market. You can see it in 2021, we went below 45 and we were in the bear market. I said to you that if we break down below the 45, then I will have to admit that we're one step closer to being in a bear market. However, in bear markets, the RSI doesn't break above 45 again, except for once, right? So, basically, except for once here, you can see that once we broke below, the next time we broke above, it was back into the bull market. Here, once we broke below, the next time we broke above, it was back in the bull market. Here, we had one fake out in 2021, but then we went straight back into the bear market. We're now coming back above the 45 on the RSIs, which tells me that we may still be in a bull market. The next thing that I want to look at"

We're now coming back above the 45 on the RSIs, which tells me that we may still be in a bull market. The next thing that I want to look at is I want to look at the ETHBTC chart because that shows me where we are when it comes to altcoins versus Bitcoin. Here you can see that we're actually up against some big resistance here. So, this is the chart of ETHBTC. What you can see is that we are currently at this point over here where we're just about to test this thing. This is quite a big decision point. So in general, this is a very, very big and very significant breakout. It's not just price going up $25,000 or $5,000. We've broken lots of key levels and those breaks of lots of key levels we've been waiting for a long time. We've been calling it for a long time and it's happened. Now I want to analyze the pump by looking at the on-chain data. So the first thing that you need to look at here is you need to say what's driving this and what's driving this is that this is driven by spot and not by perpetuals. Good. Because that means real buyers are coming in and not just leverage Degen apes who are moving in and get flushed out every single time. This is not that kind of pump. This is the kind of pump that is driven by spot and that is driven by I want to show you this chart over here. This is not driven by the retail investors. This pump as you can see the retail investors are nowhere near this pump which means that this pump is driven by spot institutional buying. The retail investors are here and you can basically see the retail investors are nowhere near this pump. The retail investors also are not taking leverage into this pump, which means that this is not one of those flimsy pumps that's driven by flimsy people taking leverage. In fact, this pump is not even yet driven by a short squeeze. So, yes, a lot of shorts were actually Rekt yesterday. So, you can see that about $680 million worth of shorts were Rekt. What we're seeing here is that the higher this goes, the more shorts are actually being opened, which means that the leverage traders are betting against this pump. Now, why am I telling you this? Because if this is an institutional-driven pump and it's a pump that lasts, and people are betting short"

Because if this is an institutional-driven pump and it's a pump that lasts, and people are betting short against it, rest assured that very, very soon there's going to be a short squeeze. That short squeeze is going to take us very, very close, if not over the $100,000 level. You can see it. You know, you can't argue with the on-chain data. The on-chain data is basically saying, \"Listen, this pump is driven by spot.\" It's not driven by retail. The more we go up, the more shorts are piling up, which can be reversed. When you get reversed, they get a short squeeze. Then I look at this chart over here. Now, this chart shows when we get deleveraging events. Generally, we get these what they call deleveraging events before Bitcoin goes up. We've just had a massive deleveraging event. Generally just after that you can see Bitcoin actually starts to go up. So from an on-chain perspective, this pump looks amazing. Absolutely amazing. So I trust this pump. I've been talking about this pump for a long time. I've been arguing about this pump for a long time. I basically told you guys that I think that this pump will take us back into the bull market. So I think this is a very good time for me to lay out my thesis so it's very clear to everyone. I want to show you exactly what I think is going to happen and exactly what I'm doing about it. It's going to be in this video so we can never then argue as to whether I was bullish or bearish. I've been bullish all along saying that I think the 10th of October was a blip and that we're in a bull market. I'm not saying that with my eyes completely closed and with blind belief. I'm going to base it on a few things for now. I think from a chart structure point of view, number one, we've broken the key level here. Number two, we're back in the upward trend and the chart is printing higher highs and higher lows, which is a very healthy chart structure. The RSI closed above 45 and that says to me that we're still in the bull market. I think to be clear, I think that we are still in a bull market. I give it a 70% chance because you can't say 100%. 70% chance that we're in a bull market, 30% chance that we're in"

I give it a 70% chance because you can't say 100%. 70% chance that we're in a bull market, 30% chance that we're in a bear market. The four-year cyclists believe that the bull market is over. I don't. I believe that we will follow the business cycle. I believe that the 10th of October did so much damage to crypto that only now the damage is starting to be cleaned up and we're basically going into back into normal market conditions. That's why the RSI is going back above 45. That's why the market is starting to climb. I don't see a world where the business cycle expands, where traditional markets expand, where commodities rip and go on an all-time high, and crypto just doesn't. I don't see a world like that. I cannot imagine a world where crypto, which is the ultimate commodity store of value and where crypto is the ultimate technology, doesn't run when markets run. When I entered this game, someone said to me, \"Never bet against the Fed.\" I think what they meant there was to say, \"Never bet against what the government's telling you they're going to do.\" Right? Especially in an age of Powell and Trump's come out and said that well, we are in a bull market. We're in a commodity super cycle. Just look at what the commodities are doing. The stock markets are pretty much all at all-time highs. The SPX is basically breaking out of an upward channel that it's been at for a long time. I don't see a world where on this backdrop where the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent came out and basically said 2025 was the laying of the table, but the banquet is only going to happen in 2026. I don't know if you guys saw this, but let me play it for you here. [Video Clip: Scott Bessent on the economy] \"Categorize 2025. We had some important victories, some important policy announcements, some important movement, but I, as I've described it, 2025 was setting the table, and I especially on the economy, I think the feast and the banquet's going to be in 2026.\" Feast. So, he's saying that the feast, the banquet are going to be in 2026. But then when I look at what Trump's saying, he's saying the feast and the banquet have already started and the results are in and the Trump economic boom is officially begun.

It's really begun almost from the and the result. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if you saw some other comments that he made yesterday specifically around Powell. Probably worth listening to. [Video Clip: Trump discussing Powell and rates] \"In the Fed, we have a real stiff in the Fed, but that's for another day. But they raise rates. So, everyone says, 'Oh, they announced great numbers. It's great, great, great, and the market goes down because they immediately raise rates.' No. When the market goes up, they should lower rates. You want to see 20% and 25%. You want to see what we can do. We've got to go back to an old standard. When there's good news, the market should go up, not go down. Does that make sense to everybody? And that's the way it...\" I mean, he's right. When there's good news, the market should go up, not down. Now, when there's good news, we're so worried the Fed's going to raise interest rates that the market doesn't do that in that way. Trump's right. You can see that Trump and his team and Bessent and everybody else is on a mission and they're going to appoint their own Fed chair which is going to be on exactly the same mission. I don't see a world where you can bet against a technology and a commodity, the ultimate technology and commodity combination in a year like that. Especially when we haven't even tapped the real money. If you look at crypto allocations and clients accounts, if you're looking at financial advisers, 57% of them are going to increase. 42 are going to maintain and 1% are going to decrease. At the same time, we haven't even tapped real money yet. If you think that the ETF inflows that we got last year were real money, then let me break it to you in a very nice way. The sovereign pension funds and the sovereign nation states have not started allocating. They're the biggest capital allocators in the world. Even in the US, the capital allocators that have been given money to Bitcoin and to ETFs have only given it to Bitcoin and haven't really started to deploy their wallets yet. They're going to be at a 5% allocation of crypto in their portfolios. They've admitted it and most of them aren't even at a half a percent. The big ones haven't even started buying yet. So, yes, we've had Harvard endowment and"

So, yes, we've had Harvard endowment and maybe one or two endowments, but we haven't even scratched the surface yet. We're probably going to do that now in 2026. So, my thesis is that there's going to be a bull market, but I think that there's going to be some hurdles, short-term hurdles along the way. Again, I want to be clear. My thesis, 30% chance we're in a bear market. 70% overwhelming chance, two and a half times that chance we're in a bull market. When will I confirm that we're in a bull market? What is the road to get to that bull market? That's the important thing here. So, I'm not blind. I know that this is going to happen. We're not just going to go from today from 96,000 where we are today all the way up to all-time highs. There's going to be lots of hurdles along the way and I want to talk to you about every single one of those hurdles and what I plan to do in those hurdles. The first thing is we've broken a massive hurdle today by getting over this 95,000 level. We got to close above this and I think we will close above it. Then we're going to get to some other hurdle points. We're going to get to $100,000. When we get to $100,000, it's a psychological level. It's not a chart level. It's a psychological level. When we get to the $100,000 level, we're going to face resistance again. At that same level, there's the 50 Weekly SMA, which is one of the key pillars that we're looking at. That's at 101,000. So, between 100,000 and 102,000, we're going to struggle. So, we're going to go up now from now close to 100,000. When we get to 100,000, we probably going to reject a little bit. When we get above 100,000, we're going to hit for me the most important level of all. That is the 200-day Simple Moving Average. That's at 106,000 today. Why is it the most important line of all? Because in bear markets, once we break below it, generally we just retest it. If we're in a bear market, we're going to go down. If we're in a bull market, we're going to go up. That's the way that I see it. And so between now and 100, we'll get some problems at 100. Then at 106, we're"

If we're in a bull market, we're going to go up. That's the way that I see it. And so between now and 100, we'll get some problems at 100. Then at 106, we're going to face our biggest test yet. If we break above the 106,000, the bull market is back on and 10/10 was just a correction. If we don't and we reject off here and we start going down here just like we did in 2021 and just like we did in 2017, I'm going to have to concede that we're going to be in a bear market. For me, this is the most important level because from here to there, I think we're going to have a run. When we get there, it's decision time. When we get there, if we break through it, we're back in the bull market. If we don't, we could go into the bear market. You need to know that. You need to be prepared for that. Right now, I'm bullish. I'm bullish until we get to between 104 and 107. Why don't I say 106 exactly? Because I know that price never rejects directly off the line. If you want to prepare, prepare at that point in time. So, what do I mean by prepare? Number one, for now, I'm going long and I'm going long until we get to the 105, 106. At the same time, when we get near the 105 and 106, I'm going to sell all the things that I said I was going to sell if we get a bounce. I know you're holding tokens in your portfolio that you said if we get a bounce, I'm going to sell those tokens. Well, when we break 100, start thinking of selling those tokens. Between 104 and 107, make sure that you are out of every single token that you don't want to be holding in your portfolio. Be ruthless about it. Swap them into things that you actually want to be in. I know you're holding those tokens 'cause I'm also holding those tokens. I've got, for example, I've got Sonic in my portfolio. Not sure if I want to hold it. I'm holding it because of the flying tulip launch, but I'm not sure if I want to hold it. When we get to 105, 106, I'm going to seriously reconsider why I'm holding that token. You should do exactly the same. After the 106, 107, if we break above it, make sure that you're only holding the tokens that you want to be holding for the rest"

After the 106, 107, if we break above it, make sure that you're only holding the tokens that you want to be holding for the rest of the bull market, and you're not holding rats and mice, and you're not holding junk. It feels so good. I looked at my portfolio today. My portfolio is so good. I'm holding the best tokens out there. I'll show you my portfolio in another video. Cool. So, that's my thesis. Bull market at least a bull market until 104, 105 with some resistance at between 100 and 101. At 106, 104 to 107, we're going to make a decision. If we get up, if we fly through, bull market it is. If not, we got to reconsider and we'll decide if it's the bear market or not the bear market. That's it. You've heard my thesis. What are the hurdles? What could get in the way? Where can we expect shakes? Because it's not going to be a straight lineup. The first shake that I think we can expect is the Trump tariff ruling could come as soon as today. If it comes, problem is that Trump set a precedent. He said that if the court rules against him, we're toast. Look at the prices are running. Just look at the prices. I'm so glad we made the show when we made the show because the prices are absolutely exploding. Amazing. The thesis is playing out exactly like we told you it was going to happen. If the Supreme Court rules against Trump today, markets are going to take a back. Markets are going to get hit for a short term and then they're going to realize that Trump's got already a plan B and a plan C. We could get if the Supreme Court rules that Trump tariffs are illegal, we could get an Iranian bombardment. Why? Because they might play this distraction game. So just keep your eyes open for that. The market is predicting that there's an Iranian attack probably by the end of Jan. I mean just look at this by 80% by the end of March. So the market is predicting an Iranian attack. I think this would be good for markets, lower oil prices. The next thing that could be a hurdle. Everyone's very excited about this Clarity Act that is coming through. Paul Atkins on CNBC says it's a very big week for crypto. Well, the Congress passed and the president signed a bill late last year that was called the Genius"

      "text": "eyes open for that. The market is predicting that there's an Iranian attack probably by the end of Jan. I mean just look at this by 80% by the end of March. So the market is predicting an Iranian attack. I think this would be good for markets, lower oil prices. The next thing that could be a hurdle. Everyone's very excited about this Clarity Act that is coming through. Paul Atkins on CNBC says it's a very big week for crypto. Well, the Congress passed and the president signed a bill late last year that was called the Genius Act and that was really seminal. It was the first statute that the United States government has adopted to recognize a crypto asset. So that was great and it helped to bring clarity also to stablecoins. So now comes the next step. A good bipartisan effort by both houses of Congress to bring certainty to the market. Big, big, everyone's excited about the Clarity Act and we need the Clarity Act to pass and they are scrambling to get it through. But if we don't get it through, there is a big problem. The big problem is that there's the midterm elections. At the midterm elections, PolyMarket predicts that there'll be a 78% chance that the Democrats will win the house. When the Democrats win the House, I think it's going to be much, much harder to get this Clarity Act through. So we need to get the Clarity Act through. Right now, PolyMarket is saying that there's a 55% chance or 54% chance that the act, the Clarity Act, will be signed into law in 2026. This unlocks a lot of clarity and therefore a lot of money by big institutions to come into crypto. I'm worried that they're not going to get this done on time. I think the US democratic system works, but the US democratic system takes a long time to do things, and I'm worried they're not going to get it done on time. This might be one of the big thorns that actually sends the market back. Then the one thing that is really scary and I'm keeping an eye on, and remember this is all up against a bullish thesis, is this. We're at the top of the channel. The SBX's had an amazing run. The SBX needs a correction. It's going to be very hard for the SBX to have a correction and for Bitcoin to stay where Bitcoin is. But for now, as I said, I'm bullish and I'm investing and I'm investing in old coins that I want to hold for the next part of the cycle or that I'm happy to hold right into the cycle. I did do a trade in Front Runners yesterday, which again, if you're not part of Front Runners, I really suggest you join at this part of the market. There's a link below. Sign up.

If you're not happy, just write me a mail. I'll refund your money. But there's a trade that I took yesterday that I want you guys to listen to. I don't know if it works. I don't know if you can actually... Okay. So, I can't play the voice note that I played in Front Runners, but here's a thesis. I think privacy money is the biggest trade of 2026 and when you look at the bubbles and you look at what tokens have moved in 2026, just look at the last week. I mean Dash, Monero, and Zcash are the biggest movers basically of the year. Look at the one month privacy coin. Zcash got hit because of the Monero, you know because of the developers walked out and when the developers walked out people divested from Zcash and they invested into Monero. So right now there's a three-step trade that's probably worth taking. The first step is I think Zcash; I think that private money is going to be the biggest narrative of 2026 and I think you need to be invested into private money and therefore you need to make a choice whether you want to invest into Zcash or Monero. Tomorrow I'm going to drop a show on Crypto Insider which tells you which one I invest in and why. The thing here is if you're going to buy Zcash, you also should be buying NEAR. The reason why you want to buy NEAR is because NEAR has got this thing called NEAR Intents. That's what NEAR Intents is. It looks like a DEX, but effectively what it allows you to do is swap from private money to non-private money. In other words, from Zcash, which is private money, to non-private money on-chain, which means that you bypass the whole need to get onto an exchange and reveal your KYC. Now, if you're trading privacy coins, you can't then go onto a KYC exchange and then back onto it because then Fefe is in the thing here. You see, I knew that Fefe actually comes here to get his alpha. I knew he comes to get his alpha. You should tell him to lay out his thesis as well as I've laid out my thesis because here a lot of his people are quite confused. Anyway, going back to the alpha, what happens here is that NEAR Intents is right now the hub where"

You should tell him to lay out his thesis as well as I've laid out my thesis because here a lot of his people are quite confused. Anyway, going back to the alpha, what happens here is that NEAR Intents is right now the hub where people trade from Zcash into ETH and other tokens, Solana, etc., and back into privacy coin. This is almost like the ultimate money laundering operation because you don't actually have to go through... I didn't did I just say that this is the ultimate money laundering operation? Because you are trading from privacy to non-privacy on-chain without a centralized intermediary. So here's the three-step trade, the two-step trade. Number one, buy Zcash and just hold Zcash in your portfolio. But number two, buy NEAR and hold NEAR in your portfolio. Because if Zcash runs, NEAR is also going to run. Look at the chart of NEAR. It hasn't done anything yet. When Zcash starts to run and people realize how powerful NEAR Intents actually is, then this chart is going to turn. You can see it's just started turning, right? You can see and maybe it's even breaking a small cup and handle formation over here. Okay, so the traders, step one and two, you don't need to have guts for. Step three, you need to have guts for. Step three, short Monero if you're scared of market movements. I'm not shorting Monero yet. In fact, I've got quite a long Monero position. So, I want to take that trade actually with you guys. So, I loaded an account on Bybit with um I think this account has got, let me just open the sub-account. Give me one second. Let's just get a sub-account here. Um, do we have margin? Yeah. Yes, we do. Okay. So, I loaded this account. I've got 50 grand in this account. We're going to start together. You can put five grand, 10 grand, or whatever you want. You can do this on Bybit or on Blofin. We'll leave links below with either of the exchanges. If you open an account and you're the first 100 people to open account, you get a free $1,000 trade. But you got to do it today and you got to be the first 100. Now, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go long NEAR and I'm going to go long Zcash. That's the first part of my trade. I'm going to put I'm not going to go crazy margin. I'm not going to go crazy leverage. I'm buying this to hold this for a couple of months. I'm going to take a $20,000 notional"

I'm not going to go crazy leverage. I'm buying this to hold this for a couple of months. I'm going to take a $20,000 notional position, which is 10,000 NEAR. Actually, make it 11,000 just so we know we've taken a notional position. I'm going to do this actually on 5x leverage because I don't want to go crazy leverage. Oh man, I've just been logged out. Oh man, hold on a second. Let me try and log back in. Can't believe they logged me out right in the middle of the show. They logged me out. It's quite rude. It's rude. They shouldn't do that. I mean, somebody phoned Bybit. Okay, I know. I know why that happened. It's because of the VPN stuff. But anyway, let's because you know when you walk into the office, the VPN gets turned off. Let's quickly have a look here. I have to authenticate this account. Okay, so forgive me. I wanted to put through these trades with you guys. I want to actually build this account together. So, open account on Bybit or Blofin. I'm going to open an account on both. For both of them, you get your first $1,000 free trade if you were one of the first hundred. So, here we go. Let's just quickly let me just get into a sub-account here. Uh, okay. Here we go. Okay, I'm in the sub-account. So, and let me try and just get into trades, futures trading. Here we go. Okay, so I'm back in the account. I've got $50,000 of margin in this account. You can trade with me. I'm going to buy some and remember and I'm buying this, I'm not buying this for one week or two weeks. These are not that trade. This is stuff that I'm holding because I really think it's going to do well. I'm going to buy myself 11,000 of these. Um 11,000 of these. There we go. I'm going to do it on a 5x leverage. I'm not going to do 10x. I think 10x is a bit aggressive. Um over there. I'm buying that. I'm going to just buy that at market. I'm not going to mess around for 2 cents. I'm buying this because I really think it's going to work. I'm going to buy myself another $20,000 of Zcash. So the Zcash. Now remember, I'm not buying this to trade this to exit tomorrow. So, that's not the these are trades that we're going into the next part of the cycle with, right?"

Now remember, I'm not buying this to trade this to exit tomorrow. So, that's not the these are trades that we're going into the next part of the cycle with, right? Here I'm going to buy $20,000 worth of that as well, which is 50 units. I'm going to buy it at 420. I'm buying this. The reason why I'm buying I'm also going to buy this at 5x. The reason why I'm buying Zcash is because Zcash was hit hard by the news that developers were walking out. But in the meantime, the developers just were moving to a shell which was a better shell than the one they were in. Okay, so we've got those two positions open. Okay, the next position which I'm actually taking and again I'm not buying these. If they go down 10% tomorrow, don't come and complain because that's not why we're actually buying these things. The next one that I'm buying is Lighter. Why? Because Lighter is one of these tokens that I think is going to do really well, but the airdrop guys have been farming it. So I want to scale into Lighter position. I'm not ready to take the full Lighter position. So I'm going to take half of my Lighter position also at 5x leverage and I'm going to go long. So, I've got three positions that are basically open now. I've got Zcash, I've got NEAR because I believe in the Zcash protocol, and I've got Lighter because I believe in the Perps protocol, and I think that Lighter hasn't had a run. Those are the three trades that I've basically open. Now, you can open the same or similar trades. Just go to and the link below, sign up for Bybit, sign up for Blofin. Blofin is good if you don't want to do KYC. If you're in a country that Bybit doesn't surface, Bybit is a full exchange. For both of them, you get the $50 voucher, which you can open into a $1,000 leverage position if you do it today. And we should probably put in the Front Runners link because there's a lot of trades actually going on. I know the guys caught the KARRAT trade, which was an amazing trade in Front Runners as well, which was fantastic. Okay, so that's it. Listen, you've heard my thesis. You've heard why I'm so bullish. As I'm so bullish, the price has gone up another $1,000. Bitcoin is now trading at 96,500. We're so back, baby. We're so back. I'm very excited to be here"

I'll see you guys again tomorrow. Remember, tomorrow there's a video dropping about Zcash versus Monero, the ultimate ultimate ultimate showdown. See you tomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends."
