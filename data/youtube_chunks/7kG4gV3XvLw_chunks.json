      "text": "A lot of people have been saying that the cryptobubble has popped. Well, what if they're right? What if this was crypto's.com moment? No mania, no parabolic blowoff, no new retail flood. Bitcoin just spent an entire year stuck inside a $50,000 or so range, opening and closing at almost the exact same level. When you look at that candle, it starts to feel like a heartbeat went flat. Now, zoom out into the early 2000s. Everyone believed the internet would change everything until prices collapsed and confidence vanished. The NASDAQ fell over 80%. And most people walked away convinced the dream had died. But something strange has happened while prices sank. Adoption accelerated. The number of internet users went from 400 million to over 4 billion over the next 20 years. That's the question haunting this market right now. What if this quiet sideways stretch is the same phase the internet went through 20 years ago? What if the crypto crash already happened and the foundation gets silently built? By the end of this video, you'll see whether this was really crypto's version of the com bust or whether something entirely different is happening. Either way, understanding it could change how you think about the next 5 years. And again, remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. Every big shift starts with disbelief. People want to call it a bubble. They want a label that makes the pain they feel temporary, and the chart gives them all the ammo they need. Bitcoin's 2025 candle says it loud. The January open came around $93,000, and now it's trading just a few,000 below that. A year later at the same level with a $52,000 or so range from the highs of 126 to a low of $74,000. No conviction in either direction. The kind of year that leaves traders exhausted and investors secondguing what they even believe in. I mean, look around you. Stocks rallied, gold and silver rallied, and Bitcoin. Well, guys, we're back to where we started. After the ETF run up and having hype, the air just left the room. No breakout, no collapse, just quiet distribution. But sometimes what looks like the end is just the pause before something new starts moving. And guys, I feel it all around in the private groups, the traders I'm dealing with, everyone's just kind of done for now with this market. And that's pretty common around the lows of the market. You want to look for when nobody cares. And that seems to be right now. Now, here's where the story breaks. Because if we were in a late cycle collapse, we'd see chaos for sellers, exchange failures, liquidations across the board. Instead, we're seeing something strange. Outflows without panic. Coin shares reported $952 million in net global outflows last week. US products accounted for about 990 million of redemptions, partially offset by inflows elsewhere with Ethereum and Bitcoin leading the US outflows. Ethereum lost 555 million. Bitcoin 460 million. But look closer. Canadian and German funds actually saw inflows 46 million and 15 million. Even Salon and XRP posted gains of 48.5 million and 62.9 million respectively. That is not contagion, guys. That is hesitation. That's US regulatory bottleneck. When regulation hangs in limbo, capital waits on the sidelines. Every headline about cryptoflows, circles back to one thing. Washington still doesn't know who's in charge. The Clarity Act, the bill meant to finally divide power between the SEC and CFTC, has been hanging in limbo for almost a year. It passed the House back in July with bipartisan support. The same week, lawmakers approved the Genius Act, the first federal framework for stable coins, but the Senate stalled again over who regulates what. Now the market is officially set for January 2026. Senators Tim Scott and John Boozeman, chairs of the banking and agriculture committees, confirmed the schedule. And we have the White House cryptozar David Sachs calling it the moment the US finally sets the rules of the road. But still there's friction underneath. Democrats worry the bill gives too much power to the executive branch after the Supreme Court hinted it might overturn a 90-year president that protects agency independence. Senator Cy Booker said outright that he doesn't trust the White House to honor bipartisan appointments. That's a polite way of saying we don't trust the Trump's team to play fair. That tension matters because it freezes progress. Institutions can't scale exposure until they know which regulator they have to answer to. And developers can't design compliance systems if the goalposts keep moving. And while Washington debates, the rest of the world keeps building. Canada approved multiple spot crypto ETFs. Germany and Switzerland rolled out new bankled custody programs."

Germany and Switzerland rolled out new bankled custody programs. Brazil formalized tokenized income products through its central bank. The US used to lead conversations around innovative tech. Now it's holding hearings while everyone else launches products. The irony is that regulators are trying to protect investors, but the uncertainty is what's driving them offshore. And guys, I can tell you firsthand that I'm one of those people dealing with this regular uncertainty right now. If you've been following me closely on my ex accounts and others, you know that I'm working on a new project. And this is one of the things that we're getting from investment bankers right now is what's up with the Clarity Act? What's going on? And all we can do right now is go off the best assumptions that are being told to us by people like Paul Atkins and others. But every market cycle has a moment when conviction disappears. That's what the early 2000s felt like for tech investors. A slow bleed after a decade of euphoria. The NASDAQ fell 80% from its peak. Venture funding froze and the internet felt like a bad idea that got too big too fast. And yet, even as prices collapsed, something else kept growing underneath. The number of internet users doubled. Infrastructure quietly advanced. The winners that would define the next 20 years, Amazon, Google, eBay, PayPal, were being built during the boredom. Crypto feels like that again. Price action looks numb. Retail engagement is near record lows. Google search interest for Bitcoin is at quiet as it's been in over 5 years. But network activity keeps ticking up. Lightning transactions, stable coin transfers, tokenized treasuries, all running quietly in the background while most people have tuned out. This is the same rhythm the internet went through after its crash. The speculation wave crashed into reality, but the usage curve didn't stop rising. Investors like SJ Dick and Santiago Royale have started claiming it is the crypto.com phase. Their thesis is simple. Bitcoin is the monetary backbone, the gold layer. While all coins play the role of early tech stocks, Bitcoin evolves slowly, absorbing trust. All coins sprint, fail, iterate, and sometimes reinvent themselves entirely. That separation matters because it explains why Bitcoin feels stable while everything else feels very chaotic. Back in 2001, people called the internet a fad. By 2007, it was the infrastructure. If history rhymes, this isn't the ending. It's the consolidation period before the next expansion. The quiet decade where credibility replaces hype. But if you know anything about crypto, you know that our markets move at lightear speed compared to every other market. So I don't think we'd have to wait so long. Because if you ask me, it feels like we've gone through several boom and bust. All pretty equivalent to the dot bust because we've had all these crazy altcoins run up. Everyone was speculating like crazy. 2017 we iterated. 2021 we iterated. And now we have today. And if you only watch the charts, you think the story ended. But the number under the surface tells a different one. The biggest players in finance didn't exist. They adopted. Black Rockck's iShares Bitcoin ETF became the most successful exchange traded product launch in history, pulling in billions in assets within months of approval. Together, crypto ETFs manage now over $175 billion in exposure. Capital that didn't exist in prior cycles. Here's the part that nobody can dismiss. If crypto were dying, usage wouldn't be exploding. Think about that for a second. Stable coins are the clearest example. According to A16Z's state of crypto 2025 report, total stable coin transaction volume reached $46 trillion this year, even after filtering out bot activity and artificial wash flows. Real usage still landed near $9 trillion, almost half of what Visa processes annually. Guys, think about that for a second."

Real usage still landed near $9 trillion, almost half of what Visa processes annually. Guys, think about that for a second. A technology that once was dismissed as speculative now moves in the same scale of money as one of the largest payment networks in the world. And it's not happening in New York or London first. It's happening in Sa Paulo in Logos in Mania. In Brazil, younger investors are leading the shift. The country's largest exchange, Marcato Bitcoin, reported that participation among investors under 24 years old rose 56% year-over-year. and its digital fixed income platform distributed 1.8 billion realale. That's about $325 million USD in tokenized income products this year. Their savings accounts built on chain stable income generating assets tied to realworld yield. This is what a quiet revolution looks like. Users stop choosing volatility and start using the system for everyday stability. All right, guys. Now, real quick, just a quick break. You worked hard to protect your crypto and your data. Guys, said this before, don't be a dumb dumb and let one bad click undo it. NordVPN is the first line of defense. It hides your IP, encrypts your data, and keeps you one step ahead of scammers and trackers. And here's a pro tip. Literally, I showed you guys when I did it before on a video, I saved over $300 on my last trip. Most people never realize they're being overcharged simply because where their IP location is or where they where they live. So guys, it's a no-brainer here. Protect your portfolio. Unlock the full web wherever you are and save while you're at it. There's a link in the description, guys, to get four free months and over 70% off. They cost less than a cup of coffee every single month. Less than one cup for the entire month. How like how is that not so obvious? So don't wait for a hack or security breach or data brokers or whatever to to reach you through leaked data, these kind of things. So guys, hit that link in the description to get up to 4 months free and over 70% off. Don't wait for the hack to learn the hard way. Use Nord like I do. Stay private, stay protected, and stay ahead. And now back to the show. Will crypto traders argue whether crypto is dead? Massive blockchain payment networks quietly went online. The biggest shift of 2025 wasn't a new token or a price breakout. It was the world's largest payment companies deciding to move real money on chain. Visa now settles transactions in USDC. The dollarback stable coin issued by Circle using Salana as infrastructure. That means funds can move across borders in seconds, 7 days a week. No banking hours, no weekend delays. Visa isn't testing this in a sandbox. It's live. They're even serving as a validator on Salana and acting as a design partner for Circle's new layer 1, ARC, built to support commercial activity directly on chain. That move quietly rewrote how value moves through the global system. The same credit card networks that once relied on delayed settlements can now close the loop in real time. And Visa, guys, isn't alone. The Federal Reserve took its own step toward modernization by proposing a limited version of the payment accounts that traditional banks use. What Governor Christopher Waller nicknamed the skinny master account. These accounts would allow certain institutions, potentially including crypto-related firms, to clear and settle directly through the Fed's internal payment system without the privileges of a full master account. Waller said it plainly. This request for information is a first step to ensure the Fed keeps up with how payments are evolving. But not everyone in Congress shares his opinion. Of course, his colleague Michael Bar, the former vice chairman for supervision, disagreed, warning it could expose the system to risk if unsupervised crypto companies gained access. That debate reveals how fast the ground is shifting."

Of course, his colleague Michael Bar, the former vice chairman for supervision, disagreed, warning it could expose the system to risk if unsupervised crypto companies gained access. That debate reveals how fast the ground is shifting. Even the most conservative institutions are being forced to decide. adapt to blockchain settlements or fall behind. Every revolution reaches a moment when the old guard decides to join it. Not because they want to, but because they have to. That's what's happening right now. The legacy giants of global finance, DTCC, Swift, Visa, Stripe, PayPal, and Wall Street giants like JP Morgan are all embracing tokenization and blockchain settlements. They publish press releases filled with words like innovation and realtime settlements. But underneath the story isn't about progress, it's about survival. Omid Min, one of the earliest institutional crypto educators, described it perfectly when he said, \"These firms are walking into a technology that will eventually make parts of their own business obsolete.\" The DTCC, America's Central Securities Depository, plans to tokenize US equities that currently sit on its own subsidiaries. That might sound efficient, but it also raises a paradox. If securities can be issued directly on chain, who needs a centralized clearing house at all? Swift, the world's largest financial messenger, faces the same problem. For decades, its network connected correspondent banks across borders. Now, stable coins do the same job instantly. And the payment is the message. Visa's core business, credit card processing, relies on the delay between payment authorization and actual settlement. But if stable coins deliver finality instantly, what happens to those fees? Even PayPal's business model built around charging merchants for closed loop transfers gets crushed when those users move value peer-to-peer through tokens that already yield interest. That's the innovator's dilemma. The same forces driving growth are eroding their profit margins. They're trying to capture the upside of blockchain without giving up the control that blockchains remove. So they build permission versions of public networks. Tokenization without transparency. Decentralization without freedom. And that's where the tension lives. This isn't just a competition for market share. It's a fight over who gets to define what onchain really means. So guys, was this the crash? If you define a bubble by hype, by leverage, by wild promises that outgrew reality, that part probably ended. It ended when the casino mindset died and the easy money vanished. What's left now isn't a bubble. It's a rebuild. This is the quiet part of the story that no one pays attention to while it's happening. It's the same phase the internet went through after the crash. The silence before infrastructure took over in 2003. Nobody was excited at all about TCPIP, but those protocols built the foundation for everything that came next. Crypto is going through the same transformation from narrative to necessity. The difference now is that this system doesn't exist on the sidelines. It's already inside the machinery of global finance. Stable coins move like payment networks. Bitcoin trades like macro collateral. and the institutions that once tried to fight it are quietly integrating it into their core systems. That's what makes this phase so powerful. The audience got smaller, but the foundation got stronger. The noise stopped, but the architecture went live. We're entering the stage where crypto stops being a story and starts becoming infrastructure. The invisible layer powering the next economy. It's the part of every technological cycle that feels boring until hindsight makes it obvious. All right, guys. If you enjoyed that, do me a favor and destroy the like button. If you're new to the channel, what's up? My name is Kyle. And guys, until next time, stay sharp. Stack your Satoshi's and I'll catch you guys in the next one. And also, it's the holidays coming up. I hope that you guys enjoy the holidays very, very much. I'm going to be taking some time off as well. I might do one or two more videos over the next week, week and a half. So, stay tuned for those. I'll make sure to update you guys."
