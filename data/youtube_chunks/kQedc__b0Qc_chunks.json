      "text": "Yo, welcome everyone. It's unfortunately happening again. Bitcoin has gotten a rejection and is now pushing lower. So, let's talk about a potential bearish and also a bullish scenario. Now, first you're going to see we are right now getting a push towards downside exactly after taking the liquidity above our recent high at $94,500. And also remember one thing that we were mentioning in our previous video. The bearish indication you should really pay attention to is going to be if Bitcoin does get the acceptance below the value area high. And if we start going below this specific level below approximately $92,000, it is going to be a bearish indication for Bitcoin. And in this scenario, we are definitely going to look for lower targets. And also right here, you might even be interested to find another short oral trade. And of course, I did follow my plan. And right now, I am in a brand new short trade on Bitcoin from approximately 92,000 US area. Also, I am holding a brand new short trade on Ethereum as well. But also, additionally, I do remain in my long trade on Bitcoin and also in the long trade on XRP. Later in the video, I'm going to share with you also the bullish scenario we can be paying attention to because a lot of different indicators, MACD, money flow, and also the RSI are looking very nice and bullish. But it also does look like when you pay attention right now to the past 24-hour liquidations, over 418 million of long trades completely wrecked and completely liquidated. Right now on the entire move down it really does look like people are already getting stopped out from their long trades which technically speaking it is going to be some kind of a bullish Bitcoin indication. However, first of all right now I want to share with you a bearish scenario. What if we are going to continue dumping even lower towards downside and I mean below $80,000 right here. And also then we need to talk about a bullish scenario. But remember for the past few days we have been talking about a bigger fivewave price structure towards downside. And right now what we can say okay Bitcoin finished the first impulse right here we got a correction then another impulse right here and right now if we go lower it is going to be the completed fourth wave before we are going to be expecting another major impulse back towards upside. In this scenario, the targets are going to be very low, at least below $80,000 right here, or actually very very likely for Bitcoin to then also go below this specific low, below $75,000. And only after we are going to be taking the liquidity below both of the lows. We might be expecting a bigger bounce back towards the upside, maybe even above $100,000. And why we can right now see that potentially the fourth Ali favorite"

And only after we are going to be taking the liquidity below both of the lows. We might be expecting a bigger bounce back towards the upside, maybe even above $100,000. And why we can right now see that potentially the fourth Ali favorite here is right now actually finished. Remember from my previous video where we talked about some kind of a three-wave price structure. You can write to see Bitcoin right here got a push up, push down and another push up. Some kind of a three-wave price structure also right here A B C. And also right now with the entire push up, we can say another A B C correction. And with all of those three ABC corrections combined, we definitely can write to say, okay, Bitcoin potentially right now finished some kind of the elid double combo wave or a complex correction. That being said, our W, our X-wave right here and also potentially a Y-wave. So if we are going to continue lower, definitely I do think our WXY correction is right here finished and we are going to look for much lower price targets literally in the upcoming days. That is why again I really want to be in my short trade in a case the entire crypto market is going to get a major push towards upside. However, we also rightly need to talk about a bullish scenario. And before we do so, I would really appreciate for you to smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible. And also, of course, thank you for subscribing to the channel. Right now, let's talk about at what area is Bitcoin trading at this specific time because it's really not a random level. So what we are going to do remember what is usually the most important Fibonacci ratio of them all. It is always going to be the gold pocket. We are going to go from this exact low back towards this exact high. And you can right to see only a few hours ago we hit our golden Fibonacci ratio to the exact dollar accuracy. Additionally, let's go right now with our anchored VWAP and we are going to anchor it exactly at this specific low. I'm not even joking. You're going to see the anchored VWAP as well. It was hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy. But also, let's go right now on the Bitcoin semi future chart where we are right now going to see our first semi gap at approximately $9,500 is right now fully filled. And this right here, it is actually going to be some kind of"

But also, let's go right now on the Bitcoin semi future chart where we are right now going to see our first semi gap at approximately $9,500 is right now fully filled. And this right here, it is actually going to be some kind of a bullish Bitcoin indication. However, you can also right now see another CI gap is still going to be at approximately $88,000. But of course, all of the semi gaps usually do have approximately 90% chance of getting filled sooner rather than later. And yes, if Bitcoin right now is going to go even lower for sure, we still do have a beautiful support level just slightly below us. And what is the support level going to be? Let's go right now with our high time frame areas of support. You can notice our weekly and the daily high from time frame support levels very very close towards our semi gap that is going to be closed at approximately $88,000. But also right here at our weekly and our daily we can identify another very important volume level. Let's go right now and measure the entire bottom price action with volume where you can right now see the point of control or the biggest volume cluster coming in almost exactly at both of our weekly and the daily levels right here. So definitely if Bitcoin right now does continue even lower, we do have beautiful support levels below us. Yes, at the moment we are already trading at a very nice support level. But also even if we do go lower, we do have the weekly and the daily aligning with our point of control. And even if we are going to go even lower right here, we do have our recent low, another low, another low, and also then the fourth low in a row. So it also means a lot of liquidity exactly below all of our recent lows and also a beautiful support level. It's actually right now very hard to say at what level is Bitcoin potentially going to get a bounce off of. Are we going to get a bounce at our gold Fibonacci ratio? Are we going to go even lower, fill our lower semicap right here and then get a bounce or maybe even is Bitcoin going to go even lower and take the liquidity below our recent lows. So definitely in the upcoming days, Bitcoin is going to show us the direction that we are probably going to move next. And yes, of course, if you are in my free VIP Discord group, yesterday I posted something very, very important because I"

So definitely in the upcoming days, Bitcoin is going to show us the direction that we are probably going to move next. And yes, of course, if you are in my free VIP Discord group, yesterday I posted something very, very important because I actually mentioned right here, this remains the best trading setup. So, I still do think if Bitcoin is going to go higher and actually hit our bigger golden Fibonacci ratio at approximately 97 and $98,000, we definitely can still be interested to fire another short trade. But the only question is are we going to actually be able to get another major bounce toward the upside at some kind of the support area where we are trading as right now or just slightly lower. So because usually I don't really like guessing. I simply follow my very simple plan and as we said in our previous video acceptance below the value area high bearish indication I don't really care if we are going to right to be hitting the co pocket the weekly or the liquidity level. I simply am going to fire a brand new short trade on Bitcoin and also on Ethereum. But also I am not right now closing my long trades on BTC and also an XRP right here simply because potentially we might even get a bullish indication that I am going to share it with you literally in the upcoming minutes. Right now first of all let's also go with the RSI money flow and also the MACD indicator on the 4hour time frame because all of those indicators right also are being slightly more bullish. What you can write to see the RSI it is getting right here a brand new lower low also money flow another lower low also MACD right here another lower low but we are not even done yet what if we go and pay attention to the CV indicator right here Bitcoin is forming a higher low for the past few days right here but also on the CV indicator we are getting another lower low so this right here is actually also going to be another bullish Bitcoin indication so with all of those things, the bullish CVD divergence right here, the bullish indications on the RSI, on the money flow, knowing that Bitcoin filled also the CM gap right here. Yes, sure, we can still get another push down right here. Ideally, I would still like to see another push towards the upside for us to go towards our golden Fibonacci ratio at approximately $98,000. And that is right now why if you want to trade"

So of course if you really want those bonuses and want to trade with us create an account on Bybe with the first thing down below in the description right now. Let's also talk about what is going to be the absolute bullish Bitcoin indication we would really like to get. Let's go right now once again with our fixed range volume profile to measure the entire bottom price action. Again, I am going to follow a very simple rule below our value area high. We are slightly more bearish looking potentially for our lower areas of support to actually get heat. But of course, if Bitcoin is going to be able to reclaim our value area high bullish indication of Bitcoin in this scenario, definitely I'm going to look for our major golden Fibonacci ratio at $98,000 area. So the plan on Bitcoin right now is staying very very simple. Ideally, right now we are looking for another bounce toward the upside from the area where we are, maybe even slightly lower if Bitcoin is then going to attack our lower SIM gap. Again, the RSI, the money flow, and also the MACD indicator are right now already having a setup for a hidden bullish divergence. It's not confirmed just yet, but definitely once this one is going to start curving towards the upside on the 4hourly, it is going to be a confirmed hidden bullish divergence on MACD money flow and also on the RSI. Now, let me also go with the exponential moving averages because with all of them, at least as right now, we are still in an uptrend. On the 4hourly 50 is above 200 EMA. This right here is showing to us we are moving in an average uptrend. Also on the 2-hourly we are moving in an average uptrend. On the 1 hourly we are also at least as of right now still moving in an average uptrend. So with all of the EMAs they"

On the 1 hourly we are also at least as of right now still moving in an average uptrend. So with all of the EMAs they are right to being slightly more bullish. So probably right you're wondering how can I right now approach a chart for me to fire another long or buy trade. Personally, I usually like to have stop losses set slightly more tight. That being said, if you're right now looking for another buy trade exactly at the gold Fibonacci ratio where we are as right now, all you have to do right here is to set a stop-loss slightly below the gold Fibonacci ratio, literally targeting another higher high. In a case, Bitcoin is going to go lower. Of course, you can get stopped out of your long trade, but then simply look to re-enter the trade if the trade is still going to be valid slightly lower at our next support area at the weekly and also the daily. But of course, if we are then going to go even lower, take the liquidity below all of our recent lows and only then to get a reaction towards the upside. This, of course, is also going to be another trading setup where we can be looking for a long trade on Bitcoin, setting the stop loss below the recent low. However, this right here could potentially become a problem if we are going to go that low because potentially we might be then invalidating our hidden bullish divergences on the MACD on the RSI or even money flow. So to be honest, right now ideally we are looking for a bounce sooner rather than later on Bitcoin maybe from the area where we are already right now or potentially after filling the semi gap just slightly lower. Then of course we are going to see if potentially Bitcoin is then going to hit our bigger gold Fibonacci ratio and get a major push towards the upside towards approximately $98,000 US area.
