      "text": "[music] low time frame. We have a little bit of a bounce in play. Some of the trades that we had previously been looking at are now starting to break out. One of which is Monero. If you have a look over here on the banter bubbles up 19%. This has been one of the top trades that we've been focused on for the last couple of weeks and months actually since last year we had that trade open. Uh now breaking out. I think we up over like 40 50% just in terms of a price move. Uh gold as well breaking out to new highs. We have silver new alltime highs as well. We'll have a look at the stock market. There's a whole bunch of trade opportunities today. So, smash the like button. Let's get straight into the show content. What we're going to begin off with over here is of course just having a look at that gold trade which has been one of the main positions that we've held as well. Uh you can see over here breaking out of that ascending triangle which also comes off of a previous big bullish move. So, you can view this as a bullish uh penant, a bull flag, whatever it is you want to call it. It's basically rinse and repeat, right? Big move up, consolidates, tightens, big move up, consolidates, tightens, and big move up. Right? So, [clears throat] we are in that environment for gold to accelerate higher. And the targets that I'm looking at at least for the first take-profit is going to be 4,686. They are marked off with those yellow lines. If you look in the right hand margin over here, you can see exactly where we're planning to take some profit. So TP1, TP2, and finally TP3 at 5,000 for gold. So looking really, really good over there. Silver as well accelerating the gains, but not really positioned over here because I feel like it's moved a lot. And if you have been in this trade, it's more of a profit taking opportunity. So maybe we'll get a little bit of a rotation out of silver. Profit taking from silver, rotated into gold, and then we should see some high prices over there. And then we have as well platinum just consolidating over here prepping for that next move up. And I believe that this one should quite easily make it over here. For anyone that has missed out on these, right? Um you could pretty much create a trade setup just like this. These lows should hold over here. If you do break below those lows, I would invalidate and I'd be looking at the move further down back to test 1900, which is your range high breakout level on a multi-year uh basis, right? A multi-year pattern over there. And then you're looking at your extension up over here for 28% price move. That's giving you a valid 2.76 to1 risk-to-reward ratio. So for anyone that's getting a little bit of FOMO, maybe you've missed out on some of the other trades, maybe you knew, you've just joined in now recently. Um here's an opportunity for you, right? You'd be looking at something like that using the daily as a guide. Remember when looking at the metals, of course you can trade this on the lower time frames. One of our traders actually in whail room is consistently smashing it on gold um with low time frame trades. But that's not really my forte or skill set. I prefer prefer to position with size in uh spot positions or very low leverage positions and then I just hold that on my brokerage account and off it goes. So I get a lot of requests as well by the way from you guys. Where can you trade these things? Remember you can trade these on BTCC. There is a link in the description below. If you click on that link over here, um they're giving you a 10% sign up bonus. But more importantly than that, at least what means more to me is to lower the trading fees. So 40% off on trading fees if you use that particular link. That is specially arranged for you guys over there. And you're getting up to $10,000. So you can trade gold, silver, um platinum, and then we'll have a look at copper as well. Copper I need to show you on the weekly time frame. This is also breaking out of a huge cup and handle formation. There it is. Big cup and handle formation. And I believe that copper could also accelerate those gains up to $8. So, we'll review these each and every single week when relevant."

Copper I need to show you on the weekly time frame. This is also breaking out of a huge cup and handle formation. There it is. Big cup and handle formation. And I believe that copper could also accelerate those gains up to $8. So, we'll review these each and every single week when relevant. Sometimes even every single day. Right now, it is relevant and they continuing up. And then we have over here um the S&P 500. I have a stock trade for you guys today as well. If you want that, do go and smash the like button. It really helps us to get the show content out. While you are voting on the poll as well. Smash the like button. Let me know what you think comes first for Bitcoin. $80,000 or $12,000. If you look at the poll results today, very very evenly split, right? 4060. Not bad. 4060 because we trending up on the low time frames. I guess a few more people think 102 is coming first. Remember 102,000 is a valid target, right? There is a draw of liquidity over there. Um that would be a bearish retest as well of some of those bearish order blocks. So in terms of relief rally, that's absolutely possible. But um you know uh longing into resistance is never never uh really advised. So while you smash the like button, let's continue over there and we'll get into that stock trade that I have for you today which you guys can take over here as well. So that will be for the NASDAQ. So the S&P 500 accelerating those gains. All in all, that looks good. Dow Jones accelerating those gains, higher highs, high lows, new alltime highs for Dow Jones. And remember, we said last week, pay attention to the NASDAQ, which is lagging. So the tech sector is lagging. Now could this round over? Could this round over like this and collapse? Of course, it's possible. But we said that the probabilities do begin to shift in favor of the bulls if you can start to break this down sloping trend line. And we've been holding this level over here as support at that 608 to 612 level, which is at least one good sign. So very similar to gold. Um you know, some may view this as a bit of a bullish pendant over here. Big move up. That's your pull leading into the pen and squeezing. Maybe it's breaking out early over here and you're going to be looking at that acceleration at the end of the day. We want to focus on where is that invalidation. And what I previously outlined to you guys uh leading into the end of last week was this was the level to watch for. Right? Basically, as long as you don't break below this candle, you can remain long over here on the NASDAQ and you can accelerate higher taking out those all-time highs probably giving you about a 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio. So therefore, um, let me just quickly see, did we save it over here? Uh, we didn't save it yet in terms of the risk-to-reward tool, but I'll quickly pull it up again. Um, let's grab that over there. Long position tool. Now, you're going to have to invalidate a little bit closer. If this is the acceleration you want this to go right now, you basically don't want to drop below Thursday's low. So, previously, this was your invalidation. Now, I would say invalidate under Thursday's low because you're breaking back below that trend line. Getting a close over here above this down sloping trend line today for the Nasdaq will be really good and lead to possible acceleration. Maybe there's a bit of a narrative building over here. What would that narrative be? In case you guys missed it, it just came in that um they're trying to put criminal charges against the uh federal chair Jerome Pal. And that's absolutely crazy. Basically Trump is saying that he's not lowering interest rates. So they basically found dirt on him and they're going after him."

Basically Trump is saying that he's not lowering interest rates. So they basically found dirt on him and they're going after him. So for the first time in a long time, Jerome Pal's come out and basically shown the middle finger and saying that he is not stopping, right? He's sticking to the cause, but some believe they're going to lower interest rates, which may be good for the markets. And I guess that's currently being priced in. So Jerome Pal fighting back for the first time. Remember he's remained silent with all the criticism. Remember that Trump kept bullying him, calling him too slow pal, right? too slow pal over and over again. And when they asked Jerome Pal to respond on that, he said, \"I don't have any response or comment. I'm just doing my job.\" Well, for the first time, he came out with this video over here um giving his comments and basically saying that, you know, they they they're just attacking him for doing his job and trying to find other stuff on him. So, nevertheless, that's one thing that we're looking at. So, basically, just back to those highs over there is going to give you a 1.17 to1 risk-to-reward ratio. Of course, that's not good enough. You got to target at least 3:1 risk-to-reward ratio. And I believe you should easily take out those highs. If you can even get three candle closes above this trend line, you should get that acceleration. So, that's one of the main things. We have a few more things we must look at when it comes to the rest of the stock market because we're still in that Apple short trade. And I'm actually pulling this up as well for the first time. So, let's see where we at. Uh, Apple short trade. I said to you guys on Friday uh or on Thursday was my last video because I was flying on Friday. You can see back in the home studio over here which is absolutely wonderful. It's good to be back profit taking environment. I believe there's a good chance that Apple will bounce from here but I think that Apple will struggle to get back above this breakdown level which is in this zone over here. That is your bearish order block that led to the the breakdown. But you could full retrace. So if you took a short trade which I'm in the short trade over here we have a couple. We have the Apple short trade, Monero long trade, gold long trade and Micro Strategy short trade. Those are some of the positions that we're in. I'm holding that short. Um, but I will be covering some of that position. You've already completed almost 50% of the intended move over here. So, feel free to close, you know, anywhere between 25 and 50% of your position. It's up to you. I'm not here to, you know, click the buttons for you guys. You decide on that. I'm just giving you the general directional bias and showing you what I'm doing. But, um, a little bit of profit taking is probably warranted on Apple over there. Tesla was the other one we said coming into a very very key critical area. And I do want to remind you guys, you can trade all of these things on BTCC, right? Everything I'm covering for the stocks, commodities, um, as well as, uh, indices, and even forex pairs can all be traded over there. So, let's go to Tesla. Tesla also coming into a very key area. This was the long trade over here. Testing that key support. You know, if you miss that long trade, this is probably now your next best opportunity because you have an absolutely clear, beautiful invalidation underneath those lows. You could spike down one more time. The real invalidation is probably below these lows. But I obviously would want to stop out very early."

You could spike down one more time. The real invalidation is probably below these lows. But I obviously would want to stop out very early. If um if I missed this trade and I was only getting in now and then you'd be looking at something like that. So, what I'll do is I'll just quickly slide this one over to the left and then you'll have this one as a new setup. So, um it's a bit preemptive. You should probably wait for a bit more of this um chart to develop because you could probably easily just spike down one more time. But is it worth trying to um you know get into this early? Is it worth trying to get into this early now? I do believe it is because your risk is only 6.3% for this Tesla trade which is absolutely not bad. And this is very similar to what we took on Monero. Let me actually go to Monero. We we've put these side by side as comparatives, right? So, we had Tesla trading over here at around that 400ish level and the target is 720. And then if we just very quickly go over here to the daily chart and we'll go on to Monero. That was the trade setup. It was also trading around that 400ish level. Started to break out. And where are we targeting around that 720, right? 733. So, very, very, very similar in terms of um the actual price move over there. All righty. So, we've got that covered. Quick look at Google accelerating further, but lot of liquidity built up. I wouldn't want to be long on on Google. Unless I long from way earlier and I'm just trailing the stop loss. If you are long on Google, probably trail that stop loss over there. Uh we'll go to Nvidia. Nvidia still chopping about. So, no real commentary over there. Meta's all over the place. Microsoft, I think, can still come down to to 409. Uh Amazon, uh it's okay. It's it's now recaptured this level over here. Test point one, two, three. Fourth time breakout, failed, came back down, re um captured this. So, probably going to make a move up to about 280. And then let's have a look at the cryptoreated uh sector when it comes to stock. So, Coinbase, you know, needs to find support within this region over here. If it fails at this 220 region, it's going to take a bit more time. A little bit more chop and reaccumulation will be needed. But if it fails there, watch out below for about 170 circle. Uh that's the USDC stable coin company basically still bearish, but it's put um in a bit of a bottoming formation over here trying to reaccumulate. I wouldn't go long over here, though. I'll just leave that. Keep it on the watch list. Robin Hood also reaccumulating. Looks similar to Nvidia, right? Look at that in Nvidia chopping about. Robin Hood chopping about as well at this key level. Give it a bit of time. And then we have Micah Shaji. Uh, you know, I mean, we took 75% profit, but this thing's probably going to make another move down to about 135. So, that is it for commodities, stocks, and uh, some of the indices over there. Let's get into crypto. Crypto, we've been following the return on investment for bare markets, right? So, how quickly things accelerate towards the downside. We're currently following the purple trajectory over there and it looks pretty similar. Everything is still following pretty similar but I wanted to dive into that all a little bit further. Right? So if you have a look at this, you expect that the bare market dips or at least the draw downs um we can't really call it a dip. It's more crash. The bare market crashes and draw downs become less and less severe over time."

So if you have a look at this, you expect that the bare market dips or at least the draw downs um we can't really call it a dip. It's more crash. The bare market crashes and draw downs become less and less severe over time. So if you have a look at the first one, 93% draw down. 93% draw down. Huge. Uh obviously a much low market cap as an asset class. You could hardly have even called it an asset class back then. Purely speculative, big gamble. So big draw downs of course huge upside and huge downside. 2013 to 2015 83%. Look at 2017 to 2018 bare market 83%. Very very very similar. Right? 2021 76% down. 2025 so far. Well, 32% draw down. So, what are some potential draw down targets? Now, you'll remember that I've outlined to you guys before way back when first when price first started to distribute um and we started to to break down from that 126k level. I said if 126,000 is in fact the all-time high for the cycle, I would be targeting the 0.786 to the 0.886 fib retracement, which takes you between 30,000 and $40,000 as a price target. Now, how would that line up in terms of a percentage draw down? I thought this was a good angle to look at, which is um this chart over here from who used to be called Tony the Bull, but I see he changed it now to Tony Severino because he's no longer a bull, right? And he's got a CMT, which means that he's done a course, right? He he he knows a bit over here. So, interesting stuff, right? If you have a look over here at the Ichimoku cloud, when you get a bearish cross, which is what you've officially just got on the weekly time frame, what you typically see is around a 68% draw down from the point of the cross, right? So 67.95 or 67.97 in the first um bare market correction, 67.97 in the second one. Exactly. Remember from the points of the cross, that's where price finds its bottom. 67.97. Now this is something that is not got diminishing returns in the sense of yes price has those diminishing uh diminishing draw downs I should say and diminishing returns but this over here is exactly 67.97% from the cross each time 1 2 3 this would be the fourth data point. So where would that play place price? Right? If that did happen, that means that price would draw down 77% as opposed to the price cycle was 76%. Right? So that puts price at $33,000, which is in that zone, right? In that target zone that I also have for a major major bottom. What he's also outlined over here is that the Ichimoku projects um 26 periods ahead. So it means that we are over 150 days away from price reaching uh the twist time-wise, right? So basically what you can be looking at is very very very similar to the price cycles. It would take you into about October of this year where you'd find your major bottom for the market. So I just found that incredibly interesting. More on crypto, there's a lot of important updates coming into play. Uh we have the um Senate voting for the clarity act and that's coming on the 15th which is three days from now. Uh remember it looks at the rule book which aims for killing fake volume. This is a massive thing in the market. Look at things like for example Pippen. Let's quickly go to Pippen. Pippen is one of these things where you get these random pumps out of nowhere and they can basically like you know crook the books if if you will fake volume uh fake buying pressure and they control the market. They have 99.9999% of the supply. Not necessarily pointing out that coin. That's just one example. We've seen this about a thousand times. They'll ban wash trading, which is also part of the uh criminal things that go on within crypto."

They'll ban wash trading, which is also part of the uh criminal things that go on within crypto. And then prohibiting shady reserve practices, which will be good for our risk control as a sector, which means that hopefully we don't get those 10 uh the 10th of October liquidation like events where many coins went to zero in 2025. Can you guys believe that? I mean, I expected that stuff for like 2013, 14, 15, even into 2017, but the year 2025 and you still had coins hitting zero there. So, they're voting on that and we'll see if anything um noteworthy comes out. So, let's get into Bitcoin. Still below the 21 EMA, still below the 50 EMA. They are going to inevitably cross. Sometimes you find price pull back into the zone like a magnet as the bearish cross is about to take place. So, don't be surprised if that relief rally does continue up to about that 97 to $98,000 region and then that would be what they call the kiss of death, right? As you hit that level, you kiss it and you reject and you come back down further to continue your downward trajectory. So, one thing to consider until you can get back above this 21 EMA, um it is very very risky for investors at least to be long, for swing traders to be long on the market. You're better off looking for shorter term trades. So, uh, we'll have a look over here at the dashboard. Uh, long to short ratio. We got slightly more shorts that are building up over here. It's a negative skew of 1.69, but it's pretty insignificant at the moment. Fi and greed at 27. Uh, we got the funding rates over here slightly short. So, in agreement with exactly what we have written on the top over there. Uh, liquidations very, very, very low, only 144.45 million, which means it's very easy to move the market in this low volume environment. And therefore any rallies in a low volume environment should be treated with the utmost respect and caution because you could get wrecked in that environment. Daily exchange volume starting to roll over. We'll only get more information on this um what prints every day. But the real picture is only weekly where we can start to see is this going to start to fail um over here. ETF flows on BTC and ETH for the weekly back into the negative. So outflowing once again over there. Um what else? What else have we got over here? Anything else important that we need to consider? Let me quickly check the economic calendar because I haven't had a look at that. Uh what do we have coming up this week on the 13th? Um we have some CPI data. Is that correct? CPI data, retail sales, home sales, jobless claims. So there is some stuff coming out this week. Uh we'll see if that shakes things up or not. That is the main thing. And maybe I want to quickly have a look as well what's going on with that hyperlquid whale. He's holding a massive short trade. Um is he still doing that? Is he still holding that short trade? He is $2.74 billion short position on ETH over here. And the highest risk position is some lunatic that is long with almost $12 million on on unis swap. Insane. Uh I don't know what these people are thinking, but they have the money. So we'll see if they're going to win it or lose it. Moving on. Let's get into the rest of the charts for Bitcoin and then we'll have a look at a couple of the altcoins over here. So, uh, Ballinger bands squeezing in very tightly. Look at the top and the bottom contracting. So, you're probably going to start to form a very tight trading range."

Look at the top and the bottom contracting. So, you're probably going to start to form a very tight trading range. If that tight trading range happens, um, you know, to coincide with the what I told you is going to be the kiss of death over here. Then you want to be really really cautious, which means you can continue that grind up. A lot of excitement will come back into the market, especially if you test that 100k region. the psychological six-digit number that people will say back above 100K, right? It sounds much better than below 100K, which is only five digits. But if you do get that while this is contracting in and squeezing aggressively, I'd expect a tight trading range to form and that's probably unfortunately going to lead to the next downside move. Um I won't count the chickens before they hatch, but we have to be cognizant and aware of all these various different things which is showing us extremely low volatility. The volatility is falling off a cliff and that's totally in alignment with what we just looked at over here on the daily exchange volume dropping off um as well as very very very low liquidation level. So something to be aware of over there. Um going on to the deltas over here for specifically high block capital. Um you know negative on on ETH. So negative on ETH that that whale could be in trouble over there if that's negative. Salana positive BTC positive and then the rest of them are negative. Here we have Sonic um Suie and AA which are negative over there. Liquidity is building below price. $89,000 would be the level to hit. 70 million it's not that high. It's only Monday. Let's let that build up a bit. Not much to comment over there. Uh volume is falling, right? Volume is falling while price is rising. Big warning sign potential bare flag that will drop you down towards the 60K region. Okay, so that's where we need to be careful. We need to be careful. As this contracts, you form a tighter and tighter trading range whilst price comes into some of these key levels. If it can break above this volume point of control, which is your green line at 95K, 95,280 to be precise, great. That will be good. Um, for a possible reversal, but otherwise, I have to treat this still as more bearish than bullish. I also have to treat this as more bullish than bearish because this looks like it's trying to reaccumulate and apply pressure into the resistance line. This being USDT dominance. USDT dominance. If this trades with one single candle closing above 6.395%, expect that the bare flag is breaking down and this is going to accelerate into this yellow box above. Okay. Uh unfortunately that is the reality. So if this closes a single candle above the white line over here, expect this to happen which means the bare flag will be breaking down over here on Bitcoin. Um and it is what it is. Okay. Price is attempting to hold the pivot level over here. You can see a little bit of sell pressure coming in right now. Um, you know, it does look like there's potential for a high low to form. It's good news that you're closing multiple candles. You've got one, two, three, four, and now working on your fifth candle above that 50 EMA. That's great, but it's just not enough personally for me to to go long off of because I'll just be longing directly into resistance. So, as per probabilities, this is still very high risk for me. we rejected short-term rejection off of that initial uh 50% level, the main 50% level and resistance is coming into play over here. So, this is your cluster of massive resistance between that 200 EMA which is downtrending and that main key 50% level."

So, this is your cluster of massive resistance between that 200 EMA which is downtrending and that main key 50% level. So, if you were looking for a long, I'm just putting out hypotheticals over here, but if you were looking for a long, I guess this would be it on Bitcoin. you'd be longing it um up for a 3.33 to potentially up to a 4.8 depending on which level it hits. So, let's go with the midpoint. Um the average between those is giving you about a 4:1 risk-to-reward ratio. This is a valid trade. You can take it, but I think you need a little bit of skill to execute this. Um and you know, I could take this trade, but I would need to sit and monitor this throughout, right? uh because I'd want to actively monitor this trade. If you started to come down and I saw signs that you were going to take that low out, I'd want to exit a bit earlier. But if you if you're happy to take the risk, well, it's about a 4:1 risk-to-reward ratio. Stops below there. Basically, you would be entering long over here and riding this up. It's just counter trend, right? So, you may ask, well, if you're such a genius, why don't you just take the trade? Well, the reason why is because it goes against my rule set, right? It's it's counter trend. the trend is still down and there's not enough for me to sway the probabilities in favor of taking this trade. It's not um you know I'm not as confident as I would be if the trends were up. If the trends were up I'd be like absolutely great. Let's hit it. But this is not a high confidence trade. But it's up to you. If you want to take it, go for it. Let's quickly check the moons. How long have we got before the next bare moon? So, if you do get this pump anyway, I believe that will lead into the next bare moon, which comes on the 18th of January, which is this Sunday, right? So, this would be the final week, and then the pendulum sw um um swings back into the favor of the bears where you're probably going to be looking for for lower prices again. Okay. Um yes, yes, yes. There we go. So, there here's some wise words from the the cryptocyclone. He says that um trade your system and not the chart. Exactly. You got to stick with your system. So, it's all about the probabilities, right? Um, you know, I could take, yes, I could take this as a small trade for, you know, just for some clout, but guys, I don't know. I'm not I'm I'm not really into that kind of stuff. As you've probably all noticed, I don't really go and like post P&Ls like, I told you I shorted here. I told you I longed over here. I don't really do that kind of stuff. Um, I just genuinely am trading my own book and and that's not a trade I'm going to take. Moving on. Could it form a bottom though over there? So, this is probably going to be building the case or helping those of you that are looking for the long trade. Well, in terms of probabilities, what we have seen is when you look at Bitcoin, um, you know, it's been 8 weeks since you've lost 100K after you get those kind of sharp sell-offs, it takes approximately, and this is in alignment with what I showed you on that weekly RSI as well, and how that begins to bottom. It's about 9 to 11 weeks um to to start to see the bounce. And therefore, according to this, well, this could be the moment 11 11 9 11 8 11."

It's about 9 to 11 weeks um to to start to see the bounce. And therefore, according to this, well, this could be the moment 11 11 9 11 8 11. So, you are in that vicinity where you could start to see a little bit of upside um pressure or a little bit of a short squeeze, whatever it is that you want to call it. But again, if it's counter to the trend, you've started to break down, lose a lot of key levels. Once you broke down, I'm just using my cursor below those lows. That was your previous high low. You broke it down, you created a lower low. That means this is a trend shift. So, anything that rallies up over here, you have to be on lower high watch. And that's an opportunity to get out of positions that you may have been stuck in. So, your momentum oscillators is climbing. It's moving up over here. You could continue to rally. This is all going to be massive resistance, right? This is basically your previous on the daily bearish order block. I'll just pull it across. So, yeah, you could rally all the way into that. you could um but the more you rally up it just becomes you know when you take the stairs up like this that becomes liquidity built up. You've heard the saying stairs up boom elevator down that would build the momentum for the bears. This would build the momentum for the bears because how does it work psychologically right? Um you know some people bought that bottom but they probably also bought this bottom and this bottom and this bottom and this bottom. So they're underwater. So basically maybe now they're getting to break even. Okay, some people bought that with an invalidation blow. Some people bought that, some people bought that, some people bought that. And psychologically, basically, most the people are probably at a loss from previous buys or at break even, which means that as soon as they see there's a chance that they're going to get into a deeper loss, that's what creates that acceleration down and that takes out all that liquidity. So, something to be aware of. And I will remind you, um, this is only going to make sense for the people that actually watched all my videos last week. Uh, I and I think I have it. See, this is what I'm talking about. I'm not really one to pull out the the timestamps, but I can pull it out. Can pull out the timestamps over here. Let's just quickly Let's pull out the timestamps over here. And we'll go to uh my section over here, and we'll have a look at uh let's see where is that here. Liquidity. There we go. So, what did I say over here? I said that this is um this is all liquidity underneath the yellow line on the little parabola. And I said specifically the dotted ones. There we go. Dotted ones over there. And it's pretty much right for the taking, right? I said that you could maybe get one more leg up, but I expect that all of those lines are going to be swept. Well, let's go through to that. They all got swept. There it is. Price came down, tagged it, tagged it, tagged it. Look at that perfect sweep there. You got that last one. There we go. You hit it 89,000. There we go. 89,284. You swept that level and you started to move towards the upside. So, um, therefore, what I'm suggesting is, well, you may see that that's an hourly time frame. You may see the same thing over here as this pushes up and develops more and more liquidity. There we go. Into this area, sweet spot just above 100K, built up liquidity, and then you smack it down. Okay, that's probably what's going to happen. That would be the base case. Uh, all righty. So, we can move into altcoins."

Okay, that's probably what's going to happen. That would be the base case. Uh, all righty. So, we can move into altcoins. We can have a look at a couple of other things. So, um if you do want to take any of the altcoin trades that we're going to have a look at today, guys, just remember they are currently running a promotion at the moment on uh Blofen, which basically gives you massive signup bonuses and volume incentives. You can get up to $9,400 over there. The most important thing for me at least about Blofen is there's no KYC whatsoever. Um so, you don't have to give in any of that personal information. uh and you're not really capped or limited to how much you can with withdraw. And then most importantly of all is um that they have uh fire blocks which means they're not custodying the funds. So that means that my funds are safe. That's that's what I like about Blofen. Let's move on. Let's have a look over here on the daily time frame and go into a couple of the other charts. So again guys, that is listed below. Everything is listed below. If you use those links, they have special incentives with YouTube videos below that show you how you can claim those sign up bonuses, right? So, keep an eye on that. Um, and then let's go. So, I I look through my full list. I'm just going to scroll very quickly. Look at this. Lot of stuff, right? I look through everything. Basically, basically 99% look like garbage. Um, but there were a few things that I could see the potential for a bit of a greater relief rally. And one is I guess ETH is is okay, right? It's got this falling wedge. It's still putting in the high lows. Um it's going to be similar to BTC in the sense that if BTC does reject from this, so if BTC makes its price move up into this zone and then puts in a big rejection, well, that's going to affect the full market and everything is going to go down off of that. But similar to what I just showed you as well on Bitcoin with the long trade setup, this one over here, if you were looking for a long trade setup, which is high risk, maybe you're someone that loves risk and you want to take that same long trade setup. Well, it would basically be an easy easy invalidation right now on ETH, just below those previous lows. You want your high low to form right here, right now. Um, and then you would start to target some of these previous highs, still giving you about a 4.7 to1 risk-to-reward ratio. You're only risking 3.2% 2% price move against you. Remember to go and calculate your risk. And you can do that on the whale trade side over here. If you go through to the bottom, just fill in the details. Here's your position size calculator. So, I'm not advocating that you lose 3.6% of all your money. You need to put you need to put the numbers in here, right? I'm not going to do the explanation now, but you need to put the numbers in here to calculate um you know what that trade setup would look like. That's one area. I wouldn't be surprised to see ETH grinded up a little bit higher over there. Other trades that look wonderful, of course, is uh Monero, which is the trade that we've been in for quite some time. We spoke about that as a huge cup and handle formation shown on the weekly time frame. There it is. Cup and handle formation. Here's your cup. Here's your handle starting to break out and we're looking at an acceleration to about uh 733. Could it go higher? Absolutely it can. But for now, we're in the trade. Just continue to hold it."

Here's your handle starting to break out and we're looking at an acceleration to about uh 733. Could it go higher? Absolutely it can. But for now, we're in the trade. Just continue to hold it. Um, if there is a pullback, of course, you're going to have a big inefficiency candle, a bit of a fair value gap, if you will, coming into this zone. So, you're probably going to pull back and accelerate. Um, and that will be another opportunity for you. So, okay, I will update you guys, of course, what to do with this trade, but for now, long and strong, just continue to hold it. Let's look at Zcash. Now, Zcash is an interesting one because it's privacy related as well. So if we have a look at this um you know there's Zcash's market cap is 6.8 8 billion. There's Monero's market cap. 10.7 billion. Why does this matter? Well, what matters about it is it's a privacy protocol that does its thing, right? It's, you know, what some say Bitcoin was meant to be. And these are together less than 1% of the value of Bitcoin. But I don't know are these things going to catch up and you know take market share two three four 5% of Bitcoin's market share and reach you know these higher targets that many have given these things. Honestly guys I don't know I wonder well why hasn't that happened before? Like why is it going to happen now when these things have already been around for 10 years? I don't know why all of a sudden I don't know it feels a bit like cabalish right that's that's a new word I've invented. Cabalesh is when you are part of the cabal and they're involved. That's the ish part, right? So they're involved. I don't know. I don't know. I have I'm not part of the cabal, unfortunately. Otherwise, I'm sure I'd be much wealthier. But anyways, when I have a look at this, to me, this one looks like a massive complacency bounce. And to invalidate that thought process, two things need to happen. So for Zcash, right, remember complacency bounce and all that you need to do for that is pull up the Wall Street cheat sheet. Should we do that quickly? Let me get on the other screen so I don't dox too much. Uh wall sheet cheat sheet. Let me quickly do this for you guys. While I'm doing that, smash the like button, guys. It would be very greatly appreciated. Um I would really really appreciate that to help to get the show content out. So, I'm quickly finding the Wall Street cheat sheet. And I want to show you guys something interesting. Uh, let's see if I can just copy this straight onto There we go. I can. Perfect. And we can just lower that a little bit. Maybe that's a bit too much. Wait, let's let's increase that a bit. There we go. All righty. So, what you need to consider is to me this looks very much like a complacency bounce, right? So, we can have a look at the chart. I'll make it easier for you to see in a moment. Let's just get the sizing correct over there. All right. I think it's a bit too dark. Wait, we're almost there. I'm going to lighten it in a moment. Uh, there we go. So, I'm going to lighten it in a moment just so you guys can see. But, Wall Street cheat sheet looks like that, right? leading to thrill euphoria."

But, Wall Street cheat sheet looks like that, right? leading to thrill euphoria. Do you remember in I said in November when nothing was pumping that I'm pretty certain by December you're going to put in the top the blowoff top would have occurred and I believe now this is the complacency bounce part of the the move right so if I just lower that a little bit now you can see it nicely um and there it is we can pretty much line that up so it doesn't need to line up exact it's more about the psychological points so there it is price moved up into where I said in November already I at that time I said I believe this is the major major top probably the alltime high and by December the top will be in and it was if you fast forward to December which is over here well the top was already in right price came down put in a little bit of a bounce I'm going to brighten the chart again so just pay attention there we go you see that and I believe there's a good chance that this is your complacency bounce okay so complacency bounce occurs over here which means as soon as you lose that white line at 303. This thing's going to get rinsed. Okay, I'm going to delete this because I don't want too much mess here and I need to um make a bit more of a point. Okay, I said two things need to happen to change my mind or invalidate that. The first thing is of course, well, if you just trade back above those highs, which is coming in at about 555. So, if you can see price move up, recapture 555, there should still be a throwback, right? That throwback like that, I'll trade it back to the high or say I'm wrong. You know what? We're going back for these highs. It's going way higher. Alternatively, the other thing that can happen is you need to spend more time ranging between these two. Okay, these two lines 303 and 530. If you can range a bit more between these, I'll be willing to try and pick some up at the bottom of the trading range and then trade it back here for TP1, TP2, and then TP3 will be a measured move breakout level that's going to take it like way over $1,000. So basically what I'm saying now is nothing is happening on this and any relief that occurs over here is actually a short opportunity with your stops above. Okay? And then you can short this all the way back down to the lows which is going to take it back to about um you know between 50 and and $50 and $70 I would say is likely. I'm even going to go as far as drawing the little yellow box in now of destiny. Okay, we're going to change it to yellow. We're going to call this the yellow box of destiny because that is in my opinion Zcash's destiny. So, we change it to yellow. And let's just quickly write over there. Destiny. There we go. All right. So, destiny is there. This [clears throat] is this is what I'm looking at if that complacency bounce plays out. And again, I gave the two criteria of what must happen for me to be incorrect and wrong because I don't have a crystal ball. We still looking for the supplier. If you find him, just send the details my way. We we've been looking for a year now for the crystal ball supplier. I don't have one. If you guys have one, please share it with me or at least the details of where I can buy it. Uh, moving on. Okay, let's have a look at a couple more things. Um, you know, XRP reject off here."

Um, you know, XRP reject off here. you know, probably going to get a bit of a technical bounce at some point over here coming into that golden pocket. A bit of a technical bounce, but otherwise, this still looks distributive to me. Salana looks okay, but it's in no man's land like it has been for so long. It has to come down pretty much to in the $100 zone. Uh, or it has to recapture and rebuild structure from higher. You're coming into key resistance over here. If you can flip this $2 for Suie into support, great. There's some opportunity, but otherwise, not much going on. Sonic is absolutely wrecked. say is wrecked. Cardano is wrecked. Avac is bearish and it's wrecked. Ton is wrecked. Casper is wrecked. This is probably a short opportunity pretty much over here. I mean, easy stop loss is above. Uh this is of course for for uh Tron, right? So for Tron, the closer you can get to that line over here, which is at about 3240 is a good opportunity for a short trade. Okay, pump. If it can recapture this 2670, we can we can talk again. Right now, nothing going on over there. Hype also no man's land. Uh had the bearish retest at 28 and I still think 19 and then 17 is going to be coming into play. A has been heavily hit. It's starting to look like the micro strategy chart consolidating around the lows. Will that consolidation lead to continuation? I don't have the answer yet. Um you know, here's lighter. You had the big move up. Here's your range. You've come down. I think you're going to easily come down into the bottom of this range now. One, two, three. This looks like it's going to accelerate. So, I wouldn't be buying into this. Just trade it, right? Trade it between the lows and the highs. The lows and the highs. Just let this thing uh base out for a while. Apex eventually hit our target. We'll go back onto the daily for that. So, there was our target. You guys remember last year when this was trading up here? I said it's coming here. very similar to the Zcash Destiny box, right? No one wanted to hear about the Apex Destiny box, but we went for Destiny and here we are. Okay, so bearish, right? Not much. Basically, what what I'm saying is when I went through this list, it's really limited to very few things. Uh, Bitcoin potential relief rally a little bit higher into that 100k zone. ETH potential relief rally a little bit higher into the 36 zone. Monero. Um, something weird's happening with the privacy coins. Let's just run with it. We'll we'll we'll jump onto the cabalish bandwagon. Zcash though, I'm thinking there's rotation from Zcash into Monero, and this one's going to distribute. Um, and that is the majority of what I'm looking at. Let's just quickly check out on our poll. What do we What do we got over here? We're still sitting at that 6040 split. So, a lot of you are still looking for that relief rally to continue. Um, yeah, time will tell. I think you need to keep your your book very tight. What do I mean by your book? Like your trading book, right? Your desk. Keep everything in order. Keep everything tight. Even more so than than last year. Don't get into, at least in my humble opinion, don't get caught up too much into building like long-term portfolios and things like that. Unless you have a very solid strategy and endless amounts of money to continue to dollar cost averaging uh to dollar cost average in, I would feel safer rather um having a portfolio of stocks, things like, you know, Tesla, Nvidia, um maybe a little bit of gold, uh NASDAQ."

Uh, other than, you know, the stock ones, uh, NASDAQ, that's a nice one. I think that's a good one. Good one to consider if you want a a lower risk trade opportunity over there. I will see you all on the next one, guys. Have a good day and cheers for now."
