      "text": "Now that everyone is talking about crypto, \nthe ones that you never thought would talk   about crypto, it's when you are giving up. Now that everyone is saying crypto is dead,   the major players, the ones that you always \nwanted, they are telling you what's coming. And most of you still think that crypto is dead \nand that we are going through a bear market and   all those doom and gloom things that you don't \nknow. It's not my position. And today I'm going   to show you that. Today I'm going to show you who \nis talking about crypto that never talked before,   the major shift we are seeing, and why maybe, \nmaybe holding is not that bad of a strategy. So,   welcome to today's session, today's therapy show, \na place where we share everything. Sometimes we   cry together when we open our portfolios. But \nthis is crypto, and if you want high returns, you   need to handle the volatility. And that's what I'm \ngoing to show you today. Because today I have real   examples of several assets that if you held, even \nif you sold at the top and still did the same DCA   every month, what would be the better strategy? So I want to know what you think. I want to know   your opinion. If you held an asset since 2022, \n2023, I don't care. You buy every month the same,   let's say $30 per month, you sell 50% off the \ntop, what will be the better strategy? Keep DCAing   after selling or just stop and leave the 50% back? Let me know in the chat because I'm going to show   you this today. I prepared this today because I \nthink it's time to end the doom and gloom. I'm a   data guy. Show me the numbers. I'll analyze them \nand I'll give you the data. And that's exactly   what I did today. So, but like I was saying, they \nare talking about crypto. They are talking about   stablecoins. They're talking about tokenization. And why are they talking about this? In Davos,   we were just at the World Economic Forum and \neveryone is talking about crypto. Crypto had a   major role there. Major role. And people think \ncrypto is dead. And again, today I'm going to   show you why being dead on the sentiment is \nexactly what you want. And this is what I'm   going to show you today. Okay. And obviously at \nthe end we are going to look at some charts. If   there are some trades I'm going to share with \nyou and yeah, let's start with this because I   want to show you this. From those that are here \nfor a long time seeing this, it's crazy honestly. This is really crazy and I'm not going to be the \nbearish doom and gloom, that's not my thing here. Just listen to this. Sorry, let me just take \nthat banner so that you can't see everything   as supposed to and then you'll be able to see it. I just need to remove that and sorry it's here. Okay. So, let's look at this. This \nhappened as I was telling you on Davos. This is the governor of the central bank of France \nand he's telling exactly what I'm telling you   today. Okay. If I'd been in Davos one year ago, \nnobody spoke about stablecoins and now they are   fashionable; tokenization and stablecoins. RWAs, \nit's the thing on Davos. Okay, you know why it's   not that hard to understand why? Because they \nknow. They know that with stablecoins and with   tokenization they can charge the same and spend \nless. They can charge the same for a transfer and   they spend less so there's more profit for them. Do you understand what I'm telling you? Also the   same for tokenization. The rails will be quickly, \nquickly. Okay. So let's keep watching this. Okay. Because it was really crazy again. Tokenization in \nDavos. Okay, this is Davos. You know that in 2022   people were saying Bitcoin was for laundering \nmoney there in Davos. And now they are talking   about stablecoins just here. Okay, we have more. I want to show you more. It's not just the central   bank of France. I want to show you this. UBS, \nthe CEO of UBS. Look at what he's telling you. \"I do believe that blockchain and that kind of \ntechnology is the future for the traditional   banking business. You will see a convergence of \nthat."

Okay, we have more. I want to show you more. It's not just the central bank of France. I want to show you this. UBS, the CEO of UBS. Look at what he's telling you. \"I do believe that blockchain and that kind of technology is the future for the traditional banking business. You will see a convergence of that. But you know we need to pay attention in   making sure that at the end of the day banks \nare, you know, live out of trust and people   want to put their assets and their, you know, \nwhatever assets they have in a trusted place and   I would say that new technology still needs to \nprove itself over the years and particularly   after quantum computing. Sergio I want to thank \nyou for coming.\" Do you know what happened after   this? UBS said they are going to open crypto \ntrading to their customers exactly after this   and this is what's happening right now. Okay. And \nI know that you are going to tell me that altcoins   are rekt and everything. We are going to analyze \nthat. Okay. I'm just showing you, like I said,   I'm a data guy. I'm not here to spread fear or \nto spread bullishness. I'm a data guy. And when I   show you the data you can tell me if you agree or \ndon't with me. But what I'm showing you right now,   it's exactly this. It's exactly that Davos is \ntalking about crypto and this was not happening   at this stage a year ago. Same here. Uh, sorry. Same here. Okay. Where CZ was there. You know,   CZ was in jail one year ago. Okay. We had CZ \nin jail a year ago. Now he's speaking in Davos. Now he's speaking at Davos. Is not... do you \nunderstand the shift here? Honestly, do you   understand the shift that we are seeing here in \nour industry? And I'm doing this because I want   people to say that altcoins are rekt. I know there \nare always a few here and I want them to come here   and say, \"Yeah but the altcoins are rekt, crypto \nis...\" I want them to come to the shed today. I   want you here. So like I was saying, he was here. I don't know if you agree with what he's going to   say. I'm going to show you and I want to know \nyour opinion. I'm not going to go on this. But   do you understand this? Do you understand that you \nhave central bank governors, we have Larry Fink,   CEOs of banks, everyone talking about crypto in \nDavos, the World Economic Forum? A guy that was   arrested a year ago now speaking at Davos. And \nnow let's go listen to what CZ said. Okay? And   this I want to know your opinion. And always \nplease tell me on the chat from where you are   watching. I always like to map the audience. \"If you look at a five, 10 year horizon,   it's very easy to predict. We're going to go up. If you look at a one year horizon, which is like   where most of the common framework is, 2026, I'm \nnot sure. You may be... I think I have very strong   feelings that you will probably be a Supercycle. Be a Supercycle. 2026. Yeah.\" Do you agree with   this? I'm not going to say we are going to have a \nSupercycle. Okay. I'm already two things that we   are not allowed to say right now on the YouTube, \nX, whatever: Altseason and Supercycle. But let   me know if you agree with this. I want to know on \nthe chat. \"For Bitcoin. And what Supercycle to you   means? What? Well normally Bitcoin follows four \nyear cycles historically. If you look at historic   data like every four years you know there's an \nall-time high and then there's a drop. But I   think this year given the US being so pro-crypto \nand every other country is kind of following,   I do think we will see this... we will probably \nbreak the four year cycle. Yeah.\" So the reason   why he's saying this is because we are waiting \nfor clarity. Two clarities."

Yeah.\" So the reason why he's saying this is because we are waiting for clarity. Two clarities. Clarity Act that will   bring clarity to the industry and there's been \na great discussion about this. We know Coinbase   decided to take the support out. I don't agree \nwith those sunglasses. At the beginning I think   it was Macron but then I saw it was CZ. But like I \nwas saying, Coinbase is still negotiating whatever   and I think it's coming but everything happens \nright now. Now there might be a delay because   of the snowstorm that is facing the US and if \nyou are in the US I hope everything is okay   with you and everything is going to be okay. But \nwe should have a Clarity Act markup next week. Okay. We should have that. But let's see. This was \nshared yesterday. They are doing everything for   the markup. They want to approve this. I think \nthere's a lot of interest in this to be honest   from both sides. I think my honest opinion and \ntake is that the delay, it was all orchestrated   for some reason. Okay, this is just my opinion. I \ndon't think there was any reason for that delay. I don't think there was any reason for that clash \nbetween Coinbase and the banks because the other   crypto companies didn't have the same opinion. It \nwas just Coinbase and it looks like Charles from   Cardano. But yeah, let's listen where we stand \ntoday with this. \"Well, Cheryl, it's great to be   with you. This is really an important priority not \nonly for President Trump, but for Republicans here   in the House where we've worked for four years \non market structure legislation and we've passed   it twice. We passed it in the last Congress, \nmy bill called FIT21 and then this Congress   just last July, we passed the Clarity Act, which \nis what the Senate is debating. And the Clarity   Act got 78 Democratic votes here in the House. We \nlay out the strict rules for market structure on   how to use a treat a digital asset as a commodity \nor as a security, how you store it, how you can   custody it, how it can be used for collateral, how \nbanks...\" We should have clarity this week. Okay,   we should have the clarity this week or at least \nthe markup. But the thing is, like I was saying,   there's a big snow coming to the US. I think \nit's really serious from what I saw. So,   we might have a delay. Okay, we probably are \ngoing to have a delay again on this. Should   be... I understand the delay now. Okay, if there's \na storm, no one is going there to vote. So, yeah,   that makes all sense. But then there's something \nthat I want to show you because I really want   to go on this, okay? Because, you know, I'm not \na... how can I say... a doom and gloom, you know,   I'm not that type of person. I'm never going to \nshow you fear. When I think I need to be bearish,   I'll be bearish. But CZ, and I know you don't \nlike CZ, I'm okay with that. But he tweeted this,   okay? And I did an exercise. That's why I want \nto know your opinion. And this is why I asked   at the beginning of the stream. If you bought \n$30 of crypto since 2022, beginning of 2022,   and you kept it doing this strategy, buying \nevery month till 31 of December of 2025,   would you be in profit or would you be at a loss? Also, if you sold 50% of an asset at the top,   would you be better to stop DCA or keep DCAing? Because this is a really important exercise. Okay,   CZ tweeted this: \"Buy now old now retired in \na few years.\" I don't know if this is true,   not financial advice. I'm just telling you that \nthis made me do an exercise. Okay."

If you bought $30 of crypto since 2022, beginning of 2022, and you kept it doing this strategy, buying every month till 31 of December of 2025, would you be in profit or would you be at a loss? Also, if you sold 50% of an asset at the top, would you be better to stop DCA or keep DCAing? Because this is a really important exercise. Okay, CZ tweeted this: \"Buy now old now retired in a few years.\" I don't know if this is true, not financial advice. I'm just telling you that this made me do an exercise. Okay. And I tried to   be... so you are saying you are at a loss. Okay. I \nhave someone saying here that they are at a loss. I would like more opinions. Let me know because \nI'm going to show you this. I tried to be more... I didn't want to add memecoins of course but I did \nan exercise and I think you are going to find this   really, really funny. Okay. And this is what \nI did and I'll show you this. So if you bought   $30... I'm going to give you the timeframe. $30 \nevery month of 10 assets. I'm going to show you   now which are the assets. Since 1st of January of \n2022, before the major crash (it was in November)   and you stop DCA on 31 of December of 2025, three \nyears. And I have two exercises: one you sell 50%   at the top of every asset between this timeframe, \nthe other one you sell at the top but you keep   doing DCA. And this is facts. This is numbers \nand I can share this with you later. Okay? And if   you sold 50% and continue to DCA, your portfolio \nright now today... this is today, I did this right   before the show... will be with more profit and \nmore returns than if you sold that 50% and stopped   DCAing. This is facts. Okay. And now I'm going to \nshow you. This is the breakdown that I have. Like   I said, I try to have everything. I have Bitcoin, \nEthereum, BNB, HBAR, AVAX, DOGE, SOL, LINK, XRP. I have all of them here. Okay? And if... let me \nknow if you can see the numbers. Well, I hope so,   but I'm going to show you this. You can be able to \nsee this later. Like I was saying, if you bought   $30 per month, that would be around $1,440 per \nasset in three years. Okay? In all these assets,   you'll still be in profit no matter what you did. If you sold 50% at the top and keep buying $30,   if you sold 50% at the top and you stop buying \n$30... this is numbers. You wouldn't be at a   loss. So, why am I doing this exercise? First, I \nsaw the tweet from CZ and I want to see if it was   true or not. Okay? If you could hold and do this. Second, I know a lot of people are telling you   that holding altcoins is rubbish. Sorry, it's... \nyou shouldn't do it. That holding Bitcoin is   where you'll make more money, etc. Facts, numbers. That's not the right thing. That's not true. And   I'm telling you, if you DCA every month on periods \nwhere no one is looking at crypto, because that's   what we did in this exercise... crypto was dead \nin 2022. The market, it was still the laundering   money thing. It was still the criminal thing in \n2022. No one cared about the market. No one. And   if you did this, you'd be in profit. If you sold \n50% at the top and you invested $30 per 10 assets,   that's around $300 per month. Look, you'd be \nwith cash. If you sold 50% and kept DCAing,   you'll be 20k in cash, 33% total portfolio, and \nyour crypto portfolio will be valued at $13k,   $13,000, almost 14. If you stop this but still \nsold at the top the same amount like I told you,   you'll be 20k in cash, 11 on your portfolio, \ncrypto portfolio, and total $31,000. So I can   zoom in if it's easier for you. Let me try to... I think it's here. Let me try to zoom in so maybe   you can see better. Is it better now? Okay. Yeah, \nnow you can see better, right? I just zoomed in. So, do you understand what I'm showing you here? This is what data tells us. Okay?"

So, do you understand what I'm showing you here? This is what data tells us. Okay? And when I show   you this... why? It's not financial advice. Okay? But the time that I made most money is   when nobody cared about it. I wrote an article \non X about silver. If you go to my X, you have   the link in the description. I wrote that. Do you \nunderstand how crazy people called me for buying   silver at $15, $20, $30? Look where silver is \nnow? It's here. $100. Do you think buying silver   here... and you can do like this... do you think \nbuying silver here it was a smart thing to do? Do you think that? No. Of course not. You're \nstupid for buying silver here and even here. Now you are smart because now it's clear what \nhappened. Okay, now it's clear there was a supply   shock, that there was demand. There was everything \nbecause now it's obvious. The thing is like this. Where do you want to be? Do you want to be on the \nobvious crowd or do you want to be on this crowd? I'm just telling you, where do you want to be? Usually when things are dead, you are okay. And   you know why accumulation periods are good? Do you \nknow why? Because you can increase your bags. So   you can have more, you can have a bigger moon bag \nif you want to. This is what this exercise shows   you. This is what this exercise shows you. If you \nkept buying while no one cared, I would say till   November 2024 that was an accumulation period, \nyou'd be buying, you would be... you need to   sell less to achieve your targets. You can leave \na bigger moon bag or take the decision if you want   to. Someone is asking here how do you know it was \nat the top? It's easy to know that, at least for   me that I'm here since 2022. I had my targets. I showed you here already. HBAR. I saw that the   10x... a part of my bag and this is easy to do the \nexercise. But even if you go lower, you can lower   the targets. You can do this and lower the targets \nif you want to. Okay. When I said at the top, it   was an easy way to build this. I could have said \nnot at the top. I could have sold on the way up. It will be exactly the same exercise. Okay. So, \nbut like I was saying, I had my targets, I define   my targets, and that's when I sell. So, this is \nthe same logic that I'm applying here because this   is my strategy and has always been my strategy \nbecause I have my targets and I respect my targets   and with my targets all these assets have been \nsold 50% at the top. Not exact top. This is for an   exercise-wise of course, but you understand what \nI'm showing you here. You understand this, right? It's not that hard to understand. So, like \nI was saying, it's not cool to buy here,   but you are a genius because you bought here \nwhen prices are here. Okay? I'm not telling   you to buy or sell anything. I'm just telling \nwhat I do. And if it works for me, in theory,   it should work for you. Right? This is why you \ncan see here why I don't think that we are in   the bear market. Why not panicking? Because I'm \nfacing all this doom and gloom and I'm still in   profit. Both on my holdings and both on my cash \nposition when I sold and I took profits. Numbers   don't lie. Okay? And this is why I like numbers. This is why I don't like doom and gloom. Okay? Let   me know if this is clear to every one of you."

And this is why I like numbers. This is why I don't like doom and gloom. Okay? Let me know if this is clear to every one of you. I just want to know if everyone is clear...   if this is clear to every one of you because \nhonestly I'm really tired of seeing everyone   telling you that owning altcoins is not \ngood, that whatever you want to call it,   okay? And that you should sell everything, \nwhatever. Yeah, maybe you should. But if you sold   partially... look at this. This is an investor \nportfolio. This is an investor portfolio. Buy,   you sell profit, you sell some, you keep some, you \nhave cash. And I'm talking about $30 per asset. Or 1.5, almost 1.5k per month on total. Okay, \nit's not that hard to understand. So two goals   I have here. I don't know if this is right or not. I'm not telling that you will retire because of   crypto. I think he's right about AI, but that's \nanother thing. But you have a clear example here   and I'm going to leave you this here on the chat \nand then we're going to add to the description. Let me just show you here. So you can clearly \nsee here, okay, a clear exercise telling you   everything you need to know. Okay. So the next \ntime someone is telling you holding doesn't work,   keeping your bags doesn't work, altcoins \nget rekt, just show you this and tell them,   okay, tell me why. Where is your why you're doing \nthis? If you're talking about trading portfolio,   that's different. I have my trading portfolio, but \nI have my hold portfolio. We are investors here,   right? We are traders and we are investors. We \nare both. We trade and we invest. And this is   data facts and that's always what you're going \nto have for me, facts and data. And let me know   if you have any questions. I just share this \nwith you and if you have questions about this,   whatever, just ping me on X and then I'll be more \nthan happy to upload this. I just wanted to give   this exercise because I think it's important to \nunderstand that not everything is doom and gloom   and not... there's no bearishness here. Okay, \nyou can hold altcoins, you can hold Bitcoin,   you can whatever you want. Just one thing. Okay, \nI'm a multicycle holder as you already know and   these coins survive multicycles. Okay, do you \nknow which one didn't work? Do you know which   one didn't work? BNB. BNB didn't work because it \nkept going higher. Okay, you have that example   here. So I tried to cover everything just for you \nto understand the exercise of this year, beginning   of 2022. So 2022 we had two major crashes. The \nfirst one was because of Russia and Ukraine. The   second was FTX. So the prices went really down. We start buying on this exercise before the crash. Before the crash. Okay? And then we start to sell. We sell 50% at the top. Let's say like this. The   next week I can bring you this if you start \nselling in percentages. And there you go. This   is the numbers. $30 per month. Okay. If you want \nto know exact numbers, just go here and you check   it. Okay. Maybe I'll try to make this for your \nasset, but that's something that will take more   time. And I want this to be to today's prices, \nokay? To today's price. So let me know if this   was clear. Let me know if you understand this. And \nlet me know if this made you feel better knowing   that holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins, it's \na strategy. DCA, it's a strategy. It's not stupid   like someone tried to sell you. And that's what \nthe... you can look at those people, the crew that   \"the top is in\" or \"the top is out\" or whatever, \nor \"the bottom is in or not\", is always moving."

I'm a guy that likes to be happy. I like   to be happy. So, let's go. Regarding Bitcoin. Um, \nright now I'm not on any trade on Bitcoin. I won't   be on any trade on Bitcoin till I have more \nclarity. Not the Clarity Act because we don't   know what's coming. But I want to understand what \nBitcoin wants to do. Okay. Because right now for   me it's not clear. Okay. It's not clear. Rejected \nhere 97,400, a big rejection, then it dropped all   the way down and I want to understand what's \ncoming here. Just for you, just one thing. On   the higher timeframe we are still Gucci. There's \nno problem. Okay? We still have a higher low and   we haven't invalidated anything. Okay? All these \nmoves here are just for people to make doom and   gloom videos or whatever. It's up to you to... \nit's price action but it's a short timeframe. Okay, it's a shorter timeframe. It's awesome for \nscalping. But more than that, yeah, it's just   noise in my opinion. Okay, so we bounced from here \n$87k and yeah, and then we are consolidating here,   which I don't think is that positive. Okay, \nI would prefer to see a bigger candle,   a bigger one, like an impulsive candle. We are \nnot seeing that right now. And so yeah, but I do   believe that the most probable move, but I'm not \ntrading, okay, move might be trying the 92,500,   93 again and then we need to see if it's going \nto fail. If it's going to fail, probably going to   come lower and this will be my targets here. Okay. So, what I'm expecting right now, and I think this   might be the move that, like I said, it's hard to \nread right now for me. I don't have any problem   saying it. But I think that the probable move will \nbe something like this. And if we reject here,   then we might come lower. Okay? Then we might \ncome lower. If we can close above this here,   then you invalidate this scenario here. Okay? You invalidate this scenario here. That's what   I believe. Okay. And yeah, this is what I think is \ngoing to happen. I might be wrong. The other thing   is like if we close below I would say 87, around \nhere, then this scenario is invalidated and we're   probably going straight here. Okay, this is what \nI'm seeing for Bitcoin right now. And that's why   and this is what I'm paying attention. That's why \nI'm not trying to trade Bitcoin right now. Because   I want to see everything. Also, be careful with \nwhat's going to happen in the Middle East this   weekend. Okay, it's another reason why I don't \nhave... I'm not trading actively is that there   might be some problems in the Middle East. Okay. But this is what I'm looking for. And so I'm going   to stay with this. This is the scenario I was \nlooking for. Yeah. Guys, if you are going to the   chat, talk about memecoins here. This is the worst \nchat for that. This is the worst chat for that. Okay. Talking about memecoins here. Yeah. Not \nwith me. So, just to let you know, don't... I'm   not going to talk any memecoins here. Okay. Only \nAVAX."

So, just to let you know, don't... I'm not going to talk any memecoins here. Okay. Only AVAX. I might talk about now moving forward. And   before moving forward I want you to remember this. Okay, you have a link in the description. You have   a massive bonus from BitUnix and I have something \nfor you. Okay, in the next weeks there will be   some announcements, some news from my side. If \nyou're not registered on BitUnix and you don't   have a UID from BitUnix you won't be able to join \nwhat I'm going to do. Okay, I'm just telling you. Okay, the only thing that I ask is that you join \nBitUnix. You trade on BitUnix, is in the link   below and then there's something coming in the \nnext days. I would say today's worst week. There's   something coming. Okay, but that's up to you. You \nhave the link in the description and yeah, I'm not   going to tell you more because I don't want to \ntell you more. But there's something coming. And   you need to be on BitUnix. Easy, easy as that. And \nif you want to trade in an environment like this,   you have the bonus. The risk the bonus, not your \nprofit. So again, moving to Ethereum. Ethereum   kind of looks like Bitcoin. I don't like this \nthing here. Okay. I don't like these candles here. It's for me it's okay. I'm not going to trade \nthis. It's in the middle of nowhere and yeah,   I don't want to touch it. So, like I was saying \non Ethereum, I think that we might try to recover   $3,000. We might try to do that. But yeah, \nit's lacking some strength here. I would like   to see some strength here. It rejected the $3,400 \nunfortunately. And now we are seeing some weakness   here. And so, I would be careful here. Okay. I \nwould really be careful here. And if we recover   $3,000 as support, I'll flip bullish. Okay. But \nnow we are in the middle of nowhere. We can come   down to 2,890 and then go to 3,000. And yeah, this \nis no man's land for me. No man's land for me. And   I'm not going to touch it. Okay. Like I said, and \nalso the Middle East situation regarding XRP. XRP   I'm buying XRP spot. Okay, but this is me. You \ndon't have to do it. So, I would say that we   have a good chance that we have a bottom here. We \nalready tapped this one, two, three times and but   it's showing some weakness. Like the entire market \nright now is showing some weakness. So, I would   say that we might be ranging here on this between \n$2.00, $1.30, $1.83. We might be ranging here   for a while. I've said this and I'll keep saying \nthis. Below $2.00, we need to be careful because   we might go for $1.60. And I have that here. And I have that target here. And if I get it,   I'll be a very happy person. But yeah, right now, \nif we don't recover the $2 quickly, I think we   need to look at this. Okay. But the thing is like \nwe had so many taps on $1.80 that's being defended   that it's really hard to understand. Okay, it's \nreally hard to understand this. So if you lose...   the invalidation for a move up for XRP \nin my opinion is losing $1.80. Okay,   losing $1.80. I would say maybe this wick here, \nlet me just remove this. This was from previous   streams. Maybe this wick here is going to get \ntouched. We're going to have a flush and touch   that wick and that might be a good entry \nif you want to long it if we get it. Okay,   it's not doing something like this. We can leave \nthis here. Yeah, one stop per weekend is not that   bad. So, we can leave this here. Let's see if \nwe are going to fill this wick."

Yeah, one stop per weekend is not that bad. So, we can leave this here. Let's see if we are going to fill this wick. I want a tight   stop loss. Something like this. And then we're \ngoing to try a move higher. Okay. To around here. This is what I would do. Okay. I will do this. If \nit goes here, you can see I have the alert here. If it comes here, I'm going to take this trade. Okay. Just being simple and clear with you. I'm   going to take this trade if it comes here. Okay, \nI'm not going to long it now. It might go higher,   but yeah, Middle East is escalating, so I'm \nnot going to take that. And you need to know   when to trade and when not to trade. If you \nwant to scalp in and I do that every day,   okay? Maybe not on weekends, but what I do \nusually is that I take one or two hours, I scalp,   that's my trading day, and I'm okay with that. If \nthere's no major things happening, then I might   trade for longer. But right now, I think I want to \nbe careful here. Okay. Also, I want to talk about   LayerZero. So, I want this trade from LayerZero. I'm telling you that I'm trying to get the bottom   of LayerZero and I want I really want to take the \nbottom of LayerZero. Yeah, it's been a mess. Total   mess. But I covered my LayerZero airdrop. Okay. So any stop loss I have is more than covered   but I want to catch the bottom of LayerZero. So \npay attention to LayerZero. Okay, we might have   our low here. We might have done our low here. We recover this resistance. We came lower this   night but now we are again above $1.75. And if \nwe can hold the $1.75 I think we are okay for   continuation. Okay. But the true confirmation it's \nhere. Okay. And just let you know this is not my   final TP. Probably I'm going if this confirms I'm \ngoing to keep the trade open and but like I was   saying here it's where you're going to invalidate \nthat we are not coming lower anymore. Okay. So we   need to understand if you're now putting a higher \nhigh and you are going to put a sorry a higher low   and they are going for a higher high and then we \nhave our reversal or not. So this is a risky trade   but I think it's a trade that is going to pay off \nwhen you catch it. It's like trying to catch the   Bitcoin bottom when you are at the bear. It's \nexactly the same. You know you're going to get   stopped one, two, or three times, but when you \nget it, it's more than enough to pay all the   stop loss that you might have. So, we have people \nfrom Zurich here. Awesome. In Dubai. Okay. So,   let me know on the chat if you want me to see \nsomething, any charts and no memes. The only   meme that I talk about is AVAX. Okay, it's AVAX. It's the only one and it's going. It's a real   meme. It's a big meme. Okay, this is a big meme. It's trying... I know what... I hold AVAX. Okay,   and I think AVAX is a great chain, but I don't \nknow what's happening with AVAX right now. Okay,   but I have it and I hold it. And if you go here, \nif you go here, I think AVAX is one of the worst. No, it's not the worst. Yeah, it's not the worst one. Ethereum is the... No, exactly. If you \nstop DCA, AVAX was the worst one. Okay,   I'm almost sure. Yeah, even with DCA, AVAX is \nstill the worst one. So, yeah, I don't know why,   but I really like AVAX. I really like it. So yeah, you are asking for AERO. Sure."

Let me know what you think about that. All the support. I don't \nknow when I drew this here. I don't know but probably it was last week \nand you only hear people ask me for AERO but   it all... I don't know when I drew this. It \nwas not this week on the Portuguese stream   so probably it was here on last Saturday. It came to support and it reacted so yeah   it's not bad. I will not go... how I would not \ntrade now like I told you, Middle East situation   etc. But it reacted where it should react. Let \nme check one thing. Yeah, it's a mess here. Yeah, be careful here. Okay, we need to move \nhigher. We need to move above at least 51,   52 cents. Let's say like this. We need to \nmove this... we need to move higher than this. If to be sure. So let me see more comments. Kaspa. We talked this about I remember this one. I \ndidn't take this trade but I think it was from   my Portuguese stream this week. Someone asked me \nabout it and I said, \"This is just a feeling that   this might work.\" And it's working. So, yeah. See, \nnow I'm going to have a good Saturday. And this   was on Wednesday. Yeah, I remember this. This is \non the Portuguese stream. By the way, if you speak   Portuguese, I go live every day on Crypto Portugal \nor Portuguese. Every day you have the link in the   description. Follow us there because there you \ncan watch me, see me every day. There's a therapy   session every day. Like I said, sometimes you \nlaugh, sometimes we cry, but at least we do   everything together. And we do it in Portuguese. So, join me there if you haven't followed us yet. Yeah. But what can I tell you? This was a trade \nthat I was going to take that I didn't take, but I   would... I had the feeling it would be a good one. This was paper trading. Now it's at support. So,   yeah, I think we can go for continuation if \nthere's no drama. If there is no drama in the   Middle East, if Bitcoin doesn't decide to test \n85, 84. I think we can go for continuation here. No problem about that. No worries about this \nto be honest. I think it's not a bad chart. Quant. Quant for me is in accumulation period. I've \ntold you this. In my opinion, Quant is under   accumulation period. Right now, it's at support. If you want to try something here, yeah, I know   if I get stopped, I'll get everyone on the next \nstream and I need to deal with that. But yeah,   if you want to long this here, it's a risky one. Okay, this is a risky long. But if you want to... Let me see what do I have here. Yeah, this is \nreally risky. But if you want to do something   like this, you need to be at least... I \nthink the risk/reward is not here. Maybe   you can try this. Yeah, I'll do this. If \nI was trading, I would take this trade. Yeah, I don't think there's any... Yeah, I'll \ntake this trade. Maybe I'll be a bit lower   and I'll take this. So, for... Yeah, I will \ntake this trade. I had no problem with this. Yeah, this is a trade I will take. I'm not \ntouching my phone, so I'm not taking the   trade. Okay, like I said, I don't... Today \nI'm busy because I'm building something   for you guys."

I don't know when I drew this. I think \nit was on my stream also. Um yeah,   if you believe AVAX is going to recover \nand now it's testing the resistance as   support and the support failed. Check on the low timeframe. Yeah, if it was here I would have taken the \ntrade. Now I think it might be risky. Yeah,   you need to subscribe and like the shows. Okay, \nand please let me know where we are going,   where you are watching. So where you are watching, \nplease. And let me know if you like the idea. Every Saturday after I do the live stream, I \nend the stream, then I start a private Zoom   and we all do live trading together. Let me know \nabout that. We might do it. I don't know. It's   raining in Portugal. It's cold. I don't want to \ngo outside. And maybe we can do that. So more... I'm spot only. My $100 intent, \nwhere on Quant? I'm not... Okay. I know. Let me know if I find the \nchart. I think it was this one. Let me see. No. Yeah. So, I talked about Quant before on the \nchannel. I think it was here. And I said this,   okay? And it's up to you. I'm not just telling \nyou because you're telling me that you want to   get out. I have Quant. Quant is the reason... \nhow can I say this? Quant is the reason. Quant   was the token that really changed my life. Okay. I bought Quant really early and then it had a   major pump. And this is not the best chart. The \nbest chart is the KuCoin one. And I've gave this   example a lot of times and I'm going to give it \nagain. So I bought Quant here, like a lot. I was   really lucky. I even bought it lower than $30. It \nwas around $20 or something like this. And then I   sold it on the way up and this was a crazy move. Okay. And this is one of the tokens that really   helped me to change my life and to embrace \ncrypto. And now I'm here talking with you on   the Banter channel. Okay. My background, look \nfor you to understand. I started at the bank,   then I was at a financial institution and in 2021 \nI quit. Okay, I quit. I said look I don't want to   work for anyone now. I don't need to. Luckily I \ninvested in crypto. I believe this is why I'm such   a believer in holding. Okay, because it worked \nfor me. It changed my life. And when I'm here   telling you showing data, facts, and numbers, it's \njust not the random thing. It changed my life. I   stopped working for other people because I bought \nwhen no one cared. I sold and I had enough money   so I didn't have to work for anyone else. Okay, \nthis is why I'm like this and I know it works. If   it works for me, it should work for you. And I'm \nthe most transparent person with all of you. So   just for you to be aware of this. This was Quant. And regarding this, I want to tell you something. I really like Quant and I think Quant might \nperform really well. I don't know your situation,   okay? I don't know why you want to sell \nit. I don't know if it's the pressure,   you have a lot of money invested, whatever. But I gave this example here, okay?"

If you   want to take a risk, if you want to risk 30% for \na chance of 400% or maybe let's say 10x, for me,   Quant is one of the tokens that might deliver \nyou that. Okay? But this is just my opinion. And   I tell you why. Because there's only 14 million \ntokens of Quant. No more. Okay? No more of that. Quant is delivering. Quant Network is being used. Quant is going to be needed for the Quant mainnet. Okay. So this is not an endorsement. I'm fully \ninvested in Quant. I have Quant. Okay. But I   want you to understand what Quant is. Okay. I might be wrong. It might go to zero. Okay. But when you see what they are doing and when \nyou have the CEO of the Quant company saying,   \"I don't care about your complaints about the \nprices. I'm here to deliver a product and when the   product is delivered everything else will come to \nplace.\" This is what I want to listen from a CEO. Okay. I've said this several times. So it's up to \nyou if you want to exit at break even. I think if   it's going to let you sleep well at night, do \nit. Okay. I'm just giving you my perspective   and it's not... I usually don't do this, okay? Usually when people tell me sell everything,   I want to sell at break even, I say go for it. I \nthink it's wise, whatever. But on Quant I think   you should study the project, do the research, see \nwhat they are doing, and then take that decision. And this is just my two cents about Quant. So \nlet me see. It's raining in Marbella. Yeah,   I love Marbella. I really like Marbella. Wait, \nlet me see more tokens that you were asking. AVAX   wasn't this... was on a tear recently, right? Let \nme see. Yeah, this will retrace for sure. Well,   someone yesterday was saying on my community, \nthe Portuguese one. \"Yeah, there goes the Alfie   price action with corrections, right?\" Because of \nsilver. There's no correction in silver because   we are always saying that the alpha price action \nneeds to have pumps and corrections, right? Go and   sell. And someone wrote, \"Yeah but that's not the \ncase for silver.\" I would be careful here. I don't   like this. Let's see here. Yeah, this might \nretrace. Probably it will retrace. Okay. Um, yeah, this is a very hard one to read because now it's at support and if \nyeah, but I don't think it's going   for continuation. Might be wrong here. Um, \nbut yeah, if I wanted to take a trade here,   I'll be looking only in this \narea. I'll be looking for a trade. The... and this is a risky one. It's paper trading. I'm not going   to take it but I want to check it on the \nnext Saturday. I would be taking this. Yeah, I would take this in the RR \nis horrible. Maybe a bit lower. Yeah, I'm not going to take this trade. I just \nwant to see what's going to happen because when   we have a pump like this, it needs to retrace. Okay. It should retrace. This is not silver. This   is AVAX. So yeah, probably it will get stopped \nagain. I'm not trading this, just paper trading   just to see if I was correct and we can come \nhere on next Saturday to see if I'm correct   and I break a bar. If I'm wrong, you troll me. So \nit's a win-win situation for both. And so let's   see. But I'm going to leave this here and see \nwhat's going to happen. And I want to just do   here. So if I start to get stopped, I will know to \nbring this on the next show. Kronos, Crypto.com. It had a pump this week, right? Or tried to \npump."

So if I start to get stopped, I will know to bring this on the next show. Kronos, Crypto.com. It had a pump this week, right? Or tried to pump. I'm a big believer in CRO. So again,   it's the thing with CRO. Yeah. See, I remember \nwhen I posted this before this major pump. Look,   we could have on the exercise we did here... I \ndidn't put CRO and I could have done it. Okay,   but this was a big outlier. This was because of \nthe partnership with the Trump company and yeah,   but this is a perfect situation. You had all this \ntime. Okay, this... Thank you for asking because   this just validates the points of my stream today. You had all this time. It was there. No one cared   about it. Whatever. And maybe can go lower. Okay, \nwe can go to a bigger timeframe and you had more   time. Okay, but yeah, look, usually this happens. Consolidates, pump, consolidates, pump. Now it's   going to consolidate probably going to get another \npump. Okay, but look, you had all this time, okay,   to buy around, I don't know, 10 cents, 7 cents, \nwhatever. And then it went to 38 cents out of   nowhere. Do you understand what I'm telling you \nthis? Thank you for asking this. So, regarding   CRO, right now it's at support, but CRO you need \nto understand one thing that's really important. It's a cashback token. Okay, cashback token. So, \nwhat does this mean? When something is pumping,   people sell the cashback token to buy that token. So, CRO dumps if the market is dumping and people   are seeing the cashback dollar or euro value going \nlower, they sell the cashback. They keep... they   stack fiat. Don't ask me why, but they do it. And \nso, yeah, I'm bullish. I think Crypto.com will be   Revolut on steroids. If you go to my X, I joke \nabout that a lot. I think that's what's going to   happen with Crypto.com. I'm invested on Kronos. I \nhave a lot of tokens from when I used to use the   card and went before they slashed the cashback. So, yeah, I do believe it's going to perform well,   but I know it's a cashback token. So I know \nthere's volatility here. So just don't go all in   on cashback tokens. Okay. But yeah, it's holding \nsupport right now. And if you can hold this, the thing here is like if we are going to 85 \nmaybe this wick was going to get filled. Okay,   there was something that happened this week that \nmaybe... there's no maxi today. Usually they   always come here. But usually sorry what happened \nthis week is that we had Bitcoin dropping 10%...   sorry and altcoins dropping 15%. And usually \nwhen Bitcoin drops 10% altcoins drop 20, 25,   30% and there was some strength on the market \non the altcoin market. Okay, I know everyone is   going... I know a lot of people is not going to \nagree whatever. Data, facts, that's what I have. So yeah, let's see if we go to 84, 85 and there's \nsome flush on the market or maybe some wicks to   clean some longs. We might come here. Worst case \nscenario, we are going to fill the wick. Maybe   just like a, you know, that damaged wick when \nthere's a flush, you just see going down then   it recovers immediately. That probably is going to \nhappen. That's something that might happen more. Is there more or I'm going to close the show? Can you see? No one asks for CRO Convex today. People use silver. Tell me when do you use \nsilver? You... I know in the industry use   silver. But let me know when do you use it? The \nindustry is using silver. The same way that I   told you that the industry is going to start to \nuse crypto. It's not that hard to understand. Okay. So guys, going to wrap up here. Thank you for \nbeing here."

So guys, going to wrap up here. Thank you for being here. Like I said, this was a show to   tell you that hold is not a bad strategy. DCA \nis not a bad strategy and everyone is talking   about crypto right now. Thank you for being here. Follow me on X because now I'm going to start to   be more active. I'm just building something \nand then I think all of you will enjoy if   you join me of course and see you all next week. Remember, be careful this weekend with the Middle   East situation and subscribe to the channel, \nleave the like, and pay attention to my X."
