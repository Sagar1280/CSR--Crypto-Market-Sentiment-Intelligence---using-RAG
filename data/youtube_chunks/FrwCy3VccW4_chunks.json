      "text": "So, we want a piece of ice for world protection \nand they won't give it. We've never asked for   anything else and we could have kept that piece \nof land and we didn't. So, they have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, \nor you can say no and we will remember. I don't   know. That sounds like a laced threat to me. The good news is that everyone's at Davos. The   mood is good. Trump got his piece of ice or he \ngot a section of his piece of ice. And the big   thing is that the markets are now responding. In \nfact, this is what's happening on the markets. But is this response worth anything? And does \nit change the whole picture? I don't think so. But let's talk about it today because there's \na lot of data points that we actually need to   look at. Everyone's at Davos. Everyone's rubbing \nshoulders with everyone else. The mood is good. The feeling is good. The markets are green. But \nthe big question is, does this change the big   picture? That's what we're going to be talking \nabout today. Big, big, big show. Let's go, guys. You know, every year I say, \"Next year I'm going \nto go to Davos. Next year I'm going to go to   Davos.\" And I never land up going to Davos because \nit's in the middle of our summer. And, you know,   the one thing I love is being here in summer. And \nto go there where it's so cold to rub shoulders   with people and to have meetings with people. I \nguess next year remind me before Davos that I said   I'm going to actually go to Davos. Guys, a lot is \ncoming out of Davos. Stuff about the Clarity Act,   stuff about Greenland, stuff about the tariffs. Everything here impacting markets. Markets are   recovering, but this is playing exactly, \nexactly, exactly like we said it would,   right? Exactly as per the tariff playbook. We are \nnow getting that relief rally and the question is   does that relief rally actually change anything? And that's what we're going to be talking about   today, so it's going to be a big show. What I \nneed you to do as usual, smash the like button   and please help me get distribution. I'll be \nhere every single day bringing you crypto love,   crypto wisdom, and these amazing updates. All I \nneed is for you guys to smash the like button. Anyway, so let's talk about what is happening at \nDavos. So, everyone's at Davos, the mood is good,   and as you can see today, all the European \nmarkets are up. And that is because Trump got   his Greenland or he got a piece of Greenland. He dropped the tariffs against the European   Union. The mood's good. Everyone's rubbing \nshoulders. They're all making announcements   and they're saying how amazing things are going \nto be and the markets are responding. We've got   beautiful green candles. We got Fantom up 14%, \nback up at almost 15. You've got all these other   ones actually going up. You've got Bitcoin and \nBitcoin has recovered. I mean, if you look at   where we were from the bottom, we were at $87,185 \nand now we're at $89,000 or just under $90,000,   $89,900. And the truth is though that even though \nthe markets went up and even though the S&P went   up, and you can see that the S&P futures \nare now up another half a percent over here,   this pump changes absolutely nothing. We're not \nback into this ascending triangle or you can't get   back into the ascending triangle. We're still in \nthis bear flag formation. I still can't be bullish   until we break up above this $98,000 level. And this is the part that's the most worrying,   right? We could get a relief bounce and maybe \nit'll take us to 90. Maybe it'll take us to   92. Maybe it'll even take us up to 94. But until \nwe put in that higher high, which is at around   $98,000 or $99,000, you cannot be bullish again. And so from a bullishness point of view, nothing   changes. We're in exactly, exactly, exactly the \nsame situation. Well, maybe not. Maybe we cleared   one CME gap from earlier this year or earlier \nthis week, but that's it. Nothing else happens. The one thing that is worth noticing though is \nthat yesterday when Trump made the announcement   that he's dropping the tariffs against the \nEU after they reached some kind of deal on   Greenland, what you can see is that gold and \nsilver started to collapse. Not collapse,   gold went down 1.7% and silver went down 2.9%. And at the same time, risk markets went up and   Bitcoin went up."

The one thing that is worth noticing though is that yesterday when Trump made the announcement that he's dropping the tariffs against the EU after they reached some kind of deal on Greenland, what you can see is that gold and silver started to collapse. Not collapse, gold went down 1.7% and silver went down 2.9%. And at the same time, risk markets went up and Bitcoin went up. So the NASDAQ went up, the \nS&P went up, gold went down, silver went down,   and Bitcoin went up 3.6% after that announcement. Now, why am I saying that is because what's clear   is that the market is not treating Bitcoin like \na store of value safe haven asset. In fact,   the exact opposite. The market is treating Bitcoin \nlike a risk-on asset, right? Like a tech stock. And this is what I want to talk to you about \nbecause I think I've uncovered something, right? Because even though the market, the NASDAQ has \nbeen running like crazy, what you can see is that   last year, if you take the whole of last year, \nlet's say from 31st December 2024 till where   we are today, the NASDAQ's up 22.78%. Right? And the thing is that if you look at Bitcoin,   Bitcoin is actually flat. So if you take NASDAQ \nand then we can go to say Bitcoin over here,   what you can see is Bitcoin is flat on that \nsame time period. Basically where Bitcoin   started in the beginning of January 2025 and \nwhere Bitcoin is today is exactly, exactly,   exactly the same level. So a pretty disappointing \nyear for Bitcoin when you compare it to NASDAQ. But then hold on a second. If you dig just a \nlittle bit deeper and look at stocks like for   example Meta, right? And you say okay well where \nwas Meta? Where was Facebook on the 1st of January   2025? So let's just try and find that level. It is \na level that is somewhere here. So, let's just say   that that's close enough. And then where's Meta \ntoday? It actually hasn't moved. Not at all. So,   in fact, it's got exactly the same price point \nas Bitcoin. Hasn't moved. And it's not only Meta,   right? If you look at things like Tesla, right? So, that's where Tesla started the year and that's   where Tesla is now. Basically, hardly any price \nmovement if anything. Actually, a minus 7% price   movement. And so what we're realizing is that \nthe market is actually pricing Bitcoin like a   tech stock. And if you look at the performance \nof tech stocks other than things like Nvidia,   other than things like Google, which we'll \ntalk about in a sec. I'm going to break down   the whole thesis for you in a sec. What you're \nrealizing is that actually Bitcoin performed   exactly like a tech stock. And when you look at \nit on a chart that looks something like this,   you kind of say to yourself, hold on a second. This chart is actually painting a very clear   picture. It's painting a very clear picture when \nthe risk assets, when the market goes risk-on,   when the market goes full risk-on and real \nstocks or all stocks basically start running,   then Bitcoin is going to is basically going to \ngo up. But any investor, whether it was a crypto   investor or whether it was a stocks investor, \nunless you were invested in exactly the right   stocks, and it wasn't even the MAG 7, right? Because not all the MAG 7 actually went up. Then   you basically had the same results as Bitcoin \nunless you were invested in exactly, exactly,   exactly the right sectors. And that's what \nwe'll talk about a little bit later in the show. Right. For now, let's quickly look at what \nhappened yesterday when it came to Davos. As I   said, everyone who's everyone is in Davos. They're \nall there. The mood's good. They're all there. Trump went out and made his speech now. It's \nabout an hour and a half and literally you can   clip every 5 minutes in the speech. It's so good. But these are some of the highlights basically. \"And then after the war, which we won, \nwe won it big."

They're all there. The mood's good. They're all there. Trump went out and made his speech now. It's about an hour and a half and literally you can clip every 5 minutes in the speech. It's so good. But these are some of the highlights basically. \"And then after the war, which we won, we won it big. Without us right now,   you'd all be speaking German and a \nlittle Japanese perhaps. After the war,   we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid \nwere we to do that? But we did it. But we gave   it back. But how ungrateful are they now? So now our country and the world face much   greater risks than it did ever before because of \nmissiles, because of nuclear, because of weapons   of warfare that I can't even talk about. Two weeks \nago they saw weapons that nobody ever heard of.\" So Trump went on about Greenland. He wanted \nGreenland. He wanted his little piece of ice   and he also had a very productive meeting with \nthe Secretary General of NATO who actually formed   a framework for Trump to actually get Greenland. So they do finally have a framework. So he wanted   to get Greenland. He got what he wanted. He got \nhis little piece of ice that he actually did. Now   what's the deal? The deal involves giving small \npockets of land to the US. The US involved in all   the military rights. So they've got the land for \nthe protection. They've got the mineral rights   for the rare earth minerals. The deal duration has \nan indefinite time frame designed to block Russian   influence in Greenland. And by the way, Putin \ncame out afterwards like, \"You guys are wasting   time. We don't want this.\" The US Golden Dome \nwill be involved, which the Golden Dome is the   missile interception systems, and opens the door \nto US-backed infrastructure investment. Right. So he got his land, he got his defense, and he got \nhis minerals. And that's exactly what he wanted. And that's why he said, \"Okay, well, he's going \nto remove the tariffs on the European countries.\" Typical Trump playbook, right? The playbook \nfor Trump is threaten, show the other side   exactly how bad you're going to mess them up, and \nthen reverse and say, \"No, we've been working.\" We'll go back to that. The other thing that he \nspoke about yesterday was the stock markets. And he basically reassured investors that the \nstock market's going to double. Listen to this. \"I mean, our stock market took the first \ndip yesterday because of Iceland. So,   Iceland's already cost us a lot of money, but \nthat dip is peanuts compared to what it's gone   up. And we have an unbelievable future \nin that stock. That stock market is going   to be doubled. We're going to hit 50,000 \nand that stock market's going to double.\" Now, one thing I've learned about Trump, one \nthing I've learned about Trump is whenever he   says something, he delivers it. Right? Like, \nyou know, Trump said he's going to deliver   markets that are running, markets are running. Trump said he's going to deliver the crypto stuff,   he's delivered the crypto stuff. So, when \nI got into investments, people said to me,   \"Never bet against the Fed.\" And I think \nwhat they meant is never bet against what   the President's telling you because this is \nexactly, exactly what's going to happen, right? There were some other highlights which \nI think are very, very, very cool. So,   this is Scott Bessent describing \nGavin Newsom. I think this is classic,   classic. Let me know in the chat what you \nthink about this. Very, very ironic that,   you know, Governor Newsom who strikes me \nas Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken,   may be the only Californian who knows less about \neconomics than Kamala Harris. He's here this week   with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros. And Davos is a perfect place for a man who when   everyone else is on lockdown, when he was \nhaving people arrested for going to church,   he was having thousand-a-night meals at the \nFrench Laundry. And I'm sure the California   people won't forget that. And I mean, so there \nwere politicians actually dinging at one another."

And I'm sure the California people won't forget that. And I mean, so there were politicians actually dinging at one another. Trump also moved on to crypto and kind of assured \nthe market that he's going to get the crypto,   he's going to get the Clarity Act actually passed \nto unleash innovation and savings and financing. \"I'm also working to ensure America remains \nthe crypto capital of the world and to that   end last year I signed the landmark Genius Act \ninto law. Now Congress is working very hard on   crypto market structure legislation, \nBitcoin, all of them which I hope...\" So he's assured people that basically this is \ngoing to be the next thing that that's actually   happened. Now there has been some progress \nmade on the Clarity Act. So the main thing   is that the major thing around the controversial \nstable yield restrictions were removed. So they   didn't deal with it. They just removed it and \nsaid, you know, we're not going to deal with   it and it'll be dealt with somewhere else. Now this is a major, major, major positive   because this was the biggest sticking point and \nby removing it pretty much I think this is going   to happen next week. Now the problem is that the \npoliticians etc. they've moved on to different   bills at the moment and they'll have to come \nback into this and get it done. Hopefully   they can get it done sometime in February if \nthere isn't a government shutdown. So very,   very, very important that we understand that there \ncould be a government shutdown at the end of Jan,   guys. There could be a government shutdown \nagain. Hopefully it doesn't happen though. All right. So this whole tariff trade played out \nexactly, exactly, exactly what we told you when   this thing happened, right? And now basically it's \nfollowing this Kobeissi playbook. The playbook is   that you know first Trump goes nuclear and then \nhe imposes the tariffs and then he doubles down on   the tariffs and then over the weekend they start \nto speak about the willingness to negotiate etc.,   etc. Then the futures open red and they open \nred. Then on Monday and Tuesday they carry on   applying pressure and by Wednesday that week the \ndip buyers came in. So yesterday was Wednesday,   the dip buyers came in. Now what happens here is \nthat typically this rally fails, right? And the   rally only picks up on the following weekend \nwhich means that theoretically if this were   to hold then Monday should be a really good \nweek for markets and we should actually get   some kind of relief rally. Then over the next \ntwo to four weeks various members of the Trump   administration continue to tease progress \nand they'll eventually get an agreement. So with all of this in mind, next week will \nprobably be quite a good week for crypto or   quite a good week for markets. Question is \nwhether or not it's going to be a good week   for crypto and whether or not we can get up to \nlike crazy, crazy, crazy levels. Again, we got to   deal with what's being given to us by the market. And the truth is, if the market gives us $98,000,   then I turn bullish again. But if not, then \nyeah, I think every pump here is a chance to sell   bad tokens that you're currently holding and \nstuff like that. The playbook is exactly the   same every single time. 10% drop on the tariffs to \nCanada, back all the way up. Again EU 50% tariff,   5% drop, bang, straight back up. It's exactly, \nexactly, exactly the same playbook. Expect the   same outcome over here. So maybe we do go \nback up. Question is do we go up above the   $98,000 to give us a healthy chart structure. That's what we're going to keep you covered on. And then the question is, what happens regarding \nBitcoin? Like does it move like a stock?"

That's what we're going to keep you covered on. And then the question is, what happens regarding Bitcoin? Like does it move like a stock? So,   one of the existential threats to Bitcoin is that \nquantum computing threat which has now hit the   markets to scare the markets. Again, I wouldn't be \ntoo scared about it and I have made a video which   the guys are editing and they will drop on Crypto \nInsider. So, as soon as that's ready, we're going   to drop it for you guys. In the meantime, the \nquestion is how Bitcoin will move and whether   it will move like a tech stock or like something \nelse. And that brings us to what we spoke about   earlier in the show where I said to you guys, yes, \nthere are certain stocks that did really, really,   really well last year. Right? So if you look at \nthe 12-month performance on things like Google,   Google was up 70% in 12 months. By the way, Bill \nAckman absolutely, absolutely nailed that trade. Insane how well he's done. Nvidia up 30-35%. Tesla on the 12-month period up 13%. If you   look at this period over here and you look at the \n17th December, you're 11% down here. Microsoft is   1% down. Amazon is 4% down. Meta is 16% down. So I think what it comes down to is to say that   there are very few stocks that have basically \ncarried all the returns of the entire market. Now why am I telling you this is because \nwhen this happens in a cycle generally at   the end of the cycle everything starts to \nrise. So in the beginning of the cycle,   select stocks take up the index and at the end \nof the cycle, it's like everything starts to   rise and everything starts to rise and then \nthat's usually when we get the blow-off top,   right? And so if this is a and it does feel like \nit's a mega cycle, then what we should look at   is we should look to see when the other stocks \nstart moving. Now if Bitcoin starts to track the   other assets, then we could get some kind of \npump. But for now, what we got to do is we   got to play what's given to us. And what's \ngiven to us is a chart breakdown. And we   got to be cautious. Yes. Okay. If Bitcoin \ngoes up, great. But for now, let's remain   cautious and trade what is actually given to \nus every time that it is actually given to us. Okay. I see a message here from Johnny. He says, \n\"We've made a video on how to claim a Blofin   offer.\" Okay, you guys want a blow-off? I give \nyou a Blofin offer. If you open a Blofin account,   you get a $1,000 position today basically. And there's a whole video in the bottom in   the description. There's a video to show you how \nto actually claim that user bonus. Literally like   a step-by-step video. Here's the video. You can \nactually kind of see it over here. Literally gives   you a step-by-step video. Shows you from the time \nthat you take the click, how to open the account,   how to claim the bonus, etc., etc. Um, so open \naccount and get that $1,000 open position. All right, I think that's it for today. I mean,   let's just hope that the market gives us \nsomething better to go with. Otherwise,   I'll see you guys again tomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends."
