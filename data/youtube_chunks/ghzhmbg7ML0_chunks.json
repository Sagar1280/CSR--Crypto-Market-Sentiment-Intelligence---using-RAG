      "text": "Yo, welcome everyone. Bitcoin has gotten a rejection and now they are trying to fool you. So definitely be slightly more careful. And let me show you why. First, you're going to see that our anchored VW was hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy. If you watched yesterday's video and of course also if you do follow me on Twitter yesterday I posted a very important chart where we said the anchored view right here when we anchor it exactly at the high right here is aligning almost perfectly with our liquidity level at 91,700. Both of the levels were hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy because Bitcoin definitely took the liquidity above our recent high right here and only after taking the liquidity and after hitting the anchored VWAP we are right now getting a rejection back towards the downside of let's just say approximately 2%. Also right now this level was not only the liquidity level and the anchored VWAP. Remember from yesterday's video when we go right now on the 4hourly measuring the entire bottom price action with volume. It was also the value area high again the level was hit almost to the exact dollar accuracy and ranked Bitcoin is actually getting some kind of a rejection back towards downside. Also right now I really want to share with you exactly what other people have been doing in the market. The entire time we are getting this specific rejection back down. You can notice Bitcoin definitely is right now still forming another lower high. But pay attention to the CVD indicator the yellow line. It is measuring if buying or selling pressure is coming in market. If we get a push towards the upside buying pressure is coming in. If we get a push towards upside selling pressure is coming in and what you can write to see clearly we are forming another higher high on the CVD indicator which run to simply means buying pressure is coming in market and then additionally we can also pay attention to the open interest indicator which is telling to us if brand new money is coming or leaving the market. So what we can write to see open interest getting a push towards the upside brand new money coming in the market in the form of the buying pressure but Bitcoin is clearly not pushing towards the upside. We are forming another lower high and this right here is going to be a textbook bearish absorption bearish divergence on the CVD indicator and unfortunately also a bearish Bitcoin indication. That is right why in the upcoming hours potentially we might be expecting another push back towards downside and let me right or share with you exactly what are going to be our very important price targets. Yes, right now for complete transparency I still do remain in my long trade on Bitcoin, in the long trade on XRP and also on the other hand I do"

That is right why in the upcoming hours potentially we might be expecting another push back towards downside and let me right or share with you exactly what are going to be our very important price targets. Yes, right now for complete transparency I still do remain in my long trade on Bitcoin, in the long trade on XRP and also on the other hand I do remain in my short trade on Bitcoin and also on the short trade on Ethereum. But of course if we are right going to go even lower potentially I'm still going to be interested to go with another buy position on BTC because definitely another very important level is going to get heat. Now what you're going to see at this specific area we can be identifying a brand new horizontal range. We can write to connect all of our highs right here expanding this one towards upside and because of course we are forming this bearish divergence. Potentially we might be expecting another push towards thumbs. And always remember where is the best time to go with a long or maybe a short trade exactly at the top or maybe even at the bottom of the range. At the bottom of the range we could be looking for brand new buy trades. At the top of the range we might be looking for another short trade. And of course, if we right now know, okay, bearish absorption is right happening, potentially Bitcoin is going to get a rotation back down, hitting the bottom of the range. And right here, you definitely should pay attention because you're not going to blindly enter a buy position immediately after Bitcoin hits the bottom of the range. You really want to see some kind of a reaction back towards the upside because it's not only going to be the bottom of the range, it's also going to be a major liquidations cluster. And before we do talk about it, I would really appreciate for you to smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible. And of course, also thank you for subscribing to the channel. You can write to see if Bitcoin is going to get another push towards downside towards the bottom of the rate right here taking the previous low. Of course, it is going to be a liquidity level, but also when we write a go on the Bitcoin liquidation heat map on the twoe time frame, you can right to see a major liquidation cluster is going to be exactly below our recent low at approximately $89,000. So definitely this specific area is going to be a very important level you should really pay attention to, not only because of the bottom of the range right"

So definitely this specific area is going to be a very important level you should really pay attention to, not only because of the bottom of the range right here, but also because of the liquidations cluster. Now the problem is going to happen if we start pushing even lower because the biggest liquidation cluster on the twoe time frame is not going to be below our recent low but it is actually going to be slightly lower at approximately $86,600. I would still right to say if we do hit the bottom of the range right here if we then do get some kind of a reaction back towards the upside we can then still be looking for a bigger bounce on the Bitcoin price itself simply because what if we right now zoom in a little bit and let's just go on the onee time frame where we are right going to see that yes the biggest liquidation at least when we are zooming in on the one week is actually going to be exactly below our recent low where over 156 million of long trades are going to get fracked are going to get liquidated and then the second biggest liquidation cluster is going to be exactly above the recent highs right here. So definitely in the upcoming hours of course we are maybe even looking for another push down because of the bearish absorption right here but then simply set an alert at the bottom of our horizontal range where potentially we might be looking for some kind of a bounce back towards the upside. right now. What if Bitcoin does not get a bounce at the bottom of the right right here and we simply do get a major collapse back towards downside in this scenario? I still want to talk about a bearish plan. You also definitely should be paying attention to and it's probably going to be something you will probably not like because in this scenario we are going to look for much lower targets literally in the upcoming days and also in the upcoming weeks. what we can write to do. Let's go with our Elliot impulsive wave where we can write or say okay potentially Bitcoin right or finished the entire impulse right here we got a correction and if we start going very impulsively towards downside it is simply going to mean Bitcoin is forming the third all wave then of course we can be expecting the fourth one and only after the fourth one is finished another"

And what is going to be the technical target of our third Ali wave? All we have to do right here is to go with our Fibonacci extension level. So let's go with our trendbased Fibonacci extension. We go exactly from the high back towards the low right here, back towards the high right here. And we need to pay attention towards 1.618 618 Fibonacci extension level that is actually going to come in very very low at approximately $82,800 right here. So definitely if Bitcoin does go lower, yes, we are right now literally expecting a major collapse back towards side with a significant red candle. However, once again, I would say this specific scenario is going to be only more likely after the bottom of the range right here is going to be broken and if there is going to be no reaction back towards the upside. This right here is definitely something you should be paying attention to just in case the market is going to collapse. But also right now on the other hand what is going to be a bullish indication where potentially we can then say okay much higher targets on Bitcoin are then definitely going to be much more likely. What you can write to see remember our value area high we got by measuring the entire bottom price action. This specific level in my opinion is right now still the most important one simply because if broken towards the upside happy days for Bitcoin and probably then we are going to look for much higher targets very very soon. The $92,000 area is right now in my opinion one of the most important level you should really pay attention. So clearly you can write to see how I'm making my exact plan. I'm not saying to you we must go up or we must go down. Looking at the CVD indicator, I would actually say there is right now a higher probability Bitcoin does get another push down."

I'm not saying to you we must go up or we must go down. Looking at the CVD indicator, I would actually say there is right now a higher probability Bitcoin does get another push down. However, pushing towards the downside simply could potentially offer us another buy trade if there is going to be some kind of a reaction at the bottom of the range. If there is no reaction, simply then we are going to look for lower. Our short trades are going to be in an even bigger profit. But also, my trading bots are actually going to be buying the dip. Yes, right now both of the trading bots, Bitcoin and Ethereum trading bot have been performing very very nicely. And yes, if we are going to go lower, Bitcoin bot is going to be buying all the way down towards $65,000. And the Ethereum trading bot is also going to be buying all the way down towards $2,000. So right now, if you want to use my exact trading bots that are actually buying the DB, you can sign up on Pionex using this specific link down below in the description.

Right now, let's also talk about what has been happening on the ATR stoastic CG oscillator on the daily time frame because right here it actually does look like we are curving once again back towards downside. And this right here can actually be some kind of a bullish indication for Bitcoin once we are going to hit the oversold area which potentially it is going to happen tomorrow. This is then going to mean we are oversold on the ethlers and last time we were in the oversold area, Bitcoin definitely got another push towards the upside. Also, we were oversold. Bitcoin got another push towards the upside. So, definitely this specific indication if we are going to be in the oversold area is going to be a bullish thing for Bitcoin. Now, one could write a mention to me, bro, when you go on the daily"

Bitcoin got another push towards the upside. So, definitely this specific indication if we are going to be in the oversold area is going to be a bullish thing for Bitcoin. Now, one could write a mention to me, bro, when you go on the daily time frame. But applying the MACD indicator on the chart, you're right going to see we do have a confirmed bearish divergence. Especially if we right to go on the line chart, you can right to see that yes, Bitcoin definitely formed a very slight higher high right here. But on the MACD indicator, we are getting a lower high. So this right here, technically speaking, is a regular bearish divergence or a bearish Bitcoin indication. However, only because of this right here, I wouldn't really write to say to you that we should necessarily be looking straight towards the downside for Bitcoin to take the liquidity below the recent low. Let's try to simply trade from level to level. Let's right now first of all see if our horizontal range right here is going to maybe even be able to get a major breakout towards the upside because if so, definitely we are looking for another higher high right here for Bitcoin to go above $95,000. And also right now when we go with our exponential moving averages, yes, unfortunately on the 1 hour time frame, we just got a bearish cross right here. This technically speaking is also a bearish indication for Bitcoin on the 1 hourly. However, on the 2hourly and also on the 4hourly, we are still moving in an uptrend right here. So that is why right now I definitely don't want to say to you we are right now already looking for a major push down already or maybe even a bigger push up. Overall speaking on the 4hourly and 2 hourly we are still being right here slightly more bullish. That is why if we are going to get another push down maybe taking the liquidity below our recent low right here maybe also then below this one definitely I would say monitor the reaction below our recent lows and if there is going to be a reaction back towards the upside you can still potentially be looking to fire another long or buy trade with the invalidation below our horizontal range targeting clearly another higher high right here. Also when we go with our crypto fear and greed index we are right up being literally in the neutral zone because we just hit the 40 level. So this indicator right here is also I would say in some kind of an indecision."

So this indicator right here is also I would say in some kind of an indecision. It is not really screaming buy if of course we would be in the extreme fear area and it's also not really screaming sell if we would be in the extreme greet area. So right now it is definitely a decision time for Bitcoin. Are we going to be able to get a breakout towards the upside out of the horizontal range? Again, we do not have to know in which direction Bitcoin is going to go for us to make money in the market. On the way down, if we get a reaction looking for a buy trade, if there is no reaction, looking for lower targets and definitely then our short trade on Bitcoin and also on Ethereum is going to be in an even bigger profit. But also then definitely the lower we are going to go, the more trading bots are actually going to be buying the DEP.
