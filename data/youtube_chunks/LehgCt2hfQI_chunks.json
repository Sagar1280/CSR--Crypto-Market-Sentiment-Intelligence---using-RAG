      "text": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coin Bureau Trading. Today, we're going to talk about why the crypto market is rallying and whether the rally will continue. This is the kind of content that you enjoy. Then, be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different. And if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, when it comes to why the crypto market is pumping, guys, it's actually pretty interesting because you might remember from yesterday I was mentioning that it would probably depend on what happened uh with the tariffs. And of course, we didn't get any decision on the tariffs. Um, but if you guys watched until the end of yesterday's video, you'll know that I had pointed out an interesting dynamic, and that's that historically when we see large cap stocks breaking down, sometimes we actually see a rotation into small cap stocks. And what's really fascinating is that's exactly what we saw yesterday. And I actually noted that at the end of yesterday's video basically saying that hey you know there could be some issue related to banks or whatever that causes large cap stocks to fall but small cap stocks could rally. And why is this important guys? Well as some of you will know small cap stocks are highly correlated to crypto. They're kind of indicative of the uh I guess idea that liquidity is flowing further out the risk curve into higher risk assets. So it should come as no surprise that we're seeing small cap stocks and crypto rally together while larger uh larger stocks are basically pulling back. But by the way, is kind of like a sign of like late stage cycle behavior. Doesn't mean that prices are going to go down tomorrow, but it does mean, believe it or not, that we could be entering the most speculative phase uh of the markets. Um and uh again, that tends to happen when you have this rotation out of large cap stocks further down the risk curve, which we've been kind of been waiting for now for a very long time. It looks like it's finally starting. Uh but anyways, this of course begs the question of whether the rally is going to continue. Well, if you guys have been keeping up with my content, you know that the main thing that I've been watching here uh is the uh is the Clarity Act discussion which was supposed to be uh discussed later today. Uh but as you guys might have heard, the Senate has basically postponed this discussion indefinitely. There's going to be going going to be another discussion by different Senate committee"

Well, if you guys have been keeping up with my content, you know that the main thing that I've been watching here uh is the uh is the Clarity Act discussion which was supposed to be uh discussed later today. Uh but as you guys might have heard, the Senate has basically postponed this discussion indefinitely. There's going to be going going to be another discussion by different Senate committee later this month. But this uh discussion that was supposed to happen today, this was like the most important one. And I had been noting that, you know, I part of the reason why I thought crypto prices would rally this month was that we would see prices rallying into the Clarity Act discussions the same way that we saw with the Genius Act, that before the Genius Act was passed, crypto prices were already picking up. That was in the summer of last year. Um, but of course with this happening, you guys might be wondering, uh, okay, well, is does this mean that the rally is not going to happen? Does this mean we're going to get a pullback? The answer, guys, is no, because again, there's another catalyst that I've been flagging as well, and that's this SEC innovation exemption, which is still expected by the end of January. I really do hope they deliver this. Uh for those of you who don't know, the the SEC's kind of innovation exemption would basically legalize everything in crypto in the US temporarily specifically focusing on like tokenized assets. Uh and you know whether it's like DeFi or uh you know all anything you can think of like anything that's onchain airrops um like a social all these different kind of niches that really need regulatory clarity to grow. uh and uh basically what it would do again is it would temporarily legalize everything uh basically until Clarity Act regulations go into force. And so paradoxically, you could make the argument that now that the Clarity Act is kind of being delayed, uh if the SEC comes in with an innovation exemption, the longer that the Clarity Act is delayed, the longer that you have a situation where basically everything is legal in the US, assuming this innovation exemption comes in uh later this month, which again, this is what Paul Atkins, the chair of the SEC, this is what he said in December of last year. He said that by the end of January, roughly in a month's time, sometime in January at the latest, uh we would have the innovation exemption in place. And it wouldn't be farfetched to say that maybe the innovation exemption was kind of like a plan B in case uh US politicians were unable to come to an agreement about the Clarity"

And it wouldn't be farfetched to say that maybe the innovation exemption was kind of like a plan B in case uh US politicians were unable to come to an agreement about the Clarity Act that the SEC is like, don't worry, uh we got you covered, crypto industry. Uh you know, because the crypto industry has been lobbying them a lot. um you know, don't worry, we'll introduce this innovation exemption and you'll be able to do whatever you want, even if the politicians are unable to pass the Clarity Act, which again looks like it could take some time to happen. Anyways, uh finally brings us to the charts here. Of course, on Bitcoin, we're looking at Bitcoin on the 4hour chart here. You can see there's a little bit of a bearish divergence uh between a momentum and price. I was actually I was I guess you could say on the one hand surprised that we got a another leg higher, but then again, not really. We still haven't seen you could say like a proper like really really massive breakout here. um in my mind and you could, you know, feel free to disagree in the comments, but this price action that we've seen over the last 24 hours or so. Yes, it's like a pretty decent rally, but it's also pretty choppy. I would say there's been bigger rallies of course among certain altcoins, but this price action again is like, you know, you're still waiting for a really really big kind of like up thrust higher. Uh, and I should note guys that, you know, I'm sure a lot of people that you follow on social media or whether it's on YouTube or X or whatever, they're all talking about how, oh, crypto is going to rally up to whatever it is 105,000 or sorry, Bitcoin is going to rally to around 105,000 or 107,000. I actually think that the target in the short term is actually a little bit lower. I think it's closer to around 100,000, maybe 102,000. And it kind of makes sense cuz like everyone, you know, everyone that I see who's who's doing this analysis, they're all saying that when Bitcoin rallies up to 105 or 107,000, that's a bare market rally. I'm going to sell at that level and I'm going to get out, right? And so what do you think that's going to what impact that's going to have on the price? Well, the closer that we get to 105,000, the more that people are going to start kind of front"

Well, the closer that we get to 105,000, the more that people are going to start kind of front running that and which is consistent with the Ballinger band moving average here on the weekly that Bitcoin would actually, let's say, hit a local top of somewhere around 101,000 and then get a pullback before either continuing higher or continuing lower. Um, I don't think it's going to go all the way up to this 107 105,000 level that literally everyone is watching simply because everyone is watching that level and planning on getting out at that level. Uh, of course I do need to address, of course, the liquidation heat map. This is where things also get kind of interesting. Uh, as a fun fact, guys, I believe that yesterday's video where I mentioned the liquidation heat map and like uh market makers trying to grab liquidity. I believe that was the first time I mentioned liquidation heat map in my videos. And to be honest, I don't really use it in my own personal analysis. And this is kind of a reason why is you can see that today's liquidation heat map looks completely different than the one from yesterday. And what that basically means guys is that every single time there's a change in crypto prices. Uh the kind of levels of for liquidations will change because like it's not like traders are just like yeah I'm just going to wait until prices fall or rise until my level and get liquidated right. Um traders will typically let's say for example uh if they're at risk of liquidation then they will take their positions off to make sure that they don't get liquidated. And the result is that this kind of a, you know, liquidity wall here that market makers want to quote unquote grab, that wall basically disappears because all the traders who can see that prices are rising are taking off their positions before they actually get liquidated, if that makes any sense. So, this is why I don't really use these heat maps in my own personal analysis. I just thought it was interesting, something that could potentially, you know, be supportive of a pullback in the short term. Uh but uh let's just say I probably won't be mentioning liquidation heat maps again after today's video because again these levels change as prices change and so it doesn't really make these liquidation heat maps all that helpful in my honest opinion. But"

Uh but uh let's just say I probably won't be mentioning liquidation heat maps again after today's video because again these levels change as prices change and so it doesn't really make these liquidation heat maps all that helpful in my honest opinion. But if you do believe in liquidation heat maps then we do have a let's say a pocket of liquidity here that market makers want to grab it around 98,000. So potentially indicative of a rally higher in the coming days. But again that's what I was mentioning yesterday that there was a pocket of liquidity down around 93,000 which has now you know looks like it's basically disappeared. Um, so I wouldn't, again, I wouldn't really take this as a gospel here. I I wouldn't personally use it in my analysis and that's why I don't. Um, anyways, moving on to Ethereum. Similar idea. We have an even more aggressive kind of bearish divergence here on the 4 hour with like a higher high uh in price, but a lower high in the RSI. So, it shows that momentum is slowing down, which would be indicative of a short-term kind of pullback. But again, like you can see very clearly here over the last um 24 hours, this isn't really a rally. This is more like chop. And that's what I had mentioned would kind of be my base case, like a little bit of a pullback, very slight pullback. In Ethereum's case, it's interesting. It actually did kind of like grab that liquidity. Um, so, you know, again, maybe the liquidation heat map isn't completely useless after all. Um, but in all seriousness, uh, it it is interesting to see that Ethereum did get a little bit pull back into that zone that I had mentioned yesterday, just below 3,300. Then it continued higher. Looked like it was about to break out. Then it got a rejection again, and now it's just chopping. Uh, and I do think that my base case honestly for the next couple of days would be chop, maybe a slight pullback. Again, not calling for any kind of significant uh uh pump or dump. I do think that it's going to really depend on what happens here with the SEC's innovation exemption. But with that being said, uh I also do think you need to keep a very close eye on the Russell 2000 because if the Russell 2000 continues grinding higher, then we could see Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market grinding higher despite all these divergences simply because you're finally starting to see liquidity flow further out the risk"

And again, historically speaking, a breakout in the Russell 2000 translated to a breakout in uh the crypto market, especially altcoins. And we are seeing that breakout basically as of the start of January essentially. So that's something to keep in the back of your mind. I'm sure many of you are going to mention in the comments, well, uh the US is going to strike Iran or whatever and there's going to be a huge uh crisis. That's certainly possible and if it was to happen, then it would probably happen tomorrow because the Trump administration likes to do a lot of crazy stuff on Fridays and over the weekend. But what's really fascinating is the Washington Post actually reported uh yesterday uh that there was basically um you know communications between Israel and Iran that they had basically agreed uh not to preemptively attack each other which is really f and the most fascinating part is that they made this agreement not through the United States but through Russia. So it kind of shows Russia like basically brokering peace between these two parties which is very you know interesting but at the same time I guess not surprising of course Russia is an ally of Iran and Israel actually does have close ties to Russia. There's a lot of history there that I'm sure people in the comments know better than I do. Um, but the point being is that uh yeah, I don't think that there's any big risk of Iran striking Israel or or vice versa. Uh I know you've seen probably a lot of stuff in terms of like polyarket bets and a whole bunch of stuff online, but as people like to say, bull markets like to climb a wall of worry and even though we are seeing again a pullback in large cap stocks, small cap stocks are starting to take off. Uh, and uh, I think that this is kind of like a um, this this kind of like potential tension between Iran and Israel and US getting involved is something that's kind of like very useful to uh, to that kind of keeps people off sides as prices just continue creeping higher in Bitcoin, Ethereum, small cap stocks and and elsewhere. Um, anyways guys, so if you are trading then do check out the link in"
