      "text": "Bullish sentiment is once again looking like it's \nreturned to the market. But there's a few onchain   pieces of evidence that suggest that actually the \nlongerterm picture is not so bullish. Today we're   going to be going through exactly what those \npieces are, why some people have got it wrong,   and my plan for the initial part of 2026. This \nvideo is for information and entertainment   only. It reflects my personal opinions and is not \nfinancial advice. Check the description for more   information. Always do your own research. Okay, so \nfirst off, we're seeing this chart is being shown   around everywhere, right? Whales and exchanges \nwith more than 1,000 Bitcoin balance change in   30 days. And you can see this massive, massive, \nmassive blue tick right here. Bang. I mean,   it's just like completely ridiculous relative \nto the rest of the data being shared here. It's   being shared here, being shared here. This is \nbasically the same thing realized cap for new   whales. So like the price they bought it at and \nbeing shown here as well, just the new Bitcoin   whales are buying at an unprecedented pace. This \nis absolutely not the case. Okay, what this is   is a bunch of exchanges have consolidated their \nholdings into a few addresses just for security   purposes. It's not as bullish as it looks here. Okay, what you've actually got on chain is the   reverse to be honest. It's not anywhere near as \nbullish. And so what this shows you is the exact   same sort of thing just with exchanges removed. And you can see that actually across 30 days,   total whale Bitcoin holdings have gone down \nacross 30 days. But it's nowhere near as bullish   and actually looks the same for smaller, you know, \nholders as well. People with 100 to 1,000 Bitcoin   have also been month-on-month in terms of their \npercentage change decreasing their holdings. So,   it's opposite to whales are buying a bunch. And actually, you can see that playing out   here. This is the Bitcoin apparent demand. So, how much demand is there for Bitcoin,   right? And this is since all history. And you \ncan see that when it's green, there's a lot of   demand. And you know, when it's red, there's \nnowhere near as much demand. Well, actually,   there's selling pressure when it's red and there's \nbuying pressure when it's green. And this has just   ticked down to like negative territory. So, \nthere's more sell pressure than buy pressure   right now. And zoomed in, it looks a bit like \nthis. Okay, so this is in the last year. Look,   basically, Bitcoin right now has negative demand \non a 30-day rolling period. Not surprising. Price   has gone down. The market hasn't had that brutal \nSailor bid for a while because they've been   accumulating cash as opposed to Bitcoin. You \nknow, make of that whatever you will. So I was   sort of like okay what what would it be like if \nSailor wasn't there and you know supposedly based   upon this model that Claude built 13 and a half \npercent further downside if MicroStrategy weren't   a buyer to the downside this is over the course \nof the last few years since 2022 basically this is   like Sailor's impact by year and so this is on the \napparent demand okay so how much of the demand for   Bitcoin was Sailor demand and supposedly this is \nhow it looks on a chart right so in the green bars   are actual Bitcoin demand. This same chart here \nand the orange bars are how much Bitcoin basically   Sailor bought during that period. And you can \nsee like when Sailor buys a lot of Bitcoin,   he makes up a decent chunk of that onchain \ndemand. So look at this bar here, massive   green bar of demand. Sailor made 75 percent of \nthat demand. So supposedly based upon this data,   Sailor was making up 75 percent of the demand for \nBitcoin in that period. Basically, this just says,   look, MicroStrategy, they have been the marginal \nbuyer for a long time. Does this mean Bitcoin   price can't go up until they start buying a bunch \nmore Bitcoin again? Not necessarily. No. But maybe   a good time to look for the full market reversal \nis when they stop accumulating cash and they start   really start deploying a bunch of money into \nbuying Bitcoin again. You can see like when   he is buying big, there's a lot of Bitcoin \ndemand and actually when he's buying small,   there's actually outflows to Bitcoin. And again, \njust more onchain data to say, look, things aren't   really that bullish onchain, to be honest. What \nthis is is the monthly pace of capital net flow   into Bitcoin across 30 days."

And again, just more onchain data to say, look, things aren't really that bullish onchain, to be honest. What this is is the monthly pace of capital net flow into Bitcoin across 30 days. And what you can \nsee is it turns negative in late December,   ending one of the longest uninterrupted periods of \npositive capital inflow in Bitcoin's history. So,   and so this chart here with all the sort of like \ngreen underneath it, this is basically saying,   look, this is the net flow into Bitcoin during \nthis period. Enormous and it lasted absolutely   ages, but it's just turned negative. And \nactually, when it turns negative in the past,   it doesn't go brutally negative. But it does stay \nnegative for a bit of time, or at least it takes a   long time before we start to see those same kinds \nof inflows. In 2018, it was sort of like trading   around this zero line for a while, but it wasn't \nanywhere near like it was before. And then again,   at the end of 2021, there was like a 6-month \nperiod here, and then again in the bear markets   in 2022. It was quite a long time down there. So \nto expect this to just turn around, I think is   probably based on history, you know, is not a very \ngood bet to take. And this deceleration in capital   inflows has coincided perfectly with long-term \nholders increasing their loss realization. Okay,   so people who've held Bitcoin for a while have \nbeen selling at a loss. And this structure   of like long-term holders selling is typically \nreflects growing timebased investor fatigue which   is a common characteristic of extended bearish \nphases. So look onchain doesn't look amazing. It says things are relatively bearish. They have \nbeen bearish for a bit and generally when they get   this bearish it doesn't immediately turn around. Now if Bitcoin runs to 100K 110K these numbers   don't exactly suddenly change. Okay, for this \nonchain data to suddenly start being very very   different. You actually need a complete reversal. You need Bitcoin to get above 105 110K and stay   there for a little bit. Just getting to 100K won't \ncorrect any of this pretty much. And of course,   perhaps unsurprisingly, ETF flows have been \nnegative as well. You know, obviously they're a   large portion of the actual total inflows anyway. You could argue that maybe this was just the   December tax loss harvesting thing. So onchain \ndata from Glassnode, this was two weeks ago,   okay? And we had the short-term coster basis \nat basically 102K. Active invested mean at like   88K. And I just want to show you how this has \nchanged in the last two weeks. The short-term   coster basis has come down. So not surprisingly as \nprice is underneath this level now we're starting   to starting to see the short-term coster basis \ncome down. And all this looks like on the chart   right is look the short-term coster basis which \nis we just saw that level like 99 almost 100K   is lining up perfectly with the 50-week moving \naverage. Realized price at the bottom is lining up   perfectly with the 200-week moving average. And so \nwe're trading right here right now sort of between   this true mean and the short-term coster basis. But the short-term coster basis every week is   just sort of trending down just like the 50-week \nmoving averages. I think this is going to provide   pretty brutal overhead support to be honest. I \nreally think we test this level much more likely   than we break this 81K level. But unless unless \nBitcoin can break above and hold above 107K,   this is just a lower high and a macro lower high \nat that and we probably should expect further   downside. Onchain is saying, \"Look, things don't \nlook great. I know we've seen a few green days in   January so far. I know we've seen some real heavy \ncompression in volatility in this kind of region   here as well. But my base case is that we retest \nhere, we come down lower."

I really think we test this level much more likely than we break this 81K level. But unless unless Bitcoin can break above and hold above 107K, this is just a lower high and a macro lower high at that and we probably should expect further downside. Onchain is saying, \"Look, things don't look great. I know we've seen a few green days in January so far. I know we've seen some real heavy compression in volatility in this kind of region here as well. But my base case is that we retest here, we come down lower. Now, everyone's going to   be super bullish here and probably it's going to \nbe hard to remain bearish when price gets there. But I'm going to try and stay pretty neutral. Unless Bitcoin breaks above 107K, holds there on,   you know, daily time frame, weekly time frame. If \nit can do that, then I'm just going to completely   change my bias. Yes, fine. Complete bull mode. But unless that happens, then my base case is   that the middle of Q1, you know, we're probably \ngoing to see further downside action. However,   as I've been saying for a long time, I've actually \nbeen relatively bullish in these areas for a trade   because I think it's much more likely we hit 100K \nthan than we break below this previous wick level,   81K. And now for some slightly more bullish pieces \nof news. Look, sentiment is absolutely dead,   right? And when sentiment gets this dead, \ntypically it's good. We saw here sentiment was   dead. Like fear and greed was completely in the \ndead in the water. It worked out here. It worked   out here, here, here, here, here. All these were \ngreat buying opportunities. Now, it didn't work   every single time. These little like exclamation \npoints and these red crosses are when just buying   fear didn't work. And you can see that actually \nlike when things are bad, when things are really   in a bear market, it comes it can stay down \nfor a very, very long time. So just because   sentiment is bad right now, it doesn't mean it \nmust immediately reverse. Just think back a month,   everyone said sentiment is rubbish. It's not going \nto get any better. It could only get better. You   know, it got worse. Just because things are bad \ndoesn't mean they necessarily need to immediately   reverse. But it is worth having that kind of like \nthought process of okay, things are bad now. If I   zoom out 6 months, 12 months, will I be happy or \nsad if I get things wrong here? For example, if I   buy Bitcoin here, am I going to be brutally upset \nif it goes to 60K? Not really. I'm just going to   be quite happy that it's gone to 60K and I'll buy \nsome at 60K as well. And again, another thing that   just says look, Bitcoin is good value here most \nlikely. It doesn't mean it can't go lower. This   is the Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. And if you don't know \nwhat the Sharpe ratio is, it just sort of like is   a way of saying are the risk adjusted returns for \nthis asset worth it. Because if you're getting bad   returns and it's super risky, definitely not. But if you're getting good returns and it's   super risky, then actually, you know, it probably \nis worth it. So what you can see is that every   time the Sharpe ratio of Bitcoin has hit minus \none, they've been absolutely incredible buying   opportunities. Maybe it never hits these levels \nagain. You know, maybe it does, but right now it's   trading at a Sharpe ratio of about zero. Again, \nthat's been a good time to buy Bitcoin in the   past, but it hasn't mean that it can't go lower. You know, you could have bought it here, it went a   bit lower. You could have bought it here, it went \nlower and it stayed lower. You could have bought   it here, it went a bit lower. You could have \nbought it here, bang, caught the bottom. Could   have bought it here, went lower for about a year. Not necessarily a bad time to buy Bitcoin overall. However, it often went lower. And just to sort of \nlike highlight where we are right now, this is the   funding heat map for all of crypto across the last \n30 days."

And just to sort of like highlight where we are right now, this is the funding heat map for all of crypto across the last 30 days. Taking on positions right now, especially   in like Bitcoin, you can be paid to go long. You \nknow, this is a minus 3 percent interest rate. So,   just think about that. You get paid to long \nBitcoin. Bitcoin is trading like 90,000 dollars. I   mean, imagine going back, you know, 4 years and \nthinking Bitcoin is going to 90K and you're going   to get paid to long it. It's the equivalent \nof Bitcoin being, you know, 140 160K in four   years and being paid to go long. Then just quickly \nguys, I want to tell you about Easy Bitcoin. This   segment is sponsored by Easy Bitcoin. They're part \nof the Easy Group family and Easy Bitcoin operate   a recurring purchase service for Bitcoin. The \nservice functions through scheduled card payments   at userdefined intervals. Upon processing payment, \nthe company purchase Bitcoin and transfers it to   a users specified address. The service operates in \na non-custodial basis, meaning purchase Bitcoin is   sent directly to the users's controlled wallet \nwithout being held on the platform. This means   users can choose how much they want a DCA, how \nfrequently they want a DCA, and it's never held by   Easy Bitcoin. It's always held in the user's own \nwallet. Easy Bitcoin is not available in the UK. And this information is provided for educational \npurposes only and does not constitute financial   advice or a promotion. Cryptocurrency investments \ncarry significant risks including total loss of   capital. Always do your own research. Thank you so \nmuch to Easy Bitcoin for sponsoring this portion   of the video. And we've obviously also got a \nbunch of macro catalysts. Arguably should be   pushing the economy forward. Okay, so this is the \nPMI. You've probably seen the PMI 100 times. The   blue line is the PMI. In these little red \nboxes, we've got quantitative tightening. So when the Federal Reserve is pulling out money \nfrom the economy, what you can see is that look,   during times of QT, the PMI tends to contract. And actually that coincides pretty nicely with   pullbacks in Total 3's market cap. This is market \ncap Total 3. Everything except Bitcoin, ETH,   stable coins. When this is pulling back, when \nthe PMI is pulling back, when QT is ongoing, we   tend to see a pullback in this group of altcoins. It doesn't mean that when end to QT ends though,   suddenly we just blast off. Actually, last time \nQT ended, it still took, you know, 440 days   before price really broke above that level and and \nrallied on. Again though, you can see that when   the PMI began to contract, Total 3 began to pull \nback pretty much. Yes, it made one higher high,   but you know, for the most part, this would \nhave been a great place to sell, wouldn't it? And QT began. Yes, prices were already pulling \nback anyway. They'd already pulled back quite   a lot to be honest, but during this contraction, \nwe've just seen prices really sort of bleed out   into that bear market low. We haven't seen the PMI \nexpand yet. What could make the PMI expand? Well,   one interesting leading indicator for the PMI is \nChicago. This is Chicago's business barometer,   which is Chicago's PMI relative to the PMI of the \nUS. And you can see that with Chicago being the   purple one, it tends to kind of like lead, right? And the reason Chicago tends to lead is because   Chicago's data is released slightly earlier. And \nit generally signals direction because a lot of   the sort of trade in the US kind of goes through \nChicago. So they see things show up in sort of   orders prior to the rest of the US. And obviously \nreadings of sub 50 mean economic contraction. Companies are literally reporting worse data this \nmonth than they were in the previous month."

And obviously readings of sub 50 mean economic contraction. Companies are literally reporting worse data this month than they were in the previous month. We've   got the next reading on January 5th, so you know \non Monday and we can actually gleam a little bit   of information from Chicago. And so Chicago \nactually had their latest reading on the 30th   of December it was released still in contraction. They had a reading of 43.5. So they're still under   50, but they had a big jump, a 7 percentage point \nincrease from the 38 low that they had last month. And this actually was a beating of expectations \nby seven. So they beat the expectations of the   number by seven. And what you have seen in the \npast is that when Chicago beats expectations,   so what the market thinks is going to hit in \nterms of its PMI number by three points or more,   the ISM beats its forecast 70 percent of the time. The ISM expectations are 48.4 70 percent of the   time. When Chicago beats by three or more, US \nnational PMI also beats, right? So it wouldn't   be surprising to see an upside surprise here. And \nof course, an upside surprise would mean that this   PMI here gets above this 50 line and then maybe we \ncan start to see economic expansion. My base case   is not that this happens immediately. It takes a \nvery very long time for these things to actually   come to fruition and end up playing out. But \nChicago can help us give a idea of whether or not   the the US's national PMI is going to be turning \naround. And again, just this is what Bitcoin looks   like against the PMI. Probably seen it 100 times, \nbut when QT ends doesn't necessarily mean Bitcoin   just necessarily rallies. When QT ends, again, it \ndoesn't necessarily mean the PMI must immediately   turn around. It is a real help, though. And \nactually, QT has now ended. I think the Federal   Reserve added a little bit of money to their \nbalance sheet over the last few weeks as well, you   know, so this is actually going to be reversing \nsoon, and we're going to start to see more money   push into the economy. Liquidity is coming back \nagain. It's just not something that necessarily   gets shown in asset prices immediately, especially \nif this money isn't filtering its way down through   to the people who are really driving, you know, \nasset prices, crypto prices especially upwards,   who are obviously people who are not just \ninvesting passively in, you know, their 401ks. And guys, before I go, I just want to really quick \ntell you about today's sponsor, Ledger. Massive   shout out to Ledger for sponsoring today's video. Thank you very much to them. If you haven't got a   hardware wallet, guys, you need a hardware wallet \nif you're in crypto. Cannot go around holding all   your tokens in some hot wallet just existing \non your Chrome account. Get yourself a hardware   wallet. Put your crypto on it. I mean, honestly, \nthese are also great presents. I mean, we're kind   of past Christmas now, but Ledger giving you 10 \nbucks of Bitcoin with any purchase. For me, I just   get these ones here. The the S+ and the Nano X. These are the ones I use all the time. The Nano   X is Bluetooth. Very, very convenient. The S+ is \nwired. Lots less convenient, but, you know, super   cheap. For 40 bucks, you can basically secure your \ncrypto. Guys, please, please, please don't have   your crypto sitting just in a hot wallet. It must \nbe secured offline. It's awesome to see markets   are green. I think this year is going to provide a \nlot of opportunities. I just think it's not worth   getting carried away, getting swept up with uber \nbullish sentiment and just having a clear idea   of what you want to get out of the year because \njust buying things, holding them, and praying is   obviously not the strategy."
