      "text": "Bullish sentiment is once again looking like it's returned to the market. But there's a few onchain pieces of evidence that suggest that actually the longerterm picture is not so bullish. Today we're going to be going through exactly what those pieces are, why some people have got it wrong, and my plan for the initial part of 2026. This video is for information and entertainment only. It reflects my personal opinions and is not financial advice. Check the description for more information. Always do your own research. Okay, so first off, we're seeing this chart is being shown around everywhere, right? Whales and exchanges with more than 1,000 Bitcoin balance change in 30 days. And you can see this massive, massive, massive blue tick right here. Bang. I mean, it's just like completely ridiculous relative to the rest of the data being shared here. It's being shared here, being shared here. This is basically the same thing realized cap for new whales. So like the price they bought it at and being shown here as well, just the new Bitcoin whales are buying at an unprecedented pace. This is absolutely not the case. Okay, what this is is a bunch of exchanges have consolidated their holdings into a few addresses just for security purposes. It's not as bullish as it looks here. Okay, what you've actually got on chain is the reverse to be honest. It's not anywhere near as bullish. And so what this shows you is the exact same sort of thing just with exchanges removed. And you can see that actually across 30 days, total whale Bitcoin holdings have gone down across 30 days. But it's nowhere near as bullish and actually looks the same for smaller, you know, holders as well. People with 100 to 1,000 Bitcoin have also been month-on-month in terms of their percentage change decreasing their holdings. So, it's opposite to whales are buying a bunch. And actually, you can see that playing out here. This is the Bitcoin apparent demand. So, how much demand is there for Bitcoin, right? And this is since all history. And you can see that when it's green, there's a lot of demand. And you know, when it's red, there's nowhere near as much demand. Well, actually, there's selling pressure when it's red and there's buying pressure when it's green. And this has just ticked down to like negative territory. So, there's more sell pressure than buy pressure right now. And zoomed in, it looks a bit like this. Okay, so this is in the last year. Look, basically, Bitcoin right now has negative demand on a 30-day rolling period. Not surprising. Price has gone down. The market hasn't had that brutal Sailor bid for a while because they've been accumulating cash as opposed to Bitcoin. You know, make of that whatever you will. So I was sort of like okay what what would it be like if Sailor wasn't there and you know supposedly based"

The market hasn't had that brutal Sailor bid for a while because they've been accumulating cash as opposed to Bitcoin. You know, make of that whatever you will. So I was sort of like okay what what would it be like if Sailor wasn't there and you know supposedly based upon this model that Claude built 13 and a half percent further downside if MicroStrategy weren't a buyer to the downside this is over the course of the last few years since 2022 basically this is like Sailor's impact by year and so this is on the apparent demand okay so how much of the demand for Bitcoin was Sailor demand and supposedly this is how it looks on a chart right so in the green bars are actual Bitcoin demand. This same chart here and the orange bars are how much Bitcoin basically Sailor bought during that period. And you can see like when Sailor buys a lot of Bitcoin, he makes up a decent chunk of that onchain demand. So look at this bar here, massive green bar of demand. Sailor made 75 percent of that demand. So supposedly based upon this data, Sailor was making up 75 percent of the demand for Bitcoin in that period. Basically, this just says, look, MicroStrategy, they have been the marginal buyer for a long time. Does this mean Bitcoin price can't go up until they start buying a bunch more Bitcoin again? Not necessarily. No. But maybe a good time to look for the full market reversal is when they stop accumulating cash and they start really start deploying a bunch of money into buying Bitcoin again. You can see like when he is buying big, there's a lot of Bitcoin demand and actually when he's buying small, there's actually outflows to Bitcoin. And again, just more onchain data to say, look, things aren't really that bullish onchain, to be honest. What this is is the monthly pace of capital net flow into Bitcoin across 30 days. And what you can see is it turns negative in late December, ending one of the longest uninterrupted periods of positive capital inflow in Bitcoin's history. So, and so this chart here with all the sort of like green underneath it, this is basically saying, look, this is the net flow into Bitcoin during this period. Enormous and it lasted absolutely ages, but it's just turned negative. And actually, when it turns negative in the past, it doesn't go brutally negative. But it does stay negative for a bit of time, or at least it takes a long time before we start to see those same kinds of inflows. In 2018, it was"

But it does stay negative for a bit of time, or at least it takes a long time before we start to see those same kinds of inflows. In 2018, it was sort of like trading around this zero line for a while, but it wasn't anywhere near like it was before. And then again, at the end of 2021, there was like a 6-month period here, and then again in the bear markets in 2022. It was quite a long time down there. So to expect this to just turn around, I think is probably based on history, you know, is not a very good bet to take. And this deceleration in capital inflows has coincided perfectly with long-term holders increasing their loss realization. Okay, so people who've held Bitcoin for a while have been selling at a loss. And this structure of like long-term holders selling is typically reflects growing timebased investor fatigue which is a common characteristic of extended bearish phases. So look onchain doesn't look amazing. It says things are relatively bearish. They have been bearish for a bit and generally when they get this bearish it doesn't immediately turn around. Now if Bitcoin runs to 100K 110K these numbers don't exactly suddenly change. Okay, for this onchain data to suddenly start being very very different. You actually need a complete reversal. You need Bitcoin to get above 105 110K and stay there for a little bit. Just getting to 100K won't correct any of this pretty much. And of course, perhaps unsurprisingly, ETF flows have been negative as well. You know, obviously they're a large portion of the actual total inflows anyway. You could argue that maybe this was just the December tax loss harvesting thing. So onchain data from Glassnode, this was two weeks ago, okay? And we had the short-term coster basis at basically 102K. Active invested mean at like 88K. And I just want to show you how this has changed in the last two weeks. The short-term coster basis has come down. So not surprisingly as price is underneath this level now we're starting to starting to see the short-term coster basis come down. And all this looks like on the chart right is look the short-term coster basis which is we just saw that level like 99 almost 100K is lining up perfectly with the 50-week moving average. Realized price at the bottom is lining up perfectly with the 200-week moving average. And so we're trading right here right now sort of between this true mean and the short-term coster basis. But"

Realized price at the bottom is lining up perfectly with the 200-week moving average. And so we're trading right here right now sort of between this true mean and the short-term coster basis. But the short-term coster basis every week is just sort of trending down just like the 50-week moving averages. I think this is going to provide pretty brutal overhead support to be honest. I really think we test this level much more likely than we break this 81K level. But unless unless Bitcoin can break above and hold above 107K, this is just a lower high and a macro lower high at that and we probably should expect further downside. Onchain is saying, \"Look, things don't look great. I know we've seen a few green days in January so far. I know we've seen some real heavy compression in volatility in this kind of region here as well. But my base case is that we retest here, we come down lower. Now, everyone's going to be super bullish here and probably it's going to be hard to remain bearish when price gets there. But I'm going to try and stay pretty neutral. Unless Bitcoin breaks above 107K, holds there on, you know, daily time frame, weekly time frame. If it can do that, then I'm just going to completely change my bias. Yes, fine. Complete bull mode. But unless that happens, then my base case is that the middle of Q1, you know, we're probably going to see further downside action. However, as I've been saying for a long time, I've actually been relatively bullish in these areas for a trade because I think it's much more likely we hit 100K than than we break below this previous wick level, 81K. And now for some slightly more bullish pieces of news. Look, sentiment is absolutely dead, right? And when sentiment gets this dead, typically it's good. We saw here sentiment was dead. Like fear and greed was completely in the dead in the water. It worked out here. It worked out here, here, here, here, here. All these were great buying opportunities. Now, it didn't work every single time. These little like exclamation points and these red crosses are when just buying fear didn't work. And you can see that actually like when things are bad, when things are really in a bear market, it comes it can stay down for a very, very long time. So just because sentiment is bad right now, it doesn't mean it must immediately reverse. Just think back a month, everyone said sentiment is rubbish."

So just because sentiment is bad right now, it doesn't mean it must immediately reverse. Just think back a month, everyone said sentiment is rubbish. It's not going to get any better. It could only get better. You know, it got worse. Just because things are bad doesn't mean they necessarily need to immediately reverse. But it is worth having that kind of like thought process of okay, things are bad now. If I zoom out 6 months, 12 months, will I be happy or sad if I get things wrong here? For example, if I buy Bitcoin here, am I going to be brutally upset if it goes to 60K? Not really. I'm just going to be quite happy that it's gone to 60K and I'll buy some at 60K as well. And again, another thing that just says look, Bitcoin is good value here most likely. It doesn't mean it can't go lower. This is the Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. And if you don't know what the Sharpe ratio is, it just sort of like is a way of saying are the risk adjusted returns for this asset worth it. Because if you're getting bad returns and it's super risky, definitely not. But if you're getting good returns and it's super risky, then actually, you know, it probably is worth it. So what you can see is that every time the Sharpe ratio of Bitcoin has hit minus one, they've been absolutely incredible buying opportunities. Maybe it never hits these levels again. You know, maybe it does, but right now it's trading at a Sharpe ratio of about zero. Again, that's been a good time to buy Bitcoin in the past, but it hasn't mean that it can't go lower. You know, you could have bought it here, it went a bit lower. You could have bought it here, it went lower and it stayed lower. You could have bought it here, it went a bit lower. You could have bought it here, bang, caught the bottom. Could have bought it here, went lower for about a year. Not necessarily a bad time to buy Bitcoin overall. However, it often went lower. And just to sort of like highlight where we are right now, this is the funding heat map for all of crypto across the last 30 days. Taking on positions right now, especially in like Bitcoin, you can be paid to go long. You know, this is a minus 3 percent interest rate. So, just think about that. You get paid to"

Taking on positions right now, especially in like Bitcoin, you can be paid to go long. You know, this is a minus 3 percent interest rate. So, just think about that. You get paid to long Bitcoin. Bitcoin is trading like 90,000 dollars. I mean, imagine going back, you know, 4 years and thinking Bitcoin is going to 90K and you're going to get paid to long it. It's the equivalent of Bitcoin being, you know, 140 160K in four years and being paid to go long. Then just quickly guys, I want to tell you about Easy Bitcoin. This segment is sponsored by Easy Bitcoin. They're part of the Easy Group family and Easy Bitcoin operate a recurring purchase service for Bitcoin. The service functions through scheduled card payments at userdefined intervals. Upon processing payment, the company purchase Bitcoin and transfers it to a users specified address. The service operates in a non-custodial basis, meaning purchase Bitcoin is sent directly to the users's controlled wallet without being held on the platform. This means users can choose how much they want a DCA, how frequently they want a DCA, and it's never held by Easy Bitcoin. It's always held in the user's own wallet.

Cryptocurrency investments carry significant risks including total loss of capital. Always do your own research. Thank you so much to Easy Bitcoin for sponsoring this portion of the video. And we've obviously also got a bunch of macro catalysts. Arguably should be pushing the economy forward. Okay, so this is the PMI. You've probably seen the PMI 100 times. The blue line is the PMI. In these little red boxes, we've got quantitative tightening. So when the Federal Reserve is pulling out money from the economy, what you can see is that look, during times of QT, the PMI tends to contract. And actually that coincides pretty nicely with pullbacks in Total 3's market cap. This is market cap Total 3. Everything except Bitcoin, ETH, stable coins. When this is pulling back, when the PMI is pulling back, when QT is ongoing, we tend to see a pullback in this group of altcoins. It doesn't mean that when end to QT ends though, suddenly we just blast off. Actually, last time QT ended, it still took, you know, 440 days before price really broke above that level and and rallied on. Again though, you can see that when the PMI began to contract, Total 3"

Actually, last time QT ended, it still took, you know, 440 days before price really broke above that level and and rallied on. Again though, you can see that when the PMI began to contract, Total 3 began to pull back pretty much. Yes, it made one higher high, but you know, for the most part, this would have been a great place to sell, wouldn't it? And QT began. Yes, prices were already pulling back anyway. They'd already pulled back quite a lot to be honest, but during this contraction, we've just seen prices really sort of bleed out into that bear market low. We haven't seen the PMI expand yet. What could make the PMI expand? Well, one interesting leading indicator for the PMI is Chicago. This is Chicago's business barometer, which is Chicago's PMI relative to the PMI of the US. And you can see that with Chicago being the purple one, it tends to kind of like lead, right? And the reason Chicago tends to lead is because Chicago's data is released slightly earlier. And it generally signals direction because a lot of the sort of trade in the US kind of goes through Chicago. So they see things show up in sort of orders prior to the rest of the US. And obviously readings of sub 50 mean economic contraction. Companies are literally reporting worse data this month than they were in the previous month. We've got the next reading on January 5th, so you know on Monday and we can actually gleam a little bit of information from Chicago. And so Chicago actually had their latest reading on the 30th of December it was released still in contraction. They had a reading of 43.5. So they're still under 50, but they had a big jump, a 7 percentage point increase from the 38 low that they had last month. And this actually was a beating of expectations by seven. So they beat the expectations of the number by seven. And what you have seen in the past is that when Chicago beats expectations, so what the market thinks is going to hit in terms of its PMI number by three points or more, the ISM beats its forecast 70 percent of the time. The ISM expectations are 48.4 70 percent of the time. When Chicago beats by three or more, US national PMI also beats, right? So it wouldn't be surprising to see an upside surprise here. And of course, an upside surprise would mean that this PMI here gets above this 50 line and then maybe we can start to"

And of course, an upside surprise would mean that this PMI here gets above this 50 line and then maybe we can start to see economic expansion. My base case is not that this happens immediately. It takes a very very long time for these things to actually come to fruition and end up playing out. But Chicago can help us give a idea of whether or not the the US's national PMI is going to be turning around. And again, just this is what Bitcoin looks like against the PMI. Probably seen it 100 times, but when QT ends doesn't necessarily mean Bitcoin just necessarily rallies. When QT ends, again, it doesn't necessarily mean the PMI must immediately turn around. It is a real help, though. And actually, QT has now ended. I think the Federal Reserve added a little bit of money to their balance sheet over the last few weeks as well, you know, so this is actually going to be reversing soon, and we're going to start to see more money push into the economy. Liquidity is coming back again. It's just not something that necessarily gets shown in asset prices immediately, especially if this money isn't filtering its way down through to the people who are really driving, you know, asset prices, crypto prices especially upwards, who are obviously people who are not just investing passively in, you know, their 401ks. And guys, before I go, I just want to really quick tell you about today's sponsor, Ledger. Massive shout out to Ledger for sponsoring today's video. Thank you very much to them. If you haven't got a hardware wallet, guys, you need a hardware wallet if you're in crypto. Cannot go around holding all your tokens in some hot wallet just existing on your Chrome account. Get yourself a hardware wallet. Put your crypto on it. I mean, honestly, these are also great presents. I mean, we're kind of past Christmas now, but Ledger giving you 10 bucks of Bitcoin with any purchase. For me, I just get these ones here. The the S+ and the Nano X. These are the ones I use all the time. The Nano X is Bluetooth. Very, very convenient. The S+ is wired. Lots less convenient, but, you know, super cheap. For 40 bucks, you can basically secure your crypto. Guys, please, please, please don't have your crypto sitting just in a hot wallet. It must be secured offline. It's awesome to see markets are green. I think this year is going"

I just think it's not worth getting carried away, getting swept up with uber bullish sentiment and just having a clear idea of what you want to get out of the year because just buying things, holding them, and praying is obviously not the strategy. Guys, go check out this video here, which says my strategy for not holding a bunch of different tokens and and why I think that's the best strategy. And go check out this video here on this token that I think has the potential to be one of 2026's biggest plays. Go check it out here. Otherwise, thank you so much for watching. I shall see you in the next one."
