      "text": "All right. Are we live? Amazing. Guys, welcome back to a new live stream. Today we're all about the trenches. You see a CA here. There's several CAS that I want to drop today, but this is definitely something very interesting. So, you probably saw me call packs just the other the other week. So, I'm going to talk about this today. But before even getting started, if you're not looking at what I'm doing in the trenches, you're probably missing out. Look what happened here. In the last week, I called a 1,000x or to be precise, a 1,423x. What the hell? Like 19k entry. 2026 is going to be amazing. Like if this is just getting started and these are the type of calls that I'm doing, I've called a 100x, a 1,00 plus x, an 85x, and just a 50x the other day with 2016. So if you guys are following, you guys are going to print. So I want to hear from you down in the comments today. First of all, drop a like for the algorithm, drop a like for the uh banter fam. I'm going to basically tell you what I'm doing right now in the trenches, what I think is the hottest stuff. And also and also I'm going to share some things that in my opinion is going to explode. So first of all I've called PAX. I'm still extremely bullish on PAX. So let me get the POX chart first of all. 236K right now. I dropped the VIP group alert at 220K. It went to 800. So that was a clean 4x. Especially if you watch the banter live stream. Congrats because you still would have gotten a very good entry. But what I'm saying is that [clears throat] the the patchy penguins met is extremely hot right now. So we saw poly that went to 2 million PS went to 800k if in my opinion is going to go much higher because there's a lot of chaos supporting this in my opinion like the thesis is very strong because everybody's just talking about it and pang is the main one went to billions. So obviously in my opinion it has a lot of potential and I was thinking about something and I made this tweet earlier so let me grab it. Let me share it with you. So, there's a lot of characters into the Punchy Penguins universe, right? But a lot of them have not even been deployed. So, this one strikes to me because it's just gold. It's cool. It's called Peaches. It's extremely catchy. How is it possible that nobody ever launches? So, I tweeted this and a lot of people started immediately to to basically put deploys and I was like, \"Wow.\" Okay. Then I saw one that had migrations. The other ones didn't have migrations. I was like, \"All right, maybe this one is legit.\" So, I'm gonna be supporting this as like the official one just because it's a good wallet just because of that. And uh yeah, it seems like the first few KS are starting to buy. What's up, Lymph? I see you buying here. So, let's see. Let's see what happens. I mean, to me, it's extremely interesting and I appreciate my emotion. I didn't think that just me putting a CA like everybody would just like start aping it. I'm not launching it just full transparency but I support good teams and good launches. This looks good. So I mean I'm I would be happy to pay X. What are we thinking? Plex is also right here. I think we're bullish on this one. >> I have to say let me say we made a crazy amount of money with Bucks. >> Let me speak louder. I don't know if you can hear. We paid a penthouse in [ __ ] Colombia. >> Oh, yeah. You probably You probably saw that. You probably saw it. >> Do you know what? Um, I'm going to pay Dex. >> You're paying Dex? >> Yeah. Yeah. Ch. >> All right. Should we pay Dex? Should we pay Dex? Let us know. Should we pay Dex? Let us know. Should we pay Dex? >> Dex? >> I'm going to pay Dex now. >> You want to pay Dex, >> bro? It's super bullish. Come on. >> I mean, the chart is bullish. 30K. Let's see. We could pay Dex. By the way, look at the penthouse. Did I Did I show it? [laughter] >> We We should probably show this penthouse. >> All right. So, first of all, thanks Pax for this >> cuz we're printing like crazy. You saw the calls. Pox the Punchy Penguins Meta is bullish. >> Plex payex."

Pox the Punchy Penguins Meta is bullish. >> Plex payex. All right. >> Payex. Okay. We're payex. We're payex by. I mean, that's up to you, bro. Like, no financial advice. Minkcoins are extremely risky. In today's live streams, I'm we're going to talk about some meme coins and uh and see what happens, you know, like obviously I bought some of this full disclosure and we like it. So, Plex and I decided to pay Dex on this one despite the fact that we did not launch it. All right, it's 30K right now. Um I found it and bought it and brought it to the VIP group at something like 10K, something like that. Let's see. Let's see. 30K looks bullish. Let's pay Dex should update very very soon. So, let's see. Yeah, talking about the other calls that I made, you probably saw a blue whale went to like a parabolic one like 115x. Um, let me see also here on my Telegram. By the way, if you're not on my free Telegram, just please go there. Do yourself a favor, bro? Like, it's it's free. All right, it's just free information. You would have seen some calls, not as early as in my private group that you can also find. It's linked down description. But bro, what's a CA? Um, I can't put it in the live chat because it's just a string of character, but I'm just going to show you here from the Axiom. So, it's this one that also Lynford bought. Lynfor is a public K, so he's B his dog. So, if you follow him, you're going to see it. But anyway, is the right CA is this one that starts with GVJ2T2. Okay, this is the one that I bought and this is um the one that we're paying Dex right now. Is Dex paid? >> We're paying now, guys. We're paying now. So, here's the alpha. We're paying Dex. All right. So, this is the one. Anyway, I was talking about these calls. Yeah. Just insane. Like, what other Kos what other streamers? All the other streamers are just like freaking farmers that just want copy traders. I don't care. I made a buy on this and I'm just leaving it. Literally, I'm hands here. My wallet is even docked. I'm not selling. So, whatever. And everybody has my main wallet. Lee, I posted the CA here. Yeah, you posted it, but I don't think we can see it because I think that YouTube like sees CA as spams for most of the time. Um, but anyway, it's this one, guys. It's this one. Obviously, I'm not telling you to buy. Do your own research. I'm just a trencher. I'm just a DJ trader. I trade. I buy and sell meme coins. You decide. Check it out if you like it. If you like the narrative, I'm just telling you that we are paying decks. Okay, this is the C8. It's right here on the screen. Um, yeah, I mean these calls have been crazy, but I don't want to talk too much about all things of the past. Whatever. There's always going to be a next call that is just going to go parabolic. So, I'm all for just like looking for the next things. Obviously, everybody's just bullish on bags right now. I think that the meta or bags is not going to last too long in my opinion. It's just like too bearish. Who's selling freaking Jeets? We're legit paying decks. Anyways, the bags met in my opinion is not going to last too long about it. Everybody's been trading back coins. I fed a lot of runners to be honest, but there's been quite a few of them. Okay, we have the CA right there. We got it. So, the alpha is that we're paying. Is it paid yet?"

I'm just waiting for the link. I also saw that some scammers are trying to launch other tokens. I mean, this is the one that I'm supporting and the tweet is mine. So, browse. Like if you just click on here, you see that I tweeted. [clears throat] So given that my tweet is my own copyright, I decide which CA is the legit one and it's this one. All right. Paidex. God damn it. Flex. Paidex. [ __ ] sake. >> All right, we have the community. I'm joining. Do we have the CA in the community? So, I first of all, I don't know who created the community, but who created the community? Please um just put the CA in the community so people know that it's the right one. And by the way, I literally put how this is how the MCO space is [ __ ] Literally, I even put on my own tweet that the legit CA of the legit deploy is this one. And people still try to launch new ones. What's wrong with people? What the [ __ ] We were having difficulties at paying dice, but we're paying it right now. You guys have the confirmation of my own tweets. I mean, isn't it crazy that people would just grab my tweet and say, \"Hey, this is another CA.\" When literally on my own tweet, I put the CA. What's wrong with people? How do I get in the community? Uh, the community, I don't think I can put the link. I can try. I hope that they listen to me and they put the Okay, I'm just going to make a post right now in the community. I work for my own bags. Okay, here's confirmed. There's literally the community. There's the CA right here. Okay, so let me put a tweet. This is the real CA. And I put a picture. All right, I'm going to post in the community. Okay, so how do you get in the community? Um, yeah, just go on my tweet on my the latest tweet that I put and I put this is the real CA and if you click on here, you're going to be able to get in the community. You can see right here All right, we're paying ducks. Don't worry. So, this is the real CA. So, I want to make one thing clear. Make bag working great again. If we want to send it, here's what you got to do. you saw my tweet, the link in the community is there. You click on there, you join a community, you you bring up content. There's like plenty of cont like a public um character. So, there's going to be like a lot of um of images that you can just like Google. The character is named Peaches. Here's the CA. Work for your bags. That's it. Then you can send it. Yeah, the guys were just like gathering like all the links for the decks. Finally [ __ ] going to pay. Let's send it. And [ __ ] if you launched a thing trying to vamp my It's not my coin, but it's my tweet. So, I have a saying. Gez. So, let's send Pox Poly. I'm not positioned, so who cares? No, I'm joking. If you get like Polly by Poly, but right now my positions are this pox and peaches. Pox is like the I want to call it the alpha play."

If you get like Polly by Poly, but right now my positions are this pox and peaches. Pox is like the I want to call it the alpha play. I mean, the alpha play would be the Pip Penguins token. This PX would be the main derivative and the later derivative would be peaches. But at the end of the day, the risk-to-reward of getting something that is like 28k market cap is like really really good as soon as Dex is paid. Let's see if we can bond it. Trade 11 says, \"Give me a dip.\" I mean, it's cheap enough, bro. I really like the tweet. Great. All right, let's read some comments. LFG, what's up, Will? Let's go. Let's go. Also, just a reminder, I also have a personal YouTube channel. It's Sepil. It's linked down in the description. So, just follow me on there. Uh, I have a free Telegram channel, a private VIP group. All the good stuff is there. And also, I want to remind you, currently, I'm using Axum because obviously it's like the OG trading bot that I've been using. I've been playing with Padre. Right now, Trojan has recently launched um a new trading bot. And uh if you register with my link, actually, you get $50 off. It's linked down in the description. You can just try to sign up, see how you like it. To be completely honest, right now there's like new trading bots almost every damn day. There's like a lot to look forward to. Like the trenches are like really getting heated up. But check out Trojan. You got like $50 for free. So, I mean, what not to like? The chart is picking traction. >> Is being paid now. >> That thing is being paid now. That's probably why the chart is getting traction. I'm not going to sell anything before the migration. People have my wallet. You can check. Banter Royale. Banter Royale is not today, brother. But we love Bant Royale. Shout out to all the Banter family. Drop a like. Drop a like for the alpha. Drop a like for for live streams and for the trenches being revived again. How is everybody feeling about the trenches? Finally, the market seems to be back. That's paid. Oh, finally that's paid. Is it showing? >> Yep. >> I'm all B. It's showing. >> Okay, it's showing. That's is paid. Send it. >> Go, go, go. Let's go. LFG. Brett Gold. Why? Why, bro? What should we buy that? Also, if anybody has like good like CAS and you want to drop them in the comments, feel free. I'm all yours. The CA, we already shown the CA of this one and the deck has just been paid. Final. Oh, the banner is pretty cool. The banner is pretty cool. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to do a lot of bag working. So, let's go in the com. Okay, I think I downloaded some other pictures. I can put 90 members. Join the freaking community, guys. There's like 300 viewers right now. 360 viewers. So, you can at least the minimum you can do is just like join the com. Dex is paid. Dex is paid for peaches. Send it. Send the peaches. X is paid finally. It's about time that you paid X. And you see I'm literally the K streamer here. Whatever. And I'm the first one to work for my bag. So if you're not working for your bags, you literally have no excuses. I really want to make this like clear to you. Like everybody should work for their bags. Volume is crazy. Like there's like so many tickers that have been launched, but now at least we have like the confirmation of which one is real and all the other ones are fake. It's my freaking tweet.

I mean, I literally call this live at 10K. If you're not in, if you're sidelined, I mean, I don't know what to tell you guys. So, my opinion is looking really, really good. Pump it. I'm trying my best to work for my bags. Put a post in the community. I ain't going I ain't buying an alltime high. You probably texted this when it was like 15k market cap, my friend. [laughter] I I love that just people are like, \"Bro, I'm not going to top blast at 15k market cap. I want a 5k entry because >> I pay Dex.\" >> Plex paid Dex. Literally, thank you, Plex. Thank you so much. Thank you, Plex. Can everybody say in the chat, \"Thank you, Plex, for paying Dex.\" Thank you. You just rocked me to zero. It's 42K market cap. I don't know what you're talking about, bro. Like, people are crazy. You just run me to zero. Literally all time high. What are the chances that this bull run is over? Uh, slim to none. Like, the trenches are just heating up. Why would the bull market be over? Like, it doesn't make any freaking sense. Just doesn't make sense. Why would the bull market be over? Like, why? No sense. I will share this on my official Hispanic community social media accounts. Much love. 50 boos, sir. Who paid? Did somebody pay boost? Really? No, I don't know. >> No, not yet. >> Not yet. Right. Wait, let me put a CA. 95 94% bond it. >> We're going to bond it. We're going to bond it. >> I mean, if we go to like 100k or something, I'm happy to pay boost myself. Why not? I love this. Thank you, fam. Appreciate you all. Dash, we talking about privacy coins today. I don't know. I mean, I don't think like I want to talk about privacy coins today because the trenches are just very very hot. Like, I don't think there's any like point in talking about something in the privacy meta. I mean, everything's been around bags this week. It's been multiple runners. Um, right now, to be completely fair, like I don't think that there's going to be like a massive massive runup of um of bags being. that just like it happened, but it's not something that is just going to last forever. LFG paid X tax has been paid already. What are you talking about? Oh, I also I want to remind you of something, guys. Should I drop another post in the meantime? Oh, Crypto Emperor. Shout out to her. She's posting packs like crazy. I also want to remind you that there is a spaces on Monday talking about packs. Obviously, this is not about pictures, but I just want to show you that like the entire math is extremely hot right now. So, there's going to be this live stream, these uh spaces, sorry. I'm going to be joined by Crypto Empress and Finance Freeman. Shout out to the guys. Great figures in the space. You should give them a follow. We're going to do a spaces about packs. You don't want to miss it. You don't want to miss it. It's going to be on Monday at 1 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. I'm going to be there. All right. All right. Should I put another post?

Also, if you have other CAS, other bullish stuff, let me know. This week, I've been I've been talking about the 20, for instance, I've been talking about the 2016 meta forever. Uh, I bought the OG one. I made a few X's, then there was a new deploy 55X. So, I think that there's going to be a lot of new tickers that are going to be that are going to be pushed into this sort of meta like like 2016 is everywhere. like you're probably seeing um a lot of memes on Instagram, on Tik Tok or whatever. So, if you want alpha, just go on Tik Tok. Tik Tok is the best place to get alpha these days. Here's the te thesis. Put another post on Telegram. Dex is paid bonded. I'm going to put a community on my Telegram group as well. Somebody has DM me that he's going to pay boost. Okay, thank you. Okay, do I have a community link to put here on my Telegram? Join the com and make back working great again. bullish. If I see anything other anything else that is bullish, I'm also going to share it. Also, remember, sign up on Trojan $50 for free. What are you doing? I'm also playing around with it. Obviously, majority of my trades are still on maximum padre, but um I like it. I mean, it's pretty much the same. It seems faster. And another thing of Trojan is that they have four 45% cash back. 45. Yeah. So it's probably the best one out there. I think P's 35, Axim is something like 30. So yeah, 45% is the best one in the game. So that's gives them a competitive edge. Let's see how it develops over time. Oh, and also if you're doing pers, I also have a link for Bitfunded. That is what I'm using to get funded. I'm almost almost past challenge level two and then money. Check it out. All the links all the links are down in the description as always. Okay, let's see the com. You know what? I miss the days of like one year ago when everybody would just join um a community and just like bag work on there and it was not just about oh what K bought this did Marcel buy oh when gay candle like now it's it's all about that or in the last few days it's been oh has this guy claiming fees on bags bro like we need to make bag working great again this is how the trenches are seriously going to heal guys are back working.

I still have a moon bag of 2016. Let me bring the chart, bro. What What market cap did I call it? Plex >> 50k >> 80 >> 80. >> Yeah, something like that. >> Wait, let me let me grab the scorec card. 70k 72K. So, to all the people that are like, \"Cut, bro. You didn't call it.\" Well, I did. Just look at that. The scorecards don't lie. Is it going to go higher? I'm not sure. Like I wouldn't recommend somebody to buy something when it's 3 million in market cap. But you know, probably when I drop the signals in my VP Group, yes, Bax is going to give us the next 1,00x. 10,00x is a little too much for something that was already 200k market cap, but I definitely think that it has the potential to go to multi-millions. And also the I mean the the dad the team they're very active. So if I go on packs they're super active. Oh they even retweeted. See this is what it means to work for your bags. >> That's my >> look like like they're super super active. several KOs that are posting about it. This is what you need to look for, you know, for for teams when they start bull posting. They keep at it. I love that. It's just very memeable. Imagine if next week features goes to like I don't know 500k to 1 million. They start collabing with packs or something like that. Would be funny. I love this meta. I'm also doing a giveaway for for pack. So, if you're not following my ex, please follow me. Uh I'm not sure how much money we're giving away if you speak with the team, but we're doing a giveaway. So, follow me on X, follow me on TG, my personal YouTube channel. Drop a like. If you're printing, if you watch the live streams, you print. All right. So, Plex, why don't you come here and talk about how bullish you are on pictures? I mean, you paid, Dex. The mic is yours. >> Yeah, my like Let me [clears throat] get the chair, bro. Let me get a chair. So, as you said, bro, on the tweet, like, Pax Pax went crazy. >> Yeah, I mean, we saw the chart of Pax. >> Polly went crazy. Peaches has to go crazy. I mean the moment you did that tweet everyone started but that CA is the only one that's actually legit the one that we are talking about. So I really think we have to we're going to migrate now.

I feel like ultimately these kind of coins need a website but it's really not. >> Yeah. Not at the start obviously. Yeah. Let's let's wait. Maybe they're waiting to migrate I think. >> Yeah. And also people are ready to pay boosts after migration. Plus the man is here. Oh, since you're here why don't you also talk about Riv because I'm hearing the launch is near. >> Yeah. So >> as you know Riv is an official sponsor of these live streams. It has been for the last months >> and every live stream here is always disclosed. So obviously Riv is one of the sponsor. So yeah go ahead. >> So what is Riv doing? Riv is building an ecosystem. It started building a wallet and now we're launching we're going to launch the coin a coin that is an assetbacked coin.

You see, every month we're doing giveaways. Every month we are doing $1,000 giveaway split between five people. This was a contest that we did on the clipping of this live streams. So you just get this live stream, you clip them, you post them. The post that get more engagement or are nicer and um perform the best are going to win a prize. First prize $500, second prize $300, and third prize $200. the team is going to launch very soon. Uh obviously because the market seems to to to be coming back, right? So makes sense that that we're going to that the team is going to launch. As you know, I've been on board in the team for more than two years and uh what can I say? The team is built by serious people that have been in the crypto space for a lot of time and have been in traditional finance for a lot of time. So, I'm incredibly bullish and um you should for sure follow Riv, join the communities. I mean, you don't need to do anything else if you want to have an early CA and if you want to be eligible. >> Yes. >> For an airdrop. So, don't miss out guys. Don't miss out this. >> Thank you, bro.

Thank you. Gracias. How do I get packs? Uh, basically you just get on um a trading bot. I have Trojan linked down below. We're almost close to 100K by the way. If we go to 100K, I'm going to pay for the boost as we said. How do I get packs? Uh, as I said, just that's what you got to do. Like you you jump on a training bot. I have Trojan link down description. Um, or you can use Axium. You can use P. Choose the one that you like the most. Obviously, Axim is one of the OGs of like trenching. Uh, Trojan is the new kid on the block. It's looking extremely good. That's why I'm trying to like move to it because I think it's faster. Axium is like my favorite interface, but it's slow compared to other training bots. So, I'm trying to move to Trojan, but it takes time. It takes a few days to just get adjusted to a new thing. Um, and yeah, like you have the CA, right? You just go on that screener if you need it, but you can just type just type here like go like you go on the search bar. You type p is this one. So you go on pox and uh obviously you found your sana wallet. And by the way, by by the way, full disclosure, I'm using a demo account because I don't pe I don't want people to just like copy trade me. So that's why I don't use my axim right here on the screen. That's just just full disclosure. But anyway, you you just type Pax and then you found your Salana wallet and then you buy I don't know one Salana. Bang. Okay, so Pax is here. Peach is here as well.
