If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and also check out my website at bjaminc.com. Let's go ahead and jump in. So, Palladium has now broken through 2000. We talked about a month or month and a half ago or so about this pattern right here. This sort of like this short-term double top on a lower time frame having been somewhat of a familiar pattern. And we basically saw that same type of move on gold um back in 2025, right? And basically what happened, what we talked about in the video was that all right, when you get these sort of these shorter term double tops, it likely goes down for a little bit and then slowly works its way back up. Okay, you might get one more scare, but then it should continue higher. So, I think that's where we are with Platium now, right? Like we we we sort of worked through this. We had our our little double top area. We consolidated. Now, we've moved on to new highs. Yes, there could be another pullback uh if it were to follow what gold did. But ultimately, I think the the view on palladium still remains uh macro bullish. You know, we first talked about palladium on this channel back when it was around,080,090 and you can see it's already basically doubled in a relatively short period of time. You're talking about like since September of 2025. I know a lot of people want me to talk more about crypto. But again, don't marry an asset class. You go where the bull market is. Don't try to man manufacture one where it's not. And if you look at the recent move by Bitcoin against palladium since September anyways when we made that video um even if you take it from September Bitcoin is now down about 55% against palladium you know and I mean this is one of those things where I've seen these charts a million times in the past um where you basically have a structure that looks like this. you consolidate, you go up into this massive distribution, you come back down. Usually what happens is you might get a little bit of reprieve for a little while, but then eventually it breaks down. And that's how I think this is ultimately going to play out because a lot of times in midterm years, Bitcoin becomes devalued against many other things like against gold, against silver, um, and against things potentially like palladium. In fact, if you look at the year-to-ate ROI of Palladium in 2026, it looks kind of crazy, right? It looks kind of crazy. It's already gone up 20%. But then I'm like, well, is it what did it do in 2022? And I'm like, oh, it did the same thing, right? like it it went up, consolidated, and then went up again, consolidated, and then had another spike in uh late February or so, and then it kind of cooled off as the year went on. So, when I think about, you know, like where we are right now and and where Platium is, I continue to remain bullish on it for now. I do think obviously there's a risk of a pullback in in metals and whatnot, but the reality is and I and and you know, let me know if you've heard this one. Um, yes, everyone knows there will be a pullback in metals. There's a lot of people that basically spent all of last year buying illquid altcoins that are out there just beating the drum saying that, hey, sell the metals, sell the metals. But again, like they were never here to encourage buying them in the first place. So yes, like it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that metals are getting kind of heated. But that also means that if you are going to sell a metal, you have to figure out what you're going to go buy buy with it. And and I don't really think crypto is the answer right now. I don't I think a lot of people are sort of making the same mistakes as before. They thought there was going to be a rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins. Now they think there's going to be a rotation from metals to crypto whenever metals top out. But that's usually not what happens. usually after metals go parabolic um risk assets then drop whenever metals top out. So I I wouldn't assume that that's what's going to take place. What I what I've been viewing as we've talked about this before this path by palladium the sort of the first target always was to sort of sweep the initial highs over here right and then the next one was to come up to the next wicks which we did. And then the next one was the next highs and we went above that. Um, and ultimately, I mean, I think what I've been sort of eyeing is this level up here. Now, will we make it there on this run? I don't really know, but that's kind of the main target that I was [snorts] looking at back then. And it could be like a range like it could be, you know, somewhere a little over um uh 2150 up to 2350, something like that. If if we can just keep this party going a little bit longer, seems like a likely outcome. Um but ultimately, you know, a lot of these metals when you look at them, like palladium is still well below the prior all-time highs. Um obviously things like silver have, you know, surpassed them long ago. Oh, you can see silver easily surpassed it. Gold surpassed it a while back. Um, and platinum also recently did. And so I guess like, you know, I I I remain bullish on palladium. And I I mean, I wonder, you know, if it can make it up to this zone, that still doesn't even mean it's the top. I mean there there does exist a scenario where it it continues to rally for a while um before ultimately stalling out and and and going back down. I will say like pilad palladium is riskier uh than some of the other metals like it it can you know it can get these nice spikes and then just kind of like drop right back down. So, I don't want you to get complacent with it because it's not like it's not like it has to go back to the prior all-time highs like the other metals. Like you can see there is sort of like a triple spike over there maybe similar to this, you know, and then it eventually came back down. It had a spike uh but then it dropped and then and then ultimately it went higher. Um, and if you kind of if you look back then at at where it ultimately rallied to, it looks like it made it near the 0.5 in in that case. If you look at it over here, you can see it's approaching that and that level would be about, you know, that that 2150 level. It's getting getting closer to at the end of the day. Um, you know, we're in a different time period than this over here as well. Like this was occurring sort of just after the dot crash, this area over here. and and right now and also by the way in in this area over here it was after gold had topped out a couple you know a few years before um uh well no I guess gold had not topped out a few years before this one it had topped out a few years um before some of the others let's just pull it up really quick I can't remember which one it was I know gold topped in 2011 uh but it also had some of these other tops where palladium sometimes kind of did something different. Um, so in this case, gold found a low around the same time that palladium found a high, right? And so they they're not really on the same on the same move. This is what I meant, right? There was a a shortterm high by gold. It dropped a little bit, but then it continued to run. And when that happened, palladium dropped more. You see that? Um and when gold dropped in the '08, palladium dropped uh quite a lot. So I I palladium is riskier than gold. It's riskier than silver. Yes, it can go up. It can also just as easily go back down. So I don't I don't think people should be complacent with it. I mean, I think with things like gold, it's been easy to be complacent with it. Palladium to me still looks structurally bullish. It does. Um absolutely. It looks like so many of the patterns we followed, but longer term, it's not it's not as good of a long-term investment as something like gold. Um, just because whenever corrections do happen, it tends to get hit uh quite a bit harder. With that said, I mean, from the lows, it's already up, you know, like 141%. If it can just rally up to the the levels that we've talked about up there from the low, that would be about a almost a 200% rally. So, for now, I still remain structurally bullish on uh palladium. If if we start to see any signs of worry, you know, I'll you hopefully I can at least um talk about that. But it doesn't really seem like we're see that we're seeing that at the current time. And in fact, one of the things I mentioned to you guys after this drop here was that it would likely take a few weeks for us to then go back and put in a new high. And now we have, right? And you can see it took from December 24th about a month later, right? It took about a month and ultim ultimately reclaim those highs. As I said back over here, usually when you get a drop that quick, it takes it can take a few weeks to to repair it and and it has taken a while. So for now, hopefully play can continue to go higher. Congrats to anyone who took the trade uh when I did back over here at around 1,080,90. It's been a really great trade. Um, and it just kind of goes to show you why diversifying is not the worst idea.
