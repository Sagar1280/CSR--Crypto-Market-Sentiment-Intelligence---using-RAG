  "transcript": "But I see a big large use case for Bitcoin and I still do today. >> Black Rock is manipulating the Bitcoin price and I can prove it. I'll show you. >> And so u you know this is one thing that I get excited about. I >> we understand that Larry Frink is the CEO of BlackRock also now in charge of the World Economic Forum. >> Larry Frink is now running I believe the World Economic Forum. [music] He's acting chairman and uh in addition to saying that everything Yeah. In addition to saying that everything will be tokenized, he's uh [music] said that everything will soon be uh on the same universal uh digital ledger or [music] database. >> And let's remember how Larry Frink's opinion totally changed over the years. He lied to you in [music] public at first so he could buy cheap. >> Is it true that you're building out a cryptocurrency capability? Uh, no. >> Don't your clients want crypto exposure? >> No, I don't believe any client has sought out crypto exposure. >> Really? >> Yes. >> Is it time yet for Black Rockck to either trade in digital assets or digital virtual currencies if you prefer or to create a product for your client? >> We're not hearing we're not hearing any demand from any of our clients. >> It's not an institutional thing. >> It's far from that. As I said, it's much more of a speculative platform for Asia and it's heavily used for money laundering. >> Just yesterday, we launched the [music] EyesShares Bitcoin ETF. I'm very bullish um on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. [music] I was saying, did that surprise you? >> That surprised me how much that As you know, I was a skeptic. [music] >> Yes, I you know, I was a proud skeptic. I my opinion 5 years ago was wrong. Here's my opinion [music] today. this is what I believe in today. I believe Bitcoin is legitimate if everybody adopted that [music] conversation that you know it would be 500,000 600,000 700,000 for Bitcoin. >> Which brings us to today. Larry Frink is in control. He's a major player in crypto. The most successful ETF in history was his ETF. >> At the end of every month, we get these pukes. Hedge fund manager and investing expert Mark Yusco on his podcast Digital Currents explains and by the way this first part not illegal big money whales play whale games and they do this out in the open. Mark Yusco lets the rest of us in exactly what they do which and you can see this in the chart. Wales buy spot Bitcoin, meaning real Bitcoin, but then short Bitcoin futures, which gets settled by the end of the month. That's why when Bitcoin starts to climb up, it suddenly pukes back down at the end of the month. Mark Yusco explains what's happening to Bitcoin and what that means for the Bitcoin price at the end of this month. Let's watch this clip. Listen, and then I'll react. The other thing is this issue of of what we just saw on Monday, right? Is at the end of every month we get these pukes. Well, why are we getting these pukes? Well, it's because people are short the future and long the spot. Okay? And over the course of the month, the futures price drops to the spot price. Well, then they have to unwind that at the end of the month and start over on the first day of the new month. So technically Friday was the first day, but no one was working. So really it rolled over to Monday the 5th and so bang, lots of new demand and and we get this this big runup. But then what happens? Well, then they got to put the short on. So the short futures come on and and what you saw was the futures activity, the CME activity collapsed at the end of the year because everybody had made all their money. And so if that spoofing keeps happening, right, there's this artificial cap put on prices because, you know, the people who are quote unquote buying all the ETF are shorting the future against it to arbitrage the spread. That's not net new money. What we need is net new money. and Morgan Stanley and Vanguard and others could could provide that if if people actually allocate you know the two three 4% like Bank of America said you think about this Bank of America said the average client should have 4% in in Bitcoin. >> I like it. >> I mean this is a bank that said no way no how over my dead body kind of language two years ago now saying 4%. So net new money's coming, but I think the problem is in the short run, is that enough upward thrust to get over the downward um cap from the big dog shorting it? I don't think so in the short run. >> Yeah. Now that that that makes all the sense in the world, Mark, and it points to what may happen at the end of this month where you're seeing a bunch of contracts circling around that 100K mark as we got very close. So, you know, expect some movement um right uh right right to close the month and start start in February. So Mark is saying that it's no secret that the Bitcoin price is grinding its way upwards to 100K by the end of this month. Even though we puked back down on the first Monday that people were in the office because it was coming off the holiday of this month. It's no secret that from the puke of the last month, we're grinding into 100K. And why is that? Because that's where the leverage is pointing to. Now, something that could be a catalyst that could bring new money into the system is the Clarity Act, the market structure bill. For an update on where we are with that bill, I would encourage you to check out this video here. Crypto is absolutely done. Major legislation fail in Congress and then an update in our last video. But the news today is this. The White House, meaning Trump, David Sachs, is considering pulling its support for the crypto market structure bill entirely if Coinbase does not come back to the table with a yield agreement that satisfies the banks and gets everyone to a deal, a source close to the Trump administration tells me. meaning Trump is threatening to tank his support for the crypto market structure bill entirely if Coinbase does not come back to the table. The White House is said to be furious with Coinbase's unilateral action on Wednesday when they pulled out, which apparently was not notified in advance. They did not tell David Sax in advance, calling it a rugpull against the White House and the rest of the industry. The White House does not believe that one company speaks for the entire industry. This is the president's bill at the end of the day, not Brian Armstrong's in a direct quote. So, we of course are waiting for that net new money. Do not be fooled if the price suddenly looking bullish again than pukes just like do not be fooled if a lot of those shorts get liquidated and push the price higher. Nobody knows what the Bitcoin price will do in the short term, but we do know that traders affect price short-term, fundamentals affect price long-term. And in this exclusive clip on the Glen Beck Show with Whitney Webb, Whitney Webb warns that digital IDs and tokenization is paving the way for total control. Larry Frink is in charge of this. Black Rockck and Larry Frink's manipulation continues. And while the Clarity Act may not pass in the short term, make no mistake about it, Larry thinks Black Rockck is heavily accumulating Ethereum. This was last year, but Ethereum ETFs going parabolic with 80% flowing into BlackRock. And as of just a few days ago, Ethereum spot ETFs achieve stunning 164.3 million fourthday inflow surge as Black Rockck dominates. There's two major cryptos Black Rockck is accumulating. It's Bitcoin and it's Ethereum. They do not they have not applied for a Solana spot ETF. And keep that in mind as Whitney Webb issues her warning. >> How do we um well wait before I get there, let let me go back to digital ID, tie this into a digital currency because this is the this is the the highway system for that, isn't it? Sure. Yeah. Well, um, Larry Fank is now running, I believe, the World Economic Forum. He's acting chairman. [music] And, uh, in addition to saying that everything Yeah. In addition to saying that everything will be tokenized, he's, uh, said that everything will soon be, uh, on the [music] same universal uh, digital ledger or database. Um, and that everything on that database will have a unique identifier number. So for you as an individual, your identifier number uh will presumably be your digital ID or directly linked to that. But everything will have a digital ID. Uh the tokenization agenda in particular seeks to tokenize uh not just you know assets that we traditionally think of um like real estate [music] for example or or gold or you know physical assets as well as digital >> assets like Bitcoin. uh there's a a major effort [music] uh connected with people like like Fank and also people like Mark Carney who's now uh prime minister of of Canada to tokenize uh the the natural world and transform [music] it into financial assets and there was an attempt to do this to an extent under the Biden administration I believe through this the department of interior uh with natural [music] asset corporations but that has not gone away uh and there are groups um for example uh one of the creators [music] of the ETF F uh model originally uh which Black Rockck now now owns Eyesshares. His name is Peter Kz I think is how you pronounce it. He's trying to turn [music] um the Amazon rainforest uh into a a digital commodity [music] uh sort of similar to bear uh Bitcoin in terms of like the the scarcity [music] uh idea that you know each hectare of the Amazon rainforest would represent um you know a token and then and then financialize it that way and then each hectare would then be have its unique identifier right on on the on the blockchain >> and and would be you know harvested uh by surveillance drones and all sorts of stuff. So even our most like natural the places we conceptualize as the most natural places on earth. These people want to come and [music] play surveillance technology and you know tokenize it and put it on a blockchain and use it to [music] um you know I would argue in the case particularly of natural asset >> [music] >> uh corporations and the group behind it the intrinsic exchange group um they just want to open up a huge new [music] asset class. They call it nature's opportunity so that they can continue engaging in the same type of uh bad behavior that for example bought us brought us the 2008 financial crisis u by you know uh quintupling basically uh the amount of assets currently [music] in play. >> This is what we're fighting against. This is why I stand with Coinbase on the Clarity Act. Who is fighting? Who's saying the Clarity Act as they're trying to push it now is too permissioned for the banks? It doesn't give a chance at life for decentralized finance. This is not what crypto is about the current draft. Either way, the more permissioned, the more centralized and controlled the world gets, the more Bitcoin, the more Ethereum, maybe the more Cardano or Solana or these decentralized layer 1 protocols, the more you want to own. I believe as this story continues, I will keep you updated. Like always, see you tomorrow.",
