The \neconomy itself has had 10 straight months   of contraction. This shouldn't be possible \nunless there's two economies, one shrinking,   one exploding. And if you can understand which one \nBitcoin follows, you'll see why this setup looks   like 2016 and 2020. Let's go. This video is for \ninformation and entertainment only. It reflects   my personal opinions and is not financial advice. \nCheck the description for more information. Always   do your own research. This episode is supported \nby Uphold. You'll hear more from them later in the   episode. Hey guys, I'm Alessandro. Welcome back to \nthe show. To fully understand this relationship,   we first need to understand what the indicator \nis. This indicator is copper. It's called Dr.   Copper because it tends to diagnose the \neconomy before official data sees it. Why   is this? Copper goes into everything: buildings, \ncars, phones, wiring. When factories order copper,   they're ordering months before products \nactually ship. So copper moves first   and data confirms it later. There's a 0.91 \ncorrelation with manufacturing output when   copper leads by one month. It's nigh on perfect. \nOne would be perfectly correlated. In late 2007,   copper rolled over while stocks kept running. \nThe crash came a few months later. In 2020,   copper bottomed while everything else panic sold. \nRecovery followed. It's not magic. It's just   seeing demand before any surveys catch up. So, \nwhere are we now? Copper just hit all-time highs,   had its best year since 2009, up over 42%. But \nthe US manufacturing PMI is in contraction:   47.9. 10 straight months of contraction, including \njust recently in December. 85% of US manufacturing   GDP was shrinking in December. Now, globally, it's \nbeen barely above the expansion line. China is a   tenth of a point from contraction. This doesn't \nreally make any sense. When copper breaks to new   highs, usually the PMI should be screaming higher. \nInstead, we've got copper screaming growth, while   the economic data says the opposite. Now, one of \nthem is wrong. Or maybe something fundamental has   changed. Copper is no longer just responding \nto traditional manufacturing demand. There's   a new demand driver that didn't exist three years \nago. Obviously, this driver is AI. Just last week,   S&P Global dropped a report called Copper in \nthe Age of AI. And the headline was demand is   going from 28 million metric tons to 42 million \nby 2040. That's 50% more copper needed in 15   years. And the thing is that there just isn't \nenough. The traditional economy—construction,   appliances, cars—they still take a big chunk of \nthe copper demand. But this transition, EVs use   3x more copper than gas cars. Electric buses use \n10 to 15 times more copper. AI and data centers,   this one came out of nowhere really, but a \nsingle hyperscale data center uses 50,000   tons of copper. And it's not just the servers; \nit's the grids used to upgrade them, power them,   etc. Defense as well is a massive consumer of \ncopper. Global military spending could double   by 2040. Trump just added $500 billion to the \nUS military spend. So again, higher demand for   copper there. It's a very copper-heavy industry \nand three years ago AI wasn't even on the table.   It wasn't even on the radar of copper demand \nand now it's one of the key drivers. Obviously,   this is creating a supply problem. Supply can't \nkeep up. Copper production should peak in 2030   and then it's going to start declining. This is \nbecause ore grades are falling. So, the thing   that's actually pulled out of the ground, the \nquality, how much copper you get out of it, is   getting less over time. You need about 2.5 times \nmore rock out of the ground to get the same copper   you used to get 100 years ago. And new mines take \nabout 17 years from being discovered to producing   copper. So even if prices double tomorrow, \nnew supply can't arrive, even with enormous   investments in the infrastructure to actually \nmine the material. S&P Global's projection of   10 million metric tons by 2040 is a 25% deficit \nto demand. 25% is missing. They can't service it   based upon that particular report. But what does \nany of this have to do with Bitcoin? There's a   ratio macro traders watch and it's the copper to \ngold ratio. Copper divided by gold. Copper signals   growth. Gold signals fear. When copper outperforms \ngold, it's risk on. When gold outperforms copper,   it's risk off. It's a tried and tested formula \nthat has worked for years. And here's why it   matters. The last three times this ratio bottomed \nand turned were 2013, 2017, and 2021. All Bitcoin   cycle peaks came after this point. And right \nnow, the ratio looks like it's in a bottoming   formation. And what you can see is Bitcoin in \ngold and then copper over gold in blue. And what   you can see is that typically when you see these \ngreen arrows at the bottom, they correspond to a   move in Bitcoin and a corresponding move in the \nratio between copper and gold happens here. It   happens on this one. It happens on this one and \nit happens on this one. And you can see that also   lines up quite nicely with the peaks as well. \nBitcoin peaked here in 2014 right around the   copper-gold peak. Bitcoin peaks here in 2017 right \naround the copper-gold peak as well. You can see   here in 2021, this peak was met, you know, just \na little bit after this copper-gold peak. What   we've seen recently is Bitcoin has trended upwards \nfrom the low, but copper-gold has gone down. So,   there's this big divergence. So, the question \nis, is this relationship completely broken or did   Bitcoin rise because liquidity increased? And now \nwe're starting to see this turnaround in actual   manufacturing from copper to gold. And this next \nexpansion of the true economy might pull Bitcoin   along with it. No one's got a crystal ball. \nNo one can say exactly what's going to happen,   but I think this relationship is more likely to \nrevert than continue to diverge. Now bear in mind,   this is a chart that shows 18 years. These things \ndo not happen quickly. These bottoms between gold   and copper can take a very, very long time to \nform. Just check this chart here. And you can see   that it looks like it could be putting in this \nbottoming formation right down here. Now, this   green box, it just shows you, look, all of these \nbars here, they're the length of time pretty much   that copper took to form a bottom against gold. \nYou can see here it took 270 days and then 950   days and etc. And just at the bottom, I've given \nyou the averages. So, on average, it's about 500   days to find a bottom. And the shortest time was \n252 days and the longest time was 945 days. And   that's all this green box over here gives you. The \nrange from the shortest to the longest plus the   dotted line in the middle being the average. And \nyou can see right now we're just coming into what   would be considered normal ranges for copper to \nfind a bottom against gold. So it's not happening   right this second, but the setup is beginning to \nform. But there are some things that don't really   add up. Bitcoin and copper are both liquidity \nplays. When money's flowing, both should rise.   Yet, copper has been at all-time highs and Bitcoin \nhas been stuck down from the 126k peak in October   and looks like it could be heading into a bear \nmarket. So, why the divergence? You've probably   seen this chart a million times. It's Bitcoin \noverlaid with the Purchasing Managers Index. The   index that says, is the economy growing in the US \nor is it shrinking in the US? And what you can see   is there's a clear divergence recently. Bitcoin's \nbeen moving up and the PMI has been going nowhere.   But this is a chart that's just as interesting \nto see. This is copper against the PMI. And   you can see basically it's the same thing. When \ncopper runs, the PMI is moving higher. The PMI   is above 50. When copper is contracting, again, \nthe PMI is under 50 or it's going back down. This   isn't surprising. This is exactly what you would \nexpect to see because copper is a heavy industry   metal. Obviously, the Purchasing Managers Index is \nsaying, are you buying more stuff than last month?   Yes or no? If they're buying more copper, they're \nproducing more stuff. The price of copper should   be rising. These two things have traded very, \nvery closely. The relationship is about 0.91. This   relationship looks like it's massively diverged. \nNow, why the change? Why the divergence? This   is what I think is happening. Copper and the PMI \nare measuring different portions, different parts   of the economy. Buried in the ISM data was this \ncomputer and electronics products expanded in six   of the last 12 months. Second half surged likely \nfrom data centers. Now the AI sectors are growing.   They're just not big enough yet to offset the \nweakness in traditional manufacturing. You know,   chemicals, machinery, transportation, etc. that \ntakes up about 85% currently of US manufacturing   GDP. So effectively there's two economies that \nthe PMI is measuring. The old economy which is   traditional manufacturing, construction, consumer \ngoods etc. All of that is contracting. That's   what the PMI is measuring. But this new economy—AI \ninfrastructure, electric vehicles, grid upgrades,   defense—is rapidly expanding as we've seen from \nthe stock market getting pulled up largely by the   Magnificent 7. And that's what copper is being \npriced in. Global EV sales were up 20% in 2025.   Europe's EV market share is up 33% in 2025. So, as \nthese sectors get bigger, the PMI will follow. And   copper is the leading indicator for that and \nit has been multiple times in the past. Just   check this data here. What you can see in this \ndashboard here is the Purchasing Managers Index.   So whether the US economy is growing or shrinking \nagainst copper on a year-on-year percentage basis.   So was it going up that year on average or was it \ngoing down that year on average? You can see that   basically these two symbols they kind of trade one \nto one, right? This white line in the middle is   the zero line. When they're above zero, you know, \ncopper price is going up or the PMI is above 50   and expanding. And when it's beneath zero, PMI \nis contracting or copper is going down. And you   can see that basically when you run through here \nfrom 1950 onwards, the blue line goes up, gold   line is also going up. The blue line goes down, \nthe gold line is also going down. And it happens   pretty much throughout all of history until now. \nWhere we are right now, there's a big divergence.   Copper has gone upwards and the PMI is still \nunderneath 50, still contracting. So this is where   this divergence is coming from. The setup remains \nvery simple. Copper is telling us something about   where the world is going and historically when \nthe world goes in that direction, Bitcoin has   tagged along for the ride. So what am I doing with \nall this information? To be honest, the same thing   that I always do, which is I'm not really trying \nto time the copper Bitcoin divergence. I'm not   making levered bets on when the PMI recovers. The \nUS economy is definitely in a very odd place right   now. No one really knows what's going to happen. \nConsumer sentiment is dying. Stocks are ripping.   There's enormous spend in capital expenditure \nfor AI heightened by this drive for copper,   etc. But other industries are really struggling. \nCopper sees growth before the data does. The   copper gold ratio is forming a bottom. It looks \nlike historically that's preceded every major   Bitcoin cycle. We've had three major copper super \ncycles in modern history. Electrification of the   Western world in the late 1800s and you \nknow the early 1900s. Post-World War II,   the rebuild required substantial quantities \nof copper. And the rise of China in the 2000s.   What we're looking at now could well be a fourth \nindustrial revolution requiring enormous amounts   of copper. Except this time it's not tied to one \ncountry industrializing. It's the entire world   electrifying transportation, you know, building \nAI infrastructure, rising geopolitical tensions,   and even, you know, people like Elon Musk saying \nthat AGI is likely to be here. We'll hit AGI next   year in 26. The last two times gold and silver \npeaked and copper ran afterwards. Copper preceded   an enormous Bitcoin rally. You can see in this \nchart here, gold and silver top on the left in   2017. Then copper goes on a 62% run. At the same \ntime, Bitcoin did 30x. You know, I'm not saying   that's going to happen again. In 2021, the same \npattern happened. Gold and silver topped. Copper   ran 74% after that point, and Bitcoin followed \n5x along the way. We've been looking at the PMI   a lot. But as we dug into what the PMI actually \nmeans, its economic expansion, what if the new   economy relies a lot less on old businesses and \na lot more on new businesses? And if those new   businesses require enormous demand for copper, \nthen actually it can help paint the picture of   where the broader economy could be moving and as \nliquidity flows in, we know that Bitcoin acts as   this liquidity sponge and can capture a decent \nchunk of that liquidity. But fundamentally,   the vast majority of my actual holdings just \nDCA into the market every single month. Massive   shout out to Uphold as well for bringing you this \nepisode.
