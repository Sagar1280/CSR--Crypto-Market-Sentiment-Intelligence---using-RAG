  "transcript": "It looks like it actually might get worse. We are here. Complacency. We just need a cool off for the next big rally. At least that's what some prominent technical analysts are reporting. Friend of the channel Cryptoface writes, \"Just look at the white circles after money flow bull run humps. The RSIs have that W dip below the 60 line. Every time you see that W dip, W dip, w dip, w dip. It goes up just enough to fool us town folk into thinking it's going to keep going up than whammy. I'm starting to think this has a greater chance of happening. That in the short term, if Bitcoin's price falls off of a cliff, there will be three reasons for this. One, Clarity Act issues. Two, Jerome Powell/Fed problems. and three, US government shutdown, a new one. These three potential problems would be catastrophic to the Bitcoin crypto bullc case in Q1 of 2026. So, I'm bullish on Bitcoin long-term. I'm actually bullish in Bitcoin in 2026, but we have a few headwinds in the short term where if all three of these things occur in Q1 2026 and they all occur to a, you know, significant degree, I think it is possible that we could see a a full correction low of the November 2025 dip. And actually, we could even go lower than the November 2025 low. We could hit about $75,000. That would be old cycles uh resistance now turn support. A lot of buyers at that level. And that would be a full 40% correction from last year's highs. So we are here from a TA standpoint potentially from a fundamental standpoint and actually in the very short term we could run up to about 100 110 probably more likely around 105 and then come falling down. We've been keeping you informed all week on the Clarity Act. This was supposed to be a great week getting closer to passing the Clarity Act. However, now it seems even farther away. You know, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong came out and said, \"We cannot support it. This is what the crypto community wanted. This is what the crypto community thought we were going to get close to. Instead, this is what they're trying to propose.\" I'm going to keep going with the story today. It seems like Brian Armstrong, once one of the biggest supporters, is now one of the biggest proponents of people who don't want the bill to pass in its current form. And he's kind of making a full enemy of the banking system right now. revealed. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says banks are trying to undermine the president's crypto agenda. >> Got the Genius Act passed into law, which actually did enable uh stable coin rewards to happen. Um, you know, the banks had their own concerns and we reached a good outcome in the Genius Act. And now the banks really are coming and trying to undermine the president's crypto agenda. I mean, these are the same banks that, you know, debanked his him and his family, right? and they want to come in and say that Americans should not be able to actually earn more money on their money. They're trying to protect their own profit margins, taking money out of the, you know, pockets of hardworking average Americans and putting it into the coffers of these big banks that are hitting record profits. And so our view is that there should be a level playing field where banks and crypto companies can lean into stable coin legislation as an opportunity. And that includes paying rewards uh to Americans so that they can earn more money on their money. Not to mention, and excuse my phraseology, not to mention the absolute clown show we're seeing going on in crypto right now. Tom Lee's Ethereum treasury company is supposed to buy and stake ETH. My Ethereum per share should be going up. And instead, what does he do? Takes $200 million to buy into Mr. Beast's Beasts Industries. So, let me get this straight. Tom Lee's Ethereum buying and staking company instead of buying ETH is buying shares in Mr. Beast. I like Mr. Beast, but how does this make sense for a crypto company? Someone please explain this to me. Beast Industries, you know, is a a very unique company. I mean for us I think as just an investment and you know being part of the cap table where there are some really high quality venture capitalists and other investors uh represents a good investment opportunity for us or what we call a moonshot. And even more interesting on the Clarity Act, some people, despite everything going on, some analysts like billionaire Mike Novagrat's poster boy of Wall Street turned crypto. He thinks the bill in a good form could still pass in the next few weeks. Big if true. >> We're down in DC. I spent I spent a day and a half down there this week. Uh I fundamentally think a bill is going to get done in the next few weeks. Uh, the Democratic senators in earnest want to get something done. The Republican senators in earnest want to get something done. These are complicated bills. Um, I mean, it would be complicated if me and you sat down and try to write the bill, but when everyone is pushing for their own agenda, >> right? >> And then I don't know how XRP holders feel about this. Maybe it's already congruent to the brand that XRP is, but the Ripple CEO is coming out saying, \"Hey, don't listen to Brian Armstrong. The bill is good enough. Clarity is always better than chaos. The bill isn't perfect, but it's way better than nothing. We're so close. We can't give up now. Do XRP holders want the bill signed now as is? >> Clarity is always better than chaos. And the industry needs clarity. Perfection. I think in my experience, like is the market structure bill that's pending in the banking committee, is it perfect? No, certainly not. But is it better than nothing? Absolutely. And I think uh we need to con continue to work constructively with Washington to get and continue iterate what is already sitting in front of the banking committee to make it better. But we shouldn't give up now. We are so close. And still other big global news about crypto. Iran's crypto ecosystem is spiking hard 7.8 billion amid mass protests. This is perch chain analysis. Just in Bellarus central bank just said that Bitcoin and crypto banks could launch within 6 months 2026 the year banks adopt Bitcoin. Also just in Muldova to legalize Bitcoin and crypto trading in 2026. This is according to Eurasia Daily. We have been keeping you in the know on all of this on our Twitter. We just hit 2 million followers. Bullish. Russia has finalized its draft bill to legalize crypto trading. Now it seems Russia is moving ahead of US in crypto regulation. But still the canary in the coal mine big entities continue to move forward with the Goldman Sachs CEO saying that Goldman Sachs is spending a lot of time on crypto tokenization and stable coins. This seems like a dog whistle to be bullish. So we are not out of the woods yet. Although I am bullish in 2026. Right now in Q1 we do have to get past some headwinds. Hey, make sure you watch our interview with Hey, make sure you watch our interview with Giovani and Cointelegraph. In a new interview, Altcoin Daily shares his 2026 crypto outlook, covering Bitcoin and Ethereum targets, shifting market cycles, and how institutional adoption is reshaping crypto. This was a really good interview. Make sure you check it out. This is a pivotal [music] time. Right now, crypto has entered its 1996 moment. What do I mean by that? Retail will come back. It is inevitable. A 5x [music] I mean that would be my bullc case. I don't think that's a likely outcome. 2x [music] 3x I think that's more likely. >> You are thinking about changing your the name of your [music] channel to Bitcoin Daily. >> We're going to keep you informed here on Altcoin Daily.
