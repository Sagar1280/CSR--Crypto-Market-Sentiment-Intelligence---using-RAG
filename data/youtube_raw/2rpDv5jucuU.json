  "transcript": "Every once in a while, two people look at the same future and see completely different worlds. One calls for the biggest crash since 1930s. The other says Bitcoin's on a one-way path to a million dollars. When both have decades of data and conviction behind them, you guys should listen. On one side, Henrik Zeberg. You guys know him well. Friend of the show. He's the head macroeconomist at Swissblock, a datadriven market historian who's built his career connecting global liquidity, business cycles, and asset bubbles. He believes the world is entering the late stages of an everything bubble, and Bitcoin is standing right on the top of it. >> There is so much technical evidence that shows that we have a very, very big top coming in Bitcoin. On the other side, Fred Krueger, a Stanford PhD mathematician, former Wall Street quant, and lifelong entrepreneur. He sees Bitcoin as a destiny, the most important invention since the internet, and the only asset that can survive what's coming next. >> So, I have a completely opposite perspective. Uh, my perspective is Bitcoin is on a trajectory to over a million. Both men see the same storm, but they read it in completely different languages. Charts versus code, cycles versus super cycles, economist verse mathematician. And the moment the conversation begins, you guys can feel the frameworks collide. you're ready to take pretty much a full complete wipe out of your portfolio and then say it's be it's because Bitcoin is my uh is my religion and I trust it and it's not going to and it's going to be much higher in 10 years because the world is changing. That is pretty much what he's saying. >> That's where the clash begins. Henrik argues that faith has replaced analysis and conviction has turned into blindness. >> I have 80% of my net worth in Bitcoin. I'm a Bitcoin believer. I think uh people trying to time Bitcoin are always they always get it wrong. >> You don't understand economics. That's that's clear. >> I'm not an economist. Thank goodness. I am a mathematician. However, >> I have a PhD in math unlike you. Okay. So >> So hold on. Hold on. >> Stop talking to me about math. Okay. You do not know what the you're talking about with respect to math. >> At this point, it stops being a debate. It becomes a full force collision. Data smashing into belief. models crashing into conviction and two world views fighting for the steering wheel. And just when tensions peak, Henrik drops a warning that silences the room. >> It's been the going to be the worst recession you've seen since the 1930s. >> This is not just another Bitcoin discussion. It's the defining clash between macro realism and monetary revolution, between two brilliant minds who agree on almost nothing except that the next decade will rewrite everything we think we knew. So guys, stay locked in because by the end of this conversation, you'll know exactly whose framework you believe, the economist data or the mathematician's conviction. Tell me in the comments, guys, who do you agree with more, Henrik or Fred, and why? And again, remember nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. And without further ado, guys, let's jump into this very heated discussion with Fred and Henrik. Henrik, Fred, welcome to the channel. Uh, it's great to have both of you. We've talked at length before about both of your thesises, and there's obviously some sort of disagreement, which is totally fine. And I think everybody in the space has their own opinion about the way that things are going and uh you know I have my own obviously my audience knows that and you know I but I even though I think a lot of the people are completely wrong but I think all of us who have developed a thesis based on what we believe to be correct uh based the research that we've done believe that our thesis is is superior to others. So, uh, but I still respect other people's thesises, want to hear them out, and see, uh, if I can learn something from them that maybe I didn't see before. Maybe I learned something new. So, I'm very interested today to revisit both of you guys' ideas and see what I can learn from this. And hopefully the audience can, too. And, you know, make up their own decision on where they think we are and maybe who's wrong, who's right, and who knows, maybe you guys will learn something from each other today as well. Uh but what I want to get started on is uh basically I think we all agree that the world is entering into a major transition right now. You know we've got so many things happening from AI uh the quantitative tightening stopping the bricks currency uh in a basically test net backed by gold and the the BRICS countries fiat currencies as well. every every major AI conglomerate talking about everything from warning us about AI to how to place displace jobs or create immense wealth. All of these things are happening right now. It's a completely different world that we're entering into. But I think where you guys disagree on is Bitcoin and how is that becoming how is that going to evolve into this future world that we're looking at? You know, I think Henrik, you believe that uh that Bitcoin is still a risk asset and it will, you know, during times uh where the recession comes, uh it will be affected greatly. And right, I think you believe that Bitcoin is in this new transition phase where it becomes, you know, I think you can go as far as saying uh, you know, replacing gold and that gets repriced accordingly and essentially decouples from risk assets and things like that too. So uh, if I could just give you guys each a chance to maybe uh shortly give give us your thesis. So for folks who aren't familiar with what you guys talk about um so Henrik you believe in and kind of what's going to happen over the next you know 6 to 24 months and then Fred you can do the same. Well, yeah, I I've been uh pretty vocal on actually being uh quite bullish on uh on, you know, crypto, Bitcoin, everything right now. And actually, I think in uh also just a few weeks ago when everybody was uh jumping over the cliff in terms of uh calling for no lows and uh and everything else on on Bitcoin and crypto, I said, \"No, I I said we're going to go higher.\" And I I stand by that, and I think we're going to see an all-time high coming to Bitcoin. And I my target has been 140 to 150,000 for quite some time. Um so so I stand by that but it's a this is as we've seen it before uh we have seen these spikes into a uh into a top. Uh the difference this time around is first of all technically we're coming to a very big end of Bitcoin and if you can just take a weekly chart and look at that and then say why is it that we see all this negative divergence we do why do we do see the uh MACD rolling over and so on so forth. There is so much technical evidence that shows that we have a very very big top coming in bit in Bitcoin. And then we can think about it and say what is it that we have had around? Well, we have had one of the largest bubbles right now in in AI developing. Uh we can look to market capitalization to GDP and is AI going to change the world? Absolutely. Is let the ledger and blockchain going to change the world? 100%. But it's not the same as saying that you just have to jump into any kind of asset and then think it's just going to go up forever. There's a lot of narrative around this like what we hear every time uh when we have a new bubble that emerges and then at some point it pops and nobody can understand why and why and when we look at it it's not just that I think it's a risk asset. It is a risk asset and when you look at the when you look at August from the next uh top we had and we saw 14 weeks ahead we saw it dropped 35% because of nothing. there was nothing there. The the the the markets, the risk assets, the real risk assets they out there, they hardly budged, they were down 5% on the S&P, but Bitcoin was down 35% and people were, you know, there were rumors that maybe bit uh micro strategy or strategy had to start selling and so on so forth. There were whales also. There were just a few whales going out and selling actually. So, it wasn't really a an a big thing, but it was down 35%. And uh and this just shows exactly the kind of volatility. That's that's why it's it's absolutely ridiculous to think that anything that is down this much this fast based on absolutely no news in an environment where the Dixie is around 100 with no recession with no real bare market in the uh in the in the stock market thinking that that is actually going to be the saver of anything. what it is is going to pull a lot of people into on the wrong side of it and it's going to crash and it's going to bring a lot of havoc to to people. So, I think you're going to see a very big stock uh stop in the stock market and in Bitcoin. You're going to see all coins continue a little longer and then you're going to see them all top out and it's going to be a horrific crash. >> Okay. Thanks, Edric. And, you know, your your your model is also shared amongst a lot of other people. There's it's also, you know, a respected perspective, especially if you're looking at things like charts and things like that. Um, Fred, uh, >> if you can give me your kind of perspective on what where things are going, and you don't have to yet reply to anything Henrik has said. Uh, let's just hear your perspective first and then we'll get into kind of >> Yeah. So, I have a completely opposite perspective. Uh my perspective is um Bitcoin is on a trajectory to over a million uh in the you know medium term. Uh I am uh it follows a power law. It I the the cycles risk asset technicals I don't care about at all. I'm not interested in it at all. Uh, I have been in Bitcoin since early 2019. Solid. Never got out. Never sold any Bitcoin. Uh, I have 80% of my net worth in Bitcoin. I'm a Bitcoin believer. I think, uh, people trying to time Bitcoin are always, they always get it wrong. Um, regarding this crash in the stock market and the timing of the AI market, I respectfully disagree. Uh I'm not mega mega bullish on stocks but I am also not bearish and I don't think there will be this mother of all crashes. I think the and the reason is I think that I think that AI is going to provide the engine for growth in this economy that we desperately need. If there wasn't AI, if I didn't believe that it was not the real deal, I would probably be inclined to agree with uh Henrik. But I but I don't I think that actually this is the this is the the human's last invention. This is amazing. And I'm not talking about Chad ZBT. I'm talking about how it's going to infiltrate the entire economy. And I don't think it's going to take that long to do it. And I think the investment in AI is going to continue and is going to drive forward massive economic growth. Now you may call that risk on behavior. I'm a riskon person. I I don't I am not looking for the safety of bonds or real estate or gold. I don't view them as safe because I think that they're going to there's going to be a lot of debasement over the next 5 to 10 years. And I think holding a lot of cash is the wrong move right now. I don't recommend to people holding the law a lot of cash. And I think you're going to be missing the big move in in in Bitcoin. So I have a question for Henrik. is what percentage of your net worth right now is in Bitcoin? Do you have a substantial amount? And and if you do have any amount at all, um is your plan to uh sell it within the next 6 months? >> I I don't understand what that's the relevance of that question in regarding where the market is going. Uh but but I can answer you that I don't hold any bitcoins at all at this point because we are right now in an Ethereum phase which means that Ethereum is going to outperform Bitcoin. So I don't see any reason why I want to hold an inferior performing um asset at this point. So in this market that we have in this rally we have now right now it's been very clear that since April we have seen and especially since July we have seen the Ethereum outperform Bitcoin and it does it also today and it was expected to see if you look at the Ethereum Bitcoin ratio you'll clearly see that there is a break higher there which means that Bitcoin is not going to outperform Ethereum at this next coming coming weeks and months here. So why would I hold that? What I hold is I hold ETH treasury companies at this point because I think they're going to do really well in this in in the environment here just as I hold held um Bitcoin miners into that top for Bitcoin. So no, I don't hold any. But it doesn't I don't see what that has a relevance to anything what I hold. I can be wrong. I can be right. What it does have a relevance is whether we're going to have a recession or not. And what you think is going So I would ask you why do you think that Bitcoin crashed by 35% in a matter of no time from Augusta into the October low. >> I think I can tell you the answer to that. The answer is very specific to Bitcoin. Okay, which is there is a belief in the Bitcoin world and I, you know, people like Kyle can can attest to this that there's this four-year cycle in Bitcoin, you know, and whether that's true or not, it's a belief and there's a lot of people who who say three month three years up, one year down, and they're trying to frontr run that. And this is, you know, this is this is it's more than just anecdotal. This is something that's really deep in the Bitcoin culture. Not so much in the Ethereum culture, but much more in the Bitcoin culture. In the Bitcoin culture, there is this belief that the rallies of Bitcoin are due mainly to havingss. Um, that's just the way that Bitcoin works. And there's a ton of OGs who have Bitcoin at very early low prices who believe that. And uh people, we've had some big sales, you know, there was an 80,000 Bitcoin sale that was brokered by Galaxy and that happened right before this stuff really hit. And but in my world, in the Bitcoiner world, we hear we have been hearing about the four-year cycle for, you know, I mean, this particular four-year cycle end since, you know, since the beginning of January, you know, it's sort of like, are you going to get out before the end? And so, I attribute a lot of it to that as a as sort of the the the kindling that lit the match. Now, where I think this thing happened and I agree with your, you know, Tom Lee on this is it happened because of the liquidation that happened on on October 10th in the U in the in the market makers, right? So, 30% of the market makers were caught off sides on October 10th and uh were liquidated. So there's an enormous amount of leverage in perk um in the per DEX world right now in in in these perpetuals especially they've gotten really big this year and so there's massive amounts of leverage and you know it was kind of everybody was sort of positioned long for a massive rally in Q4 and when the Trump tariff news hit on October 10th simultaneous with the idea a that, you know, MSTR was not going to be included in the MSCI. Those two events were enough to spark a flash crash that was the biggest flash crash since that we've had, including FTX, right? So, >> which was which was nothing. So, so we're talking about two minor events compared to when we saw something like let's say a Lehman Brothers situation, a complete selloff of an entire massive stakes of real estate. I don't view that. >> So, so if we if we had a situation like that, how much would you expect Bitcoin to be down by? If you had a nothing burger sending it down by 35%, how much would it go down if you had a human brother situation? >> I think I would expect 35%. I mean, to me, it's like 35%. How much would you expect the NASDAQ is that >> that because if you look let's let's go back to the previous cycle right I hate to use the word cycle but I'm my own brain is using the word cycle right but uh in the previous cycle right we had five drops of over 20%. You know including the China mining ban which dropped at 50%. Okay. Including the uh the the 50% drop in um March of 2020 with um with co right so there was there's been a lot of drops. Now this is a little bit bigger. It dropped by it dropped by 65% in 3 weeks in two 2020. Just to say 65% in 3 weeks and it was and it was a two-month recession and there was no liquidity loss. There was still dollar was still there. There was not it's not soaring anything like that. It was a nothing burger compared to what you saw in the financial crisis. You think honestly that Bitcoin would be down by 35% if you were to see a Lehman Brother situation? Is that really your answer? >> A Leman Brother situation. I I don't I mean I don't expect a Le quote unquote Leman. >> Okay. But then we get to that. Then we get to that. Okay. First of all, fine. >> One second. So, uh let's let each other speak and it is, you know, it's okay to have a healthy debate. Um but let's keep it structured. So I think that next that where we need to move from here is what does a few like I don't know that it makes a whole lot of sense to reflect on but maybe Hendrickk you disagree uh but you guys both agree that if we were still following a four-year cycle then that we would have already seen Bitcoin top and we would be down down only for the next year. Neither of you guys agree on that. So let's talk about you know what's happening moving forward. the Fed, you know, monetary, fiscal policy, and it sounds to me like uh there's there's a really, correct me if I'm wrong, but the underlying thing here seems to be uh what's happening now on the macro side of things, monetary policy side of things will extend uh that will will continue to get looser and lowering rates and extend out the kind of liquidity environment that we're in. Now, I think Henrik, you you believe that's probably going to last until mid of the year, mid year next year or something. You can correct me if I'm wrong. Um, so we're not going to see any type of major Leaving Brothers crash most likely for at least not until middle of next year. I have my own opinions on that, but um, but there is a lot of things happening right now that are different than the previous four-ear cycles. And most of the things that would validate a four a four year cycle have been invalidated by now already. So, let's talk about timelines a little bit. And I think if we can clarify timelines a little bit, it could give some sort of logic to why Bitcoin may or may not transition from this risk asset, which it has been uh to I think what Fred is saying potentially is is coming out of that uh that state at the moment because of adoption, because of things like that. So, let's either of you guys can jump in, but what is your perspective? One thing here, one thing I will just say, I'm not saying Bitcoin is not a risk asset. I'm saying what I'm saying is you want to be in the risk asset. You want to be in Bitcoin. You want to be in Bitcoin. >> Well, you want to be again, you want to be in Bitcoin for the next 10 years. That's my my my gut feel is you want to be and not in Ethereum, but in Bitcoin specifically for the next 10 years. Now, >> no matter what happens in the economy, no matter what happens in the economy, you want to be in Bitcoin. >> That's what he's saying. >> Yeah. I Well, I think I I I think Bitcoin is going to do extremely well over the next 10 years. I just I I I don't believe in your economic thesis. I I think your thesis of a crash is misguided. I just uh I don't I have no I don't understand >> well I don't understand your I don't I don't see where you're getting your your your data from that we're gonna be on this >> you don't understand economics that's that's clear let me show you a few pictures >> okay yeah go ahead go ahead Henrik but but I do I want to say that it does seem that where you guys diverge the most would be about AI job loss and how >> I mean I think one of the things is Hinrich is Henrik is it Henrik or Hinrich I'm Henrik. >> Henrik. >> One of the things Henrik is saying we're going to go into a major, you know, >> let's let's look at this >> financial crash GF. >> Let's look at >> let's look at this chart. Let's look at this chart here. >> Let's take a good hard look. This is the unemployment level in the US. This is as easy and as as as light as it gets. What do we see? We see every time we have a rounding bottom and this starts to move up, you get a recession. Every time there's no butts all the way back, we now have this rounding bottom. It's moving up. And you can see the strength of this move is actually in is intensifying. So you're saying this is not going to lead to a recession. I'm wrong on that. >> Wait, wait, wait. You you you're mixing things up because first of all 2008 1929 crash and now you're saying we could have a recession. >> Why why why I'm mixing things up? I'm asking you. You saw the chart. Do you think a recession is likely with what you saw? >> Uh >> I can show it again. >> I believe let me show you it again. You think that this chart here is going to be wrong? This chart here is going to be wrong. >> We're not okay. >> I don't think I need to have an opinion on your chart in order to be long Bitcoin. >> But you No, no, no. That's fine. But let's let's take the dissected piece by piece here. So, could you agree with me that this looks a little daunting? >> Uh, no. I would. >> No. Okay. All right. Okay. That that that's probably where we are. I I You don't think you don't think this looks a bit daunting? You don't think that there's a similarity what you see here, here, here, here, and so on? >> Um, yeah. I I'm not not convinced by this at all. >> Okay. All right. >> You are convinced. I'm not convinced. >> What What What is it that So, you don't think that when the economy when it starts to weaken and people begin to lose their jobs that that's a problem? Let me show you something else then. Let me show you something different. And let's let's take the average weeks of unemployment, duration of >> 4% unemployment and you're saying panic. No, >> what's wrong? What's wrong with Ben Rick? Like we're at 4% unemployment. You're like we're definitely heading into a recession. Is something I I mean maybe I'm like insane, but 4% is a low rate of unemployment. >> Let's look at the Let's look at Let's look at this chart here. Okay, >> this is the average weeks of unemployment. >> How long people on average are unemployed. >> See this? Every time you see this moving up, it's because people are more unemployed for longer. I think we can agree that this is also moving up. Now, >> this is a flip in a chart on a very low. It doesn't matter. >> Hey, hey, it's another low level. Uh let's let's just agree on that. That's that's factual wrong. No, we're >> This was This is This is where Can Can I Can I finish? >> This is where we were in 2007 before the financial crisis, which meant that people were on average unemployed for 16 weeks. Now it's at 24 weeks. That's 50% higher. This is a structural problem for the US labor market. At this point, there is nothing that is positive about this uh this moving up where people are staying unemployed for longer. You don't think this looks daunting at all? >> I don't. And I think you've been looking at charts a little too long, Henrik. I mean, honestly, you've been you've been staring at this chart and >> what what what are you looking at? Because I so far I've heard about a belief, but I haven't heard anything about what you're actually looking at. What is it that you see which makes it so difficult to see? What I'm saying, what I'm saying, let me let me explain what I see. >> What I see is that the first Bitcoin transaction happened 15 years ago at a price of half a cent. And I see that Bitcoin has gone up 20 million times since then, of which I've been personally involved in Bitcoin since 2013. So more than half of that passes. I' I've been in Bitcoin. Unfortunately, some of it I got out got in and out between 2013 and 2019. >> But what are you looking I I don't think you're not breaking you're not giving any facts here. I gave you two charts now showing that the unemployment and you have a economy that is not well. What kind of proof do you have? >> Let's let's go into that. Let's go into that topic. Right. So, uh the Fed, right? Is has the Fed been too late or are they, you know, are they now making uh, you know, massive correction, especially coming into May when we expect to get a new Fed that's more doubbish. Uh, so the question is is yes, unemployment is up, right, which is could historically lead to a recession, but even then, I've got questions about what happens in a recession because previous recessions led to massive money printing and very bullish charts moving past that initial dip. But the question is really about right now moving forward with we start to see potentially moving toward right now they've stopped the drain uh plug the drain and then now might be starting to refill the tanks or or pump liquidity back into the markets which is kind of uh what seems to be the thesis among people who believe this and you've got the big beautiful bill pumping money into it. You've got refinancing debt lowering rates. So, but yeah, then we have this other issue of unemployment climbing a lot and this is why the Fed is likely to to be more open to cutting rates. So, I'm just curious how you each see that affecting uh the markets and it will we continue to have jobless numbers go up and yes that does affect that would affect the retail's ability to to invest in assets. Uh but >> it's not about investing. It's not about investing. It's about making ends meet. And the problem right now in the US is that the 62% of the US population right now has a difficulty in just making ends meet. It's they are living paycheck to paycheck. You have 15% of the US population right now who find it very difficult to get enough food on the table. And we are sitting and talking about investing in something as speculative as some as Bitcoin and something else. And if you look at it with the M2, if you look at liquidity, then you can say, well, they can pump. Well, it doesn't help. And we can just look at the charts again. When they pump, when they try to to stimulate, we saw that into the financial crisis. They were pumping like crazy even before the financial crisis. So why would we think things are different this time? And you don't need to take my word for it because I can just share share it again and we can take a look at what what we uh we have. If we look at the uh if you look at the M2 for instance which has been so popular and trying to predict with direction of uh of Bitcoin which was uh a funny thing. Well, here is M2 and you can see into the com we saw how that was rising and we saw what happened to the stock market. We saw it here into the financial crisis and we saw what's happening to the stock market. See this is the problem that people do not remember or understand which is that it's not about liquidity only liquidity is only important for as long as the economy can sustain that there is a rising stock market but the moment that that we see that the economy is rolling over which means that people are becoming unemployed which was the first chart I showed you that is the moment when it doesn't matter how much liquidity they pump into the system because if you're Mrs. Johnson now. No, let just hang on. Hang on. One second. One second. If you're Mrs. Johnson now and you are sitting there back home and you can't make ends meet and they start to pump money into the system, remember how QE is supposed to work. It's actually for her to save money so she can go down and spend more, which then will drive the economy higher. The problem right now is she's so deeply underwater with the facts that I just told you just before that liquidity cannot save her and will not save her because by the human being she is psych psychologically she's not going to spend those $100 just immediately. So the markets may have a joy on it and thinking that this is going to make everything better and there may be a lot of you know crypto maximalist or bitcoin maximist thinking that this is fantastic but if the economy rolls over bitcoin is going to do exactly what NASDAQ is doing and on steroids and if you've seen all the last four five six drops we have seen in NASDAQ Bitcoin has outperformed NASDAQ to the downside. So sit here and expect that if you have a crash in the market, if the economy tops out and you start to see that rolling over, which we are right now, we could see that with the unemployment number and then expecting that NASDAQ will will not drop and we not have a market crash even though we have the largest market capitalization to GDP ever and we can see Warren Buffett is starting to pull his money away from the from the table. Then I just sit and think why would you want to be in an asset like Bitcoin which has shown 70% decline when NASDAQ dropped by 25. I I really can't understand that. And and just dismissing that there's not going to be a crisis again ever. >> Sorry that I I was stupid enough stupid enough guys. I mean I'm just an idiot for putting millions of dollars in at Bitcoin at $5,000 of Bitcoin. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. I lost money versus the alltime high. I'm such an idiot for having done that. >> What is what what is what is an idiot? >> I mean everybody everybody has made money over the last few years. If you have not then you have been sleeping at the wheels. >> Well, so so so I I know people that have made thousand% also that is not that's not the point. The point is why couldn't it change? I I think that I think that well I could Henrik do you also agree that in the long term over let's say next 10 years uh if you just held Bitcoin through a volatility through recession that uh it's probably going to be more expensive in 10 years than it is today? >> No, I'm not certain about that. I'm not certain about that. It will we'll need to see we'll need to see what how it performs during a very severe recession which I think is ahead. >> It's your thesis that in October of 2010 when Bitcoin started trading on exchanges it was at 10 cents. Now it goes up it goes up, you know, a millionx to uh 100,000 and now miraculous. >> Is that is that really is that really your argument here that you say because it's been going up you you really believe are you making the case that Bitcoin goes up from 10 cents to 100,000. It goes up 1 millionx in 15 years and you're saying yeah that's a fluke and by the way two months ago was the peak. Are you really saying that? >> I did. What? What? What? What did I You You misinterpreted me again and you misquote me again just like you did on my tweet. I did not say it has peaked at this point two months ago. You remember when I started out by saying I said >> I said 150 140 to 150,000. So you did not say it to speak,00 Let me answer your question. Let me answer your question then. Let me answer your question. >> 10x. >> Let me answer your question. Do you have you heard of the South Sea bubble? Have you heard of the tulip mania? >> This is not the same thing. >> The what? Sorry. >> This is not the same thing. >> Yeah. >> Oh, okay. Why is not? Why not? >> Ah, okay. Why not? Okay, let me explain. Uh, Bitcoin is is not just another cryptocurrency. You're throwing it in the bag with Ether and you're saying, \"Oh, I pick Ether because it's going up more.\" Uh, Bitcoin is a fundamentally different type of invention. Why? >> Why? Just their tone. Your tone has that sort of >> But why? Tell me. Tell me why. You cannot just tell me something which is I I think Bitcoin is a different. Tell me why. >> It's based on a ledger. What is it? What is the difference? >> It is. Bitcoin is the first truly decentralized hard money, digital hard money that's ever been created. It is. It is fundamentally hard. It is fundamentally decentralized in a way that Ethereum isn't. Okay. What h how do you define hard? Because as I it's very it's very it's very soft as I see it when it hits a roadblock. It's very soft. >> Well, all I can say, Henrik, is go and study Bitcoin a little bit more. You really need to understand. You don't understand Bitcoin. I don't think you ever really own Bitcoin >> and held it. Have you? >> Have you So now, now we now we're down to I don't understand Bitcoin. What is it that makes Bitcoin different from Ethereum? Well, you just said you just said it. You just No, no, you said you said it's not it's not different. >> It's not different in terms of the >> it's not different. I will actually say that the techn technologically wise it's Ethereum is is superior. But anyway, that's just on me. But uh but I think you know you said to me Ethereum and Bitcoin are not the same. And I'm asking you why. There's a lot of reasons why and I and the fundamental the fundamental reason starts as to the process of how Bitcoin was created. It was never pre-mined. Unlike Ethereum, okay, Ethereum was premined. Ethereum has a foundation, the Ethereum foundation. The Ethereum, they're changing the rules of Ethereum as we go. There was a major change from proof of work to proof of stake of Ethereum. There's the change in the burning ratios. Okay. Ethereum can change. Bitcoin cannot. It is fundamentally different. Do you do you disrespect you? The fact that you're not agreeing with that is just really puts your crypto credibility in doubt in my opinion because I would say even hardcore Ethereum holders generally have that view. >> So you're looking at it purely from this econ economist perspective and I think that's a huge mistake. Okay. But can you continue with your your instead of uh just attacking Henrik for that like just continue with the the thesis please. Look, if the the thesis was the big invention was digital hard money. And if you ask me 20 years ago, can you create an open-source money that is completely hard that has that it cannot be changed, right? That the supply cannot be changed. And could you do that in a way where this thing has a more than1 trillion dollar market cap? I would say no. Absolutely not because you know digital stuff can be copied and pasted. Okay. Now there were several major innovations that made this possible. The main one was proof of work which by the way was discovered by my friend Cynthia Dwark who was at Stanford at the time and I I started a company with her co-founder with her husband sorry was my co-founder and Cynthia came up with this idea of proof of work later reinvented by Adam back and then incorporated into Satoshi that was the key breakthrough in Bitcoin okay the fact that we are tying Bitcoin to actually mining a proofof work um event okay in the physical world that is the fundamental difference proof of stake is completely different it is completely different now again this is a long this is a long conversation but the main reason why I think this is so important is at the end of the day Ethereum has no shot at becoming digital gold it has no shot at becoming the world currency for planet earth it has No shot. It It can be a great platform for smart contracts and so can Salana and so can 10 other things that maybe some of which have not even been invented yet, right? I'm not I'm not saying that they're terrible. They're useless. They have their uses, okay? They can be DeFi platforms. Fantastic. Okay, but and they could be tokenization platforms also useful, right? So we could tokenize stocks and things like that or real estate, other things. But Bitcoin is unique in that it is undeniable. There's 21 million Bitcoin and if you own one Bitcoin, you own 120 mill one millionth of everything that will ever be created on that network. That is a fact. And you don't have that with Ethereum. You do not. Okay? And yeah, you do have that with Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin which are derivatives. But that's again the strength of Bitcoin is that there are many many many copies of Bitcoin, many other things and Bitcoin has one over every one of them. So, you know, there's there's a reason why Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency and there's a reason why Ethereum, you know, peaked at a price of Bitcoin way back in 20 um in 2017 was the peak of Ethereum to Bitcoin, right? you know, yes, we're up a little bit recently, but you know, for many years, Bitcoin was appreciating versus Ethereum, okay? Until Tom Lee jumped in with uh BM BMNR, okay? That was the low, right? When he bought in to BMR, that was the low. So, I'm not going to I'm not Look, the reason I got into Bitcoin was Tom Lee personally orange built me in Bermuda in 2019. That's how I really got in. Okay. And so I'm not going to knock Tom Lee. I'm not going to knock his BMR, but I will say even Tom Lee would agree that Bitcoin is fundamentally different than Ethereum. So it's not just Fred saying it. It's everybody. Okay? Everybody would say that. And I think anybody who's been in crypto more than a minute understands that Bitcoin is very unlikely to be replaced as number two anytime soon. Now whether that you know whether you're right that Ethereum could outperform for several months maybe very well possibly. I'm you know I'm not a trader. I'm not going to be sitting out there and selling my Bitcoin going into Ethereum and back. I'm not going to do that right for a lot of reasons. For tax reasons for the fact that I'm aligned with Bitcoin. I am a Bitcoiner. I studied Bitcoin. I've wrote Bitcoin. I've developed Bitcoin wallets. I developed a lending platform on Bitcoin. I'm a Bitcoiner. Okay. So that's my lane. That's the lane I choose to swim in. Now, if you want to go into Ethereum, you're probably going to be okay right now as far as a, you know, proxy and you may actually outperform Bitcoin. I'm not even going to argue with that, right? For a little bit. I just don't think over a period of 5 to 10 years you're going to outperform Bitcoin. I just don't think so personally, but I could be wrong. And I'm not even going to argue you because it doesn't matter to me. And what matters to me is to me is that Bitcoin is going to replace gold. The ro the role that gold has played as a store of value. And I think that's going to happen. Right now gold is worth 15 times the market cap of Bitcoin. I think that's going to go the other way. I think Bitcoin will end up end up having 15 times the the market cap of gold. Now if you >> Why is China buying gold and not Bitcoin? >> What? >> Why is China buying gold and not Bitcoin? Well, central banks as you know uh have their MMO. Have any central bank bought Bitcoin? The only one that's want Bitcoin is El Salvador so far, right? So, >> yeah, that speak that speaks volume actually. Honestly, that speaks volume. So, if there's one thing you would not go and we know I think Fred even knows that that's not >> Okay, Fred, go ahead. >> Well, I mean, it's a valid question. Look, I mean, if you if you think that the world's going to continue on as it has been continuing for the next, you know, last 30 years, you show 30-year charts of things and you think the next 30 years is going to be like those the past 30 years, go right ahead. I think you were completely wrong. But on every element with that because I think the next 10 years are going to be so radically different from the last 30 years that anything >> who who who think would you really honestly think I don't think that that things are changing with AI and everything of course I do of course I think it changes but that's not the point >> point the point the point is the point is the point is >> the point is >> are you go you said into that's what I want to stick to and set my point is my hypothesis is that Bitcoin is going to crash and it's going to crash horrendously. You're going to see a recession and you're going to see Bitcoin is going to be one of the wor biggest losers that >> I'm just curious. >> I first I want to say first I want to say one thing I want to ask you that question again and say so you say into such a recession if you get a recession with the unemployment moving up and all that that we saw that I started to show you that you know what what kind of what kind of drawback pullback would you be accepting as before you would sell it? I'm never selling my Bitcoin. What are you talking about? >> So, you would not sell it at 80% draw down? >> No. >> No. 90%. >> And by the way, I didn't last time. By the way, I didn't I didn't I was at 16,000. Look, I did at 15,000. I bought >> I bought Okay. So, that's what I did last time. >> And what if it's 95%? You will also not sell. >> Yeah. If it's 95% I'm wrong. But you know what? I don't I don't think that's where I'm going to be. I won't sell. No. >> Okay. So, you will not So, what we're talking about here is that you are ready to take pretty much a full complete wipeout of your portfolio and then say it's it's because Bitcoin is my uh is my religion and I trust it and it's not going to and it's going to be much higher in 10 years because the world is changing. That is pretty much what you're saying. >> Yeah. >> Okay. I I just I just I just think I just think there's more to analysis. I think your your position is you're going to go down with what? Cash. What What are you recommending? Hold cash. I mean I >> What are you recommending as far as assets? I'm serious. >> Again, recommending depends on recommending. First of all, I don't recommend. Secondly, >> recommend. What would you Okay, you're saying that everything's going to collapse and go to >> Can I finish also, please? Thank you. Depends on the regime you have ahead. That's also again where you I know you don't like economics but uh but what kind you you know about a stackflationary regime you know about a deflationary regime in various regimes you will have to be positioned differently and I can tell you in a deflationary regime where you have a crash you do not want to be in bitcoin that's what we have seen the few times we had it that's what we had into the corona crisis as well three weeks and bitcoin went down 65% it's an extremely volatile and risky assets into a decline in the economic activity you disagree with that or >> Yeah, I mean I do completely because where was Bitcoin at that point before and after? It was way lower than it is today. I mean, what are you talking about? You know, like I'm not interested in in some random threemonth movement in my Bitcoin. I don't care. Like I you're like you're like Fred, you might lose some money because it goes down because of some event. And I'm like, so >> I just I I just have to say I just have to say it's a special breed to say that 95% crashing in one's portfolio is fine. >> It does take a special person to be a Bitcoiner. It really does. I got to tell you >> and I got to tell you >> because having been there and you know, look and I know all my fellow Bitcoiners. I know them, right? We're all we're all part of that breed. >> We are all and and China and Asia is not buying it. And that that that's what I'm saying. I think you know there is a lot of hype around this like >> Asia is through that big statement there that's not true Asia Bitcoin no >> let's let's just go with China then we agree on that China's not buying it and you have that you also see that in Europe not to the same degree this is something that is going on very much in the states right now this is a thing where everybody thinks that yeah crypto is going to be a big thing and it's going to change the world first of all I don't I don't >> not at all >> can I I honestly I think it's a little hard to to talker. So this is a thing that is going on. This is a bubble where people think that there's something new coming to the world and there is. There's an AI, there's the ledger, blockchain, all this is going to change. But just like what we've seen before, like we've seen into every big uh technology leap that we've seen with with the internet coming out with uh also back in the 1920s when we had the cars and radios and so on. Everybody was front running this and thinking this is new. This is a new world. >> That's what you're telling me. >> Eric, do do you do you think that anything has I think that uh pro Let me just ask you. Do you think that anything is different now that we have uh players like Black Rockck, Vanguard, and the United States uh reserve kind of all coming into Bitcoin? Do you think >> I'm saying saying that they will just Yeah. But let me just put a put a perspective on that also in during the com days you also had all these banks coming out and saying there were particular players that were just a fantastic and the ones that would be the the winners of the com days. This is the same thing. I'm saying again crypto blockchain the ledger and so on are going to change the world 100%. This is technology that's going to change the world but the change in the in the world there is not for some currency to arise. And I honestly don't understand why any American would like that to see that the bitcoin should replace the dollar because that will bring hardship on any American because by the end of the day then it would be something you'll simply lose the reserve currency uh status and that would be bad for the for America and for for the rest of the western world. So uh so so I think I I don't understand that first of all but secondly why would anybody let's say the US administration why would they allow it to become the reserve currency? Okay. So when you say >> Yeah. I say I say allow. So you because what what what could they do? What you'll probably say, right? They could make it illegal to use, right? >> Go ahead, Fred. >> Put your I mean, okay. So we're going to make So let me just recap our conversation so far. There's a South Sea bubble. There was tulips. There's Bitcoin. It's an American phenomena. Nobody in Asia or Europe is using it. And potentially they're going to make it illegal and it's going to go to 10,000. >> Okay. I mean, that's your view. And and by the way, you should be mainly in cash because we're going to have this massive crash. >> Fred. Fred, I Fred, first of all, >> you are saying that I haven't I haven't said these things like what you also misqued me on my on my my tweet. I I'm not saying these things, but you are jumping to some conclusions on based on what I'm saying. What I'm saying I'm saying I'm saying I'm saying it's a bubble. Yes. I'm saying that large part of the world does not buy into Bitcoin. Do not see any reason why that should become any part of the reserve currency. I'm also saying that if you're going to see a stlflationary development at some point which I think you might then you're not going to see Bitcoin for first of all performing well and secondly they will need to do some kind of monetary reset. But I think it's you know difficult to sit here and try to explain you how these economics uh you know how economics works when it comes to actually monetary policy. There's no way that the that the US administration is going to allow Bitcoin to become a a you know a a the reserve currency. If they do that then they will all of a sudden lose the ability to overspend like to the degree we see today. I mean that's that would be extremely deflationary for for the US administration and it will probably lose also the ability to to outspend the world in terms of military power. So I I just don't think you know when you come to these things here I can understand where people say this is a great asset because it's going to stay around. I say, well, if there's a recession coming, you're going to see it going to drop and especially if the dollar is going to be as strong as I think it's going to be into the next phases of 26 and um but and then you say then but I'm willing to you know lose 95% of it. Okay, that's a standpoint. I can't I can't argue with that. But I can tell you the the part where it becomes a reserve currency or reserves, you know, takes over the US dollar role not happening. Uh, so I'm I'm pretty sure that Fred is not willing to permanently lose or doesn't not interested. But his thesis is that yes, it has corrections. Yes, I believe, you know, the potentially will have from a Bitcoiner perspective, >> yes, there's been corrections. We expect them to to also be true in the future. And then and but long-term horizon is that it always goes up. >> Okay. >> Fred here. Okay. That's the that's the chart of Bitcoin on a log log basis. Are you worried about that chart? Does that chart make you nervous, Henrik? >> Not at all. >> Okay. >> Not at all. Not at all. Have you ever Have you ever tried to apply something called momentum to it? RSI to it. >> Try do that. Let me show Let me show you a few tricks there. And while while you pull those up, Henrik, I'm just curious to think if you if you believe that the US dollar actually has any other alternative, like whether the US would allow Bitcoin to become a reserve or not versus do you think that the US dollar has any chance of surviving in the next, you know, 10 to 15, 20 years due to obviously the debt, uh the the need to spend, the need to inflate, the dollar it's I don't even know if that's an a realistic option to see the dollar continue in perpetuity >> but that like we always seen I mean we we always see that there will be monetary resets during the when we have uh you know large events also and when we have seen a uh certain currency losing its value the thing is amongst all the the dirty sheets uh shirts out there the the dollar is still the the cleanest chart to be to be honest nobody wants to hold put their money into the yuang or into even to the euro because we have so It's worse than the glue factory, right? That's basically what you're saying. Great. >> I'm saying it's the best. It's it's the strongest currency out there right now. Yes. And it's been mismanaged in certain ways. Yes. But from there and to say that it's going to lose its reserve currency status to something which is something external nobody really that I just don't see. >> That I I did not say I didn't say the US dollar is suddenly going to lose its reserve status. What I'm saying is that Bitcoin is a fairly new invention. It's, you know, effectively it's 17 years old. Exactly. But, you know, we have a 17-year-old invention that in the space of 17 years is the fastest growing asset in the history of all assets. It got to a trillion dollar faster than any asset in the history of all assets that went to a trillion dollars. >> That's not entirely true, but let's go with for now. Yeah. It >> Okay. Why do you say it's not entirely true? What? >> Because the South Sea bubble was faster. But that's okay. We can we can go with the We can go a >> trillion dollars faster than any else that >> Yeah. The tr But of course you have to have it's entirely >> of course you have to um you know to drag the inflation out of that. But if you do that then the Southeast Sea bubble was faster. >> It's you know we are not comparing Bitcoin to the South Sea bubble. We're just not. >> Why not? >> Well, you know, it's a I don't know. It's it's it's maybe you want to do that with somebody else. I'm not going to waste my time with somebody who equates Bitcoin with the South Sea bubble to me and who is long Ethereum on top of it. Like that that it would be one thing if you were said, you know what, Bitcoin is Bitcoin is the South Sea bubble, but I'm long Ethereum. I what is wrong with you? How can you say those two things? If Bitcoin is a southeast bubble, but what Ethereum is like tech, so it's good. Is that what you're saying? I mean, I just don't get what you're saying. >> There's a difference between there's a difference between short, medium, and long-term. What I'm saying is that short term there is, as I said from the beginning, that Bitcoin can reach 140 to 150,000. And I said Bitcoin will be outperformed by Ethereum. And I think Ethereum can reach 9,000. And I can think Ethereum can reach 13,000. So relatively right now, Ethereum is a stronger play. I also think Ethereum is going to have a big big crash. And I'm not talking favor of bit Bitcoin or Ethereum versus each other. I'm just saying what you're looking at is a speculative asset at this point here. There is a technology down beneath it which is going to change the world. But the hype and the mania that is around this and uh just the very you know Bitcoin maximalist you know term tells me that this is uh something where people try to come up with a narrative try to find the solution to this technology and say it's because the dollar is going to crash. Well, when we actually look at the performance of it, it is terrible. The performance is terrible when you look at it relatively to the NASDAQ for instance or if you look at to so so many other things because you have this great, you know, volatility. And if you're ready to, you know, rely on that everything comes back from a 95% crash. Well, then I say, well, that's that's not for me. And I'll just say I don't think you should count on it that it keeps going higher because there's the >> 20 times on my Bitcoin uh versus in 2019. Why is my performance terrible relative to NASDAQ? >> I'm not when when when did I say I did not talking I didn't say your your performance terrible. I'm just saying that there are assets out there that will generate a lot of returns and you're talking like Bitcoin because you had a good run with it that that's going to make it a fantastic asset for the future. And I'm just saying it's shown the the performance into any kind of declines in the NASDAQ has been her hor horrible for for Bitcoin. And if I'm right that you're going to see a big crash in this bubble that we have right now, you're going to see Bitcoin crashing quite a lot and you're going to see it crash by 90 to 95%. >> I don't think you're right. So I think, you know, I think a lot of this thing it really is predicated on this crash that you're expecting, which I don't think is going to happen. >> Okay. >> You know, if I if I did really think that with any kind of conviction that your thesis was correct, I might lighten up a little bit. And even if I did, I probably would maybe go from 80% Bitcoin to 70%. Like that would be the maximum I would do on Bitcoin because at the end of the day, I think Bitcoin will continue regardless of the regime to go up to a million dollars. That's what I think. I think it's it it's growing in t the main variable on Bitcoin is not RSI, any of these things you're talking about is time. It grows with time. It grows the log of the price of Bitcoin grows with the log of time. That's a fact. It's a mathematical question. >> It's not a fact. It's something is done for a certain amount of years and that's and then you say because it's done for >> a certain amount all the years. All the years, every single year. Not a certain amount of years. For the entire history of Bitcoin. >> All right. >> That's what it's done. >> So, by the way, Henrik, I'm not an economist. Thank goodness. I am a mathematician. However, >> I have a PhD in math unlike you. Okay. So, >> so hold on, hold on, hold on. >> Stop talking to me about math. Okay. You do not know what the [ __ ] you're talking about with respect to math. >> Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I what I want to know uh for and the audience should consider here. This is why we've done this because we're both proposing both are proposing different outcomes over the next you know 12 months or so. Uh Fred, what would be the biggest uh the biggest risk of folks who listen to Hen Henrik and uh you know maybe executes or uh try to follow his strategy um over the next you know 6 to 24 months or something. >> Well my view is you know I don't know what his strategy is because he's just bearish on everything. So I don't really know his his strategy is >> he's not he's not he's not is he bullish on the in the short term believes that there's going to be a parabolic >> blow anybody who anybody who is trying to trade Bitcoin and I'm just going to focus I don't know what his his strategy is for NASDAQ I I have no idea but I all I can tell you is everybody who tries to trade Bitcoin always fails always. So anybody who thinks they're going to time the top on Bitcoin always mistakes. That's what I saying. And I have never met and I know a ton of Bitcoiners. And the only people I know who have made money in Bitcoin are people who bought it, held it, and not sold it. That's it. I don't know anybody who's And do you know, Kyle, I mean, I'm asking you, do you know any people who have super successfully timed the market in Bitcoin? Because I I'm just not aware of any. I >> I I don't I think most people have not. Uh, and then the only people that I've seen that were able to time, you know, to some degree of where it would have been better to to follow their moves would have been these guys who were on YouTube who claim that they, but there's little evidence that they actually did it. But >> I can prove your evidence. We have done it. We we do it at Swiss Block actually. >> Okay, cool. So, >> and we have the evidence for that. >> Yeah. Okay, great. And, uh, you should share that if you haven't already, Henrik, publicly. But, um, but my I want to flip the question now, Henrik. What is the biggest risk of someone following uh Fred's advice over the next you know 6 to 12 24 months >> that you uh believe in a bubble a bubble that is uh that is coming to an end you you're running over the edge that you are disregarding everything that has to do with economics that you are not paying attention to anything that has to do with technical analysis I can show you a little chart also that I actually put up on uh let's just do that and uh and I think it's uh it's dangerous uh that people are, you know, just running into it and when we actually listen to the the reasons why we should be long, it's it's like, yeah, but we believe in it just about and we I'm ready to take a 95% drop. I mean, most people are not. And that that is the problem. And if you look at the uh if you look at what you had here with Bitcoin, the run that you showed me right here, I mean, you have what is called the divergence here and uh you have what MACD rolling over here and this is at 100 something, 90,000 and it's already doing that. I still think it's going to 150,000 140,000 before we see the uh the top. But Bitcoin is going to crash horrendously. We know that every time we see NASDAQ coming down just a little, Bitcoin crashes a lot because it is a risk asset and it's a speculative asset. So people are exactly with this kind of um narrative here which is hardly based on any facts other than I bought it and I held on to it and I've done well. That is the that's the facts that are behind that's the mathematical math behind it. >> So so yeah sure so so I'm just saying I think people should pay attention to the uh to to the macroeconomic environment and say well there has been a time where we've had yields been extremely low and the the the Fed and the central banks around the world have tried to suppress yields and that is one kind of environment. If inflation comes back and yield starts move moving up or if we get god forbid a big crash that I say are you really willing willing to take a 95% crash and hoping that it's going to come up again. What if it doesn't? Just what if it doesn't? I don't think it necessarily do but what if it doesn't? Then you would say then a 95% crash is okay. I would take I will pay very very close attention to what is said uh to you know um to to the NASDAQ and say well if you think that could be topping out maybe you should also take a look at your Bitcoin portfolio and then say there can be a time to buy and there's a time to sell. Okay, first of all, Bitcoin has never made a 95% ever. There's never been a 95% draw down from the >> You have never seen a recession. You never seen a ask you started out by asking you what would happen into a Bear Sterns or a Leman Brothers kind of environment and you said 35% decline and I just showed you that it's been four times above 70% decline. Even a 70% decline will for most people be not tolerable. So I think you we and that was just with a minor declines. It's never seen a real recession. It's never seen a liquidity shortage of the dollar where the dollar is coming in the shortage. It's never seen that. And right now, funnily enough, Micro Strategy or Strategy is starting to build a reserve. Can I just finish? Can I just Can I just finish? Can I just finish? And right now, strategy Micro Strategy or Strategy has just started to build a pool or reserve of US dollars. That's a little ironic. Go ahead, Fred. >> Well, okay. Uh, on that front, um, they did it because people like you are saying they're going to go bankrupt and not be able to pay their dividend. So, it was a way of them saying, \"Actually, we've already covered the next couple years of dividend payments.\" That's why they did it, right? It's not because uh they don't believe in Bitcoin. And by the way, um, today they bought more Bitcoin. So, you know, what do you want? What can I tell you? You know, yesterday they bought more. Sorry. Yesterday they bought more Bitcoin. So, um, and and not a insubstantial amount. $800 million was purchased yesterday. So, >> lot is the car cards or what do you call that? The glass of uh house of glass you're building building there. House of cards you've been building there. Yeah. >> Okay. Okay. So, uh, guys, I think that there's been a we we we understand the kind of the thesis here. Um, but I want but I want to know from from each of you guys, was there anything or at least one thing that you heard from today that maybe helped change perspective or gave you some new insights? Uh it doesn't have to be doesn't have to mean it changed your mind about anything but was there anything you >> just say what what Henrik's view when he sticks to non Bitcoin I find him very interesting and very I I genuinely listened to all of the interview you did with Bitcoin Archie and with the exception of the you know few parts you talked about Bitcoin I actually enjoyed it quite a bit and and and so where I divert where I where I think we have a problem is when you talk about Bitcoin. That's when I think we have a problem and but you know I'm I'm I'm open for the rest you know uh I'm not going to be as sanguin about you know the state of the US economy the state of unemployment the possibility of recession. I think all these things are possible where I dis where I disagree and I think you know as far as your ability to predict an recession probably a lot better than mine. you know, I I don't really sit there and look at, you know, payroll data and stuff like that. And you may be right, but I think that ultimately the Bitcoin thesis is going to play out is going to continue to play out well. So, that's kind of where I got from this discussion. I, you know, and I I like Henrik's work on on the the economics and I like his charts and I like all his indicators. you know, he'll he'll say that Fred, you don't understand my thesis correctly. Maybe that's true, but what I I diverge when he sort of says, \"And Bitcoin's going to do this.\" That's what I I disagree with. >> Thanks, Fred. >> I think we can agree with a lot of stuff, but we're going to disagree on Bitcoin. >> Henrik, is there anything that uh that you heard today that change your perspective or anything? Again, doesn't doesn't have to change your mind about anything, but >> No, but I honestly didn't hear so much. I I heard that Fred has been buy and I'm happy for Fred and for everybody who did that bought bought into Bitcoin early on and held on to it and made a lot of money. Great. That's that's what I heard. And then I didn't really get any facts and I mean I'll be happy to go back through the video again when it comes out and take a look at it and say where are the facts of this? Because to me it looks like more of a belief. It's like I believe it's going to I believe it's going to reach a million. I believe it's going to be up in 10 years. and then disregarding everything else. And I would love to say that I've heard something that changed my mind because I like to change my mind and I like to be challenged. But in terms of facts here, and I love facts, I see an economy that is struggling. I see that Bitcoin is a risk asset and I think we could put that forward and say that is correct. So if we're seeing that, then the belief can turn into a 95% decline, which would be devastating for a lot of people. If that is the belief then I'm just saying okay then I understand it I can understand if people say then then I I want to hold on to it no matter what happens but then yeah let's see what what happens then in time 10 years time >> yeah and I think to give you some perspective uh from from a bitcoinerist perspective uh it's it's really about understanding what's happening with bitcoin on a long-term scale and when you understand how the world works as well about the big players who actually have a lot of influence in the world. How the um if anyone hasn't seen the the recent interviews with Simon Dixon talking about you know the what he calls the proof of weapons network but essentially it's the big guys in the in the room who control the direction of of the powers in the world how they are now seemingly on board and probably for a long time have been on board without saying publicly. Um, but you've got, you know, JP Morgan, you've got, uh, Black Rockck, you've got Vanguard, uh, you've got these things that are now seem to be buying in over they've had a long time to do so, but now seems to be the time that it's all kind of converging. That would be a Bitcoiner's perspective on the thesis of of adoption of of uh, at least maybe potentially a secondary reserve. it doesn't have to replace any primary reserves as it I think that uh or it seems like we're going into a multi-polar world with you know the the power structures but so even though maybe you didn't feel like there's a lot of facts I think that the background is from a Bitcoiner perspective this is uh more than just kind of assumption it's something we've seen play out on a long timeline of the path to adoption on a global scale and so uh anyway I think that's just from a Bitcoiner perspective. I'm not saying that's right or wrong. I'm just giving you a bit more context there on uh why a Bitcoiner believes that thesis >> and that's why I say it's a belief and that's that's the problem with this for me. It's about facts. It's about what the chart says. And right now we have a technical setup that suggests that we heading into something that could be a big top and I think it's um yeah, that's what is dangerous at this point, >> right? And I I think that you're you're right. Right. And so I think that there's really uh two different angles here, right? And one of them is about building wealth over time by timing markets and being a bit more conservative, looking at what's worked before, what's Ryan before, and trying to continue to believe that moving forward as it will, you know, kind of give you perspective on on how to trade the market and position accordingly. Whereas I believe that a Bitcoiner belief is that we're still ear that we're still early in Bitcoin and this is a generational asymmetric bet given all the evidence that we have. And I think that that's how a lot of investors look at opportunities is they say okay what is the what is the what can we gather here to try to get conviction on what is risky. But if that conviction becomes truth in the long run, that was the only play that you ever had to make without stressing, without staying up at night too late, that kind of stuff. It's the same perspective that a VC has on high convection bet from an early stage. Yes, it could go to zero, but that one asymmetric play without doing anything else could be generational uh opportunity to to make wealth. So I think that this is the different perspective here which I've always seen looking at a technical analysis perspective versus um you know more of a a believer a religion if you will and I believe very much that Bitcoin is a religion which one I'm a subscriber to but I'm not saying that either one is right or wrong here. I could see a world where Henrik you're very correct in the short medium-term horizon but you know ultimately Fred is correct um also on a long-term horizon. I think that both opinions could could hold true. The question is for the viewer. >> One thing I'd like to understand is in Henrik's crash scenario, does he think it's going to be like 2000 where, you know, 2020 or was a very short uh short-lived crash, right? The 60% drop in March of 2020. Or does he think that there we're going to go into a multi-year bare market? I think you're going to have a very prolonged decline. And I think that's also what I saw just Michael Bur coming out saying it here not so long ago and uh encouraged by that as well, but it's something I said for a long time. I said it's been the going to be the worst recession you've seen since the 1930s because you simply have the largest um disallocation of capital, human capital. You have structural unemployment that is moving up in the US. you have the largest bubble uh in the world ever and so on so forth and you actually also have a fiscal situation that is un unsustainable. So so the situation where this is just keep going up and going up with the kind of you know rate that we have seen over the last few months here is simply not um not not something I can see my so I I think yes we're going to have a crash and I don't and I know the Fed is going to come out and the problem is they're going to come out and doing exactly what they've done. They're going to come out with their guns blazing and this time around they're going to get a completely different result. And this result will be inflation. And when they get inflation in an economy where Mrs. Johnson doesn't start to buy food for the money or start to buy things for the money she saves, you're going to see a stackflation. >> That's not something risk assets going to like. That's like >> most Bitcoiners would say music to my ears. >> Yeah. Like I mean honestly that's literally they literally most Bitcoiners would say, \"Oh, wait a second. The Fed's going to come out. It's going to print a ton of money.\" >> Mhm. >> Exactly like they did in 2020 and Bitcoin's going to quadruple. >> That's that. And you're saying, \"No, this time actually Bitcoin is going to go down by 95%. They're going to print all this money and Bitcoin is going to get devalued.\" I I doesn't doesn't strike me as that's even possible. >> I don't know if we have more time. I can show you a simple chart that will show you that you're in a completely different environment >> by by which by without the chart. Henrik, just uh can you elaborate on that a little bit? What kind of different? >> Yeah, sure. You are now in what what happened back in 2020 when they came out once more and tried to know save the day with this free lunch of printing money like they did in 2000 and what they have tried to do continuously. They actually unleashed one thing which is new that's inflation. Inflation has this bad habit of growing onto people's backspine. So when people have seen inflation they actually become a little more worry about inflation and start to think that inflation is something can come up. So now you have a situation where um the Fed comes out at a point where the they want us you know kickstart the economy once more and you have Mrs. Johnson and this is what it's important when I say Mrs. it sounds like ridiculous thing but it's actually to make it put it down to ground. the what you know the American consumer is going to look at this and say hey I just seen inflation the prices is up 20% since uh n since 2020 I have seen unemployment moving higher that is part of this that we see right now we see starting to see it move up um and I have seen also that yields rates are going higher they are the affordability housing affordability because of high rates are just skyrocketing right now sorry pluming so the problem right now is the consumer will not just start to spend and that's why that the Fed when they come out the next time and try to do this free lunch or printing money, people will think it's going to reignite the economy, which is the only thing that will reignite the markets, by the way, because by the end of the day, the markets will follow the real economy. And when they do that, that they're going to create inflation in a in a more structural manner. And that is the problem. That is also why the Jeff Gondlack is out saying we have in >> Yeah, but I I know I know that the people think that it's a great thing to hold something that yields zero into an inflationary kind of environment. I don't think it's going to be that. Okay. So, >> are you saying are you saying that this time will be different because people because the consumer is aware of the last time this happened you know for example 2020 uh and and all the way that that that's kind of inflationary uh loose monetary policy was in full effect essentially until today basically it just ended. Um but are you saying that it'll be different this time uh because people are aware of what that means >> because of that because of debt levels the debt levels not just on a on a national basis but also for people and also for what they have seen yes psychologically things are different that's also why you've seen a diminishing returns on uh QE on money printing is simply because you see that people will not go and spend it QE is based on the assumption that people actually go and spend the money that they save if They don't the economy will not turn. They could do that in 2008 when the US economy had a or the US had a a debt level of 60% of GDP and the debt levels of people were high but not that high. Now it's a completely different picture and we have seen inflation already. So yes, I think you're going to see a completely different uh you know ending to what the Fed will go do because the yes, the Fed will come out if we get a crash 100%. >> Okay. And the I guess the only thing where we're in disagreement is you think that the Fed printing all this money is going to be bad for Bitcoin and I think it's going to be very good for Bitcoin. So that that's kind of where we're in disagreement. >> That's a really interesting thing and uh I think Henrik um happy to have you back to explain that because that's also an area where >> interest I mean it's interesting. I I'm not it's very unexpected. You're the only person I've ever heard make the case that we're gonna have massive printing and it's gonna be bad for Bitcoin. >> I I just show I just show I showed you actually guys a a chart which showed into the financial crisis where we saw a massive money printing and risk assets were just plummeting still Bitcoin in with them. That's where I disagree. >> Yes, I do. I do because Bitcoin is outperforming NASDAQ to the downside also. Yes, I do. Yes, it's the risk asset. Let's let's have a let's Henrik, let's get you back on and talk about that specifically because I I think we need a lot more depth on that. Uh and I'm sure Fred will watch. But guys, um thank you for both coming on. you know, I uh I think that we, you know, that you guys agree on a lot more than maybe you thought before, which uh I think also if you you can, you know, maybe unblock each other on X if you you know, like uh I you know, I I think that you guys are a lot closer than you think that you you might be and um I hope that we can, you know, with all due respect respect each other uh in our opinions, but um it thank you guys for both coming on, especially under the conditions of of what had happened before. Earth intent of this wasn't to to stir up drama. It was to see, you know, to really dive in and see where we were aligned and misaligned and what the differences, the key differences were because I think that was getting lost in context among Twitter. So, >> thanks Kyle. >> Thank you. >> Thanks. >> Thank you. Thanks. >> Have a wonderful day, guys. Bye-bye.",
