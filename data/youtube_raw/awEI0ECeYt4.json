  "transcript": "Last night I tweeted that it was decision time for Bitcoin. Either we held that 89,597 level or we go back down and we are and we we we destroy all the work that Bitcoin's done since November. And then a few minutes later we broke down below that level and we put in a low at about 80 80. Let me just get the the actual low here. We put in a load about 87,285. And now all the work that Bitcoin has done since the 20th of November, the uptrend that we've had since the 20th of November has basically been destroyed. And even though even though right now the markets are bouncing because they seem to have made some progress on Greenland and and and etc., it doesn't change the fact that the chart structures have broken. And these chart structures being broken is a very very very big and scary signal for where we are in this market. And that's why I thought I'd come on and I'd do a late live show because we really have to talk about what the new thesis is. I think that even the biggest bulls, even the people that were the biggest bulls, and I I think I'm one of the biggest bulls out there and have been re relatively optimistic, now have to go back and change their view and reook at their thesis because once this market structure broke, you have to re-evaluate where we're going and how and how low we can actually go. And that's what we're going to be doing here tonight on this unscheduled live. Let's call it this an unscheduled live. We had some technical issues later, but I really wanted to to bring this to you. So, we're doing this unscheduled live now. So, without further ado, let's get the show on the road, guys. I mean, talk about commitment. You know, we had a we had a technical issues earlier and we couldn't bring you a live show and here I am. It just, by the way, for me, it's a quarter past 10 in the at night and here I am bringing you GM from Sweden. Here I am bringing you crypto love and crypto wisdom. I think we do actually need to talk about this because even though we are getting a bounce now and we are getting quite a decent bounce now on the markets. Um I do think that we need to talk about what actually happened yesterday because it it's very very very serious what what happened yesterday. In a nutshell what happened yesterday was I mean look we were in an uptrend. We were in an uptrend from the 20th of November and we went up all the way up to about 98,97,771 and the the chart structure was perfect. We were putting in higher highs. We were putting in higher lows and it was bullish. But then after yesterday, the chart structure basically broke down. And what you can see here is that when when we broke below this 89,175 level, we put in a lower low. And in fact, we went all the way down to 87,298. And what happened at that point is not only did we put in a lower low, but what we did was we we changed the chart structure. We went from a chart pattern that could have been an an ascending triangle and that would have been a bullish chart pattern and we transformed that with the breakdown into basically going into into a bare flag. And now what where we're basically looking at is we're probably looking at going down to 80,000, maybe even 70,000. And if one of my predictions or one of my charts is correct, we could go down as low as 40 or 50,000. Now, I'm not saying that to scare you because I'm not here to scare you. I'm actually a very bullish guy. But I do want to show you all the data, all the facts, all the information. So, listen. What I need from you is very simple. You need to just smash the like button. That's it. That's all you do. Here I am preparing 11:00 at night, 10:00 at night bring you bringing you these shows. All I'm asking you to do is please smash the like button. It really, really, really helps with the distribution. I do see the regulars here. I see some new people here in the chat. I see I see Will Cop. He has to be otherwise he gets fired. Um uh we got Arch Bunan. We got Alex Wells. We got everybody here. Uh let's let's try to get everybody else here. Let's try to get everybody everybody else uh uh to go here. So, let's talk about I mean other than than the chart pattern and and and and what what what what landed up basically happening. The other thing that really scares me is that we seem to be repeating a couple of patterns. And the first pattern is we've put in a death cross. And it's not the traditional death cross. It's a slightly more sophisticated death cross. What you have here is you have the the 20 21week moving average and the 50we moving average. Now if you look at that chart we put in that death cross. Now the reason why that death cross scares me so much is because that was the same death cross that we got in the last two markets in 2017 and 2021 which basically ushered in the formal bare market so to speak which usually lasts for about a month in crypto. Now I was hoping that these two lines wouldn't cross but and I did say that if these two lines crossed then we go to a very low target then we one one chart that I actually that I actually saw or that I that that I actually spoke about was this level could actually take us down to $37,000. Now I broke down that thesis in this video here on Crypto Insider. And it's not fear-mongering. It's just looking at what's happened in previous bare markets and how these things happen. But because the chart structure is broken and because we've got this death cross that's just happened, we've got to be able to look at the downside. And one of the downside targets here is actually 37,500. Now, that seems highly unlikely, but there is one scenario under which that could happen. And I'll show you that scenario in in the next 5 or 10 minutes. We we'll actually we'll actually look at that scenario. I highly highly highly recommend that you watch this video because if we are in a bare market, what you want to be doing is you want to be protecting your downside and you want to be prepared for the worst. And this video over here will actually prepare you for the worst. So there is a link at the bottom of the show. Go to the bottom of the show and you'll actually see the link. Don't go now though. Let's watch this show and then afterwards go go and watch that show. The other thing that I don't like about this chart structure is look at how 2021 topped at the end of the cycle. So 2021 topped when we did when we had the 532 days after the hovering. But then from the top to the first low we went down 50%. You can see that you can see that over here. and we stuck in a region for about 60 70 days. So if you look at that, we got to the bottom and then what happened was we stuck or we hovered in a certain range. Let me just get that out the way. Let me let me actually just clean up this chart first. So let me just clean up this chart first because I think it'll be a little bit better for us to actually operate. Uh let's do that. I can show you I can show you some more of this chart. All right. Here's the chart over here. So what you can see is in 2021 what happened is we went all the way from the top and when we bottomed we were about 50% down from the top to the first bottom not to the bottom of the bare market that the bottom of the bare market was down 70% right but the problem is that when we got here everybody thought we were at the bottom and that was when we went from 67,000 all the way down to about 40,000 in 40,000 and then we hovered in a range we stayed in a range for if I remember correctly it was about 100 days so we were in this range for about a 100 days and everybody thought that the worst was over and this was the bare market and then the real damage actually came for Bitcoin because what happened is we sucked up a whole lot of people kind of like what happened now and then Bitcoin dumped another 65% and that was the bottom of the bare mark the bottom of the bare market now why do I bring this scenario up because if you look at this chart and you look at if you look at this fractal over here which is 2021 and you look at this fractal over here it's quite scary how how these these two are correlated. So first thing is we go from the top and we go all the way down to the bottom about 36% drop. Now granted you remember that Bitcoin is a much bigger asset now. So you don't expect the drops to be as brutal. Then what happened was we chopped here and we chopped here probably for about 60 or 70 days. So let's just quickly actually measure the number of days that we actually have been hovering in this range about 70 days. Now, Bitcoin sucked up the liquidity and the biggest fear is that we could actually go all the way back down and this is when the real correction would actually begin. If that act scenario actually does play out, then the targets that are in play are $57,000 and $37,000. And again, I broke that down in this video over here, which I really, really, really think you should drop you should watch and I'll I'll put I'll put a link a link to it so you guys can actually watch it. You can also see that, as I said to you, that death cross ushered in the bare market. So you can see here we corrected, we went back up, the death cross came into play and then we went all the way back down and the same thing happened in in in 2018. Now here we've just had that that death cross that's actually be going being going uh uh went off again the same. So this time it wasn't just the market the the crypto markets that we're at yesterday the S&P corrected and basically the normal Trump tariff playbook where he scares markets and then he comes back the next day and he says oh don't worry you know we're making progress don't worry I'm not going to attack Greenland etc etc and now I guess that if we look at the S&P 500 we'll probably see that it is recovering I haven't looked at it in the last couple of minutes but okay so it's up 1.25% 25%. Exactly the normal Trump playbook. But here's my concern. When I look at this chart over here and I look at this channel that the S&P has been in ever since the 20 ever since 2017, you can see that we're at the top top top top of this channel. And logically, one of two things can happen. One is we can break out of this channel, but then we'd be breaking out of a 10year channel. And I'm not sure that there's, you know, maybe we will, maybe with Trump stimulus and everything else, we will break out of a 10-year uh uh channel, but more likely specifically when you look at things like the RSI. So, you look at the stock markets at the top of the channel, you pull out the RSIs for the stock market to see how stretched the sentiment is. You bring it up onto a normal time frame and you can kind of see that the RSIs are starting to get basically elevated. And so then you say to yourself, hold on a second. there's probably a bigger chance that that the S&P has a 10 to 15% correction than the S&P actually breaks this channel. Same time, gold is at alltime highs over here as you can see. S uh silver is at alltime highs as you can see over here. And not only that, they're going parabolic. And at the same time, while they're going parabolic, if you look at their RSIs, which will tell you how stretched these markets are. So, you'll see that the look look at the silver RSI on the weekly. Okay, that's you're talking about RSIs that haven't been this high since 2006. The last time the RSIs were this high was in 2006 and then we we we corrected. And so now the question that you got to ask yourself is, okay, so Bitcoin's already had a 30 or 40% correction, but what would happen if a stock market had a 10 or 15% correction? What would happen if silver just corrected back to $50 or $60? How would those profits or how would that rotation look like with crypto? Right? And so with this chart structure breaking, as I said, I was pretty bullish because when I looked at this chart structure, I said, \"Okay, hold on a second. Higher highs, higher lows.\" Actually, in fact, if you me if you measure the days, that's o that's October 6th. And if you measure the number of days until we actually got to the bottom, it was 43 days. And then you look at the up the number of uptrend days. Here it is the number of uptrend days. We were actually in an uptrend for about 55 days. So you add the numbers up, you say, okay, we were we went down for 45 days. Obviously, we went down much more because it's elevated down and stairs up. That's how markets work. And then we went up uh and then we went up for 55 days. And so you now look at this and you say, \"Hold on a second. We've broken this chart structure. The S&P is at all-time highs. the gold, the gold, silver, and all commodity markets at all-time highs. They logically could have some kind of correction. If they do have some kind of correction, the question is where does this go? Where does Bitcoin actually go? And that again could take us way below 60 or 70 uh way below 60 or 70,000. Now, let's talk about why markets corrected yesterday or why why we got into this situation. At face value, it's around this whole Greenland discussion and Trump threatening sanctions against uh European countries that send troops to Greenland and you know the whole debacle. But the Trump administration is denying that, right? And they blaming it on something completely different. They're blaming it they're blaming it on Japan, right? >> I I believe the markets are going down because the Japanese bond market had a six standard deviation move for the past 2 days. that would be in their 10-year bonds. Uh I've been in touch with my economic counterparts in Japan and urged them to take the necessary measures to stabilize their bond market, but that's spilling all over into all bond markets. German yields are up, French yields are up, US yields are up and again it's most >> so it could it's got sparked off because of Greenland and the whole discussions around around uh uh uh Trump want to take over Greenland and fighting the Europeans for Greenland, fighting with tariffs and trade deals and stuff like that. But what Scott Besson is saying that's not the reason why the markets were crashing yesterday. He's saying that the reason the markets were crashing was because of the Japanese bond yields. And he may be right. So, what are we looking at here? We're looking at the Japanese 30-year bond yield. And what you can see is that the Japanese 30-year bond yield is going parabolic. Now, why is this the problem? Well, because if you look at the history of the Japanese bond yields, Japanese yields are usually around zero or have been. For the longest time, Japanese bond yields were hovering around zero. And during this period when bond yields were zero, the the Japanese cash cash and carry trade came into play. Now for those of you who don't know what the g Japanese cash and carry trade is, people used to borrow at 0% and invest in the US and earn four or 5% and basically keep the arbitrage. Right? This was called the cash and carry trade. And as a result of this cash and carry trade,  Japan became the biggest holder of US treasuries. Why? because people would borrow for free, invest in US treasuries, get four, five, 6, 3% in US treasuries and just rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. Now, what's happening is the bond rates in Japan are going up to 3.96%. And so those people who wanted to invest that same money in the US 10ear, the arbitrage is only 6%. And at 6%, it's actually not worth the trade. And so the trade starts to unwind. What does it mean when the trade starts to unwind? People say, \"Hold on a second. We're holding $1 trillion worth of US treasuries. Let's sell them. Let's get the dollars back and let's repay back our loans.\" Problem is that when you start selling the US treasuries, then the US uh uh the US bond rate goes up. And that's why when you look at the 10-year US bond rate and you look at what happened the last couple of days, you had this little spike here of the bond rates actually going up. And so this Japanese cash and carry trade unwinding does look like it's almost inevitable that it will need to unwind. And why? Because if you look at the the Japanese uh 30-year bond, and I'm just using one of their bonds, what you can see is that the they going up. Now, what's the reason for them going up for those people who actually care about the fundamental reasons is that Japan is a new prime minister and she is uh extremely extremely extremely doubbish. She's very very doubbish and she wants to do things like stimulus etc etc and people are saying if you do this you are devaluing the Japanese currency and we don't we want a higher premium to invest and so she called a snap election and she called a snap election so that she could get control of their parliament and ba and basically um and basically uh uh implement all all these measures and the market saying look we don't like these measures long term because they kill the long-term viability of Japan and the long-term currency, etc., etc. So, that's the short-term reason why we're getting these bounces and why why the markets are behaving the way they they're behaving. But to me, there's something more fundamental at play. And I think I've worked out the reason why Bitcoin isn't following the risk assets, why Bitcoin isn't following the commodities. Now, I know that you know that it's very, very, very strange that we're in a market where everything is going up and the one asset that's not going up is Bitcoin. And I think I've actually found the source of why this is happening and I want to show it to you. Um because it's quite a serious thing and tomorrow it's so serious that tomorrow I'm going to be making another video on the other channel specifically talking about this thing. And this thing that I want to talk about is quantum computing. Now it's been a buzz word. Quantum computing has been a buzz word up until now. And the reason why quantum computing has been a buzzword up until now is well let's go one step back. Why is quantum computing so dangerous? Right? Quantum computing is so scary because the one thing that protects your Bitcoin is this thing called the private key. And the reason why the private key is so good at protecting your Bitcoin is because the the cryptography that is required and the computing power that is required to unravel the cryptography of the Bitcoin private key is so um uh uh uh uh complex that normal computers can't crash it or can't crack it. But quantum computers will be able to crack the Bitcoin algorithm unless Bitcoin does something to protect itself from this. The only problem is that right now for the first time in Bitcoin's history, we entered what we call a quantum event horizon. Now what is the quantum event horizon? The quantum event horizon is when the amount of time until we believe that quantum computers will be strong enough to break Bitcoin or to break the Bitcoin private keys is shorter than the amount of time that it would take to upgrade Bitcoin to become quantum resistant. So almost like saying Bitcoin can only become quantum resistant in 10 years, but the quantum computing risk is five years away and that's the problem. So Charles brought this to my attention. said this is the first time that Bitcoin has decoupled from the money supply and and global liquidity flows. Why? Because we entered a quantum event horizon. The time frame of a non to a non-zero probability of Bitcoin m a quantum machine breaking Bitcoin's cryptography is now less than the estimated time it'll take to upgrade Bitcoin. And so the smart money is basically repositioning their risk accordingly. You don't believe me? Well, this is a guy called Christopher Wood. Christopher Wood, just so you guys know, massive proponent of Bitcoin. one of the first people to add Bitcoin on Wall Street on mass to his portfolio to a 10% allocation. However, he wrote a a a letter to his investment advisor and he said he's removing Bitcoin entirely from his portfolio. Why? Because he's reallocating the position into gold and s and and mining equities. And he said why? because rising concerns around quantum computing pose an existential threat to Bitcoin's long-term store of value thesis even if near-term price impact appears limited. And so he said that and this is based on a on a on a a chain code lab study estimating that between 20 and 50% of circulating Bitcoin could be vulnerable to a quantum enabled key extraction. And I mean as it as it says here, this marks a reversal for one of Bitcoin's early institutional advocates who originally added the assets as a digital uh alternative to gold. So we're in a position where if they don't work out how to make bit Bitcoin quantum resistant in the next four or five years, the quantum computers will be here and they'll be able to to attack any well a lot of our private a lot of our private keys. And the investment community seems petrified. In fact, what Nick Carter actually said, I wonder if I've actually got Nick Carter says extremely bearish that many that many influential devs flatly deny that there's any quantum risk completely unlike the philosophy of being proactive and paranoid that normally characterizes Bitcoin. Meanwhile, companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to bring to build quantum computers. Bitcoin's mere existent existence is accelerating quantum computing development and AI and math and physics is getting so strong. And this is and this is the the this is the big problem. And so maybe the reason why we are not um why we are not moving with all these risk markets is because Wall Street is hedging themselves against the bet. Maybe this is the reason why the Bitcoin OG's remember that there was that whole time that whole theory that you know there's the IPO moment and the Bitcoin OGs are selling their Bitcoin and they're moving the Bitcoin to new hands. Maybe those same people are seeing the risk of quantum computing and they're kind of saying look you know like if in 5 years the quant there's a quantum computing risk and Bitcoin can't be ready in 5 years then actually in 5 years Bitcoin is worth nothing because if quantum computing comes and we don't have a solution to quantum computing it's worth nothing. I will make a full video on this tomorrow on Crypto Insider, which is the other channel, and I'll post it on Crypto Insider as soon as it's edited and ready for you guys. And it'll break down it'll break this down in in much much much more detailed. But I think that that's the reason why we have been struggling since the 10th of October. Anyway, for now, the markets look a little bit more green, but not green enough to reverse any of the damage that actually happened yesterday. And the only thing that would invalidate my thesis here that we are now going down and remember I was like the biggest bull. I said that this chart structure could take us up a little bit higher. The the only thing that could invalidate my thesis here is such a big move that it's highly unlikely because we would need to put in a higher high and to put in a higher high we would need to go to over $98,000. So that is when I turn bullish again. This that that is when I turn bullish again. I turn bullish again when we go above 98,000. And up until then, all these are are basically just relief rallies basically. And again, I must give some credit to Fairfair because Fairf actually called it at the top. He said 95 to 10 something thousand and then uh uh he actually and then he said it actually goes down. Now guys, I don't know if you guys have been watching Fairfire's streams. If you haven't, then what I suggest you do is just go to to here and just go to 100x club. Today we're putting 100 years of cricket bats to the test to find out which decade hits hardest. >> So he's been telling people for months that this is going to happen. So go and subscribe to his you see this thing called the 100x club. Go and subscribe to 100x club. He does these 8 n 10 minute updates every single day. And I mean he's been right. He's been warning people about this. In fact, I even had an argu argument with him. I thought that this rally could take us up. He said to me, \"Look, this rally is not taking us up. It's going to reject.\" He was right. It rejected. So eight minutes of your day, probably eight minutes well spent. Also, I think now what we're going to be looking for is we're going to be looking for shorting opportunities. So long opportunities probably not right. Probably time for to look for short opportunities. If you don't have an exchange and you want to do that, go to BTCC. You have until Friday, open an account, deposit money, and the amount of money you deposit, you will automatically get a 10% bonus. You deposit 10,000, you get a,000. That's it. Then you can use that thousand to speculate with and you can withdraw your 10,000. And that's how you basically speculate for free. Don't tell them I told you this because if you do, I don't know what they'll do. Anyway, uh late show. I'll go home, get some sleep, and I'll see you guys again tomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends.",
