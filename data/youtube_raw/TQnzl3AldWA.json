  "transcript": "One of the sharpest macro analysts in the \nworld says global liquidity may be peaking   whilst everyone else is saying we just need to \nbe patient. What if he's right? What if Bitcoin   really is the purest liquidity barometer \nwe have and it's telling us something the   charts can't hide? The same thing it showed \nus at every single peak. The question is,   did liquidity peak or is the cycle about \nto extend? This video is for information   and entertainment only. It reflects my \npersonal opinions and is not financial   advice. Check the description for more \ninformation. Always do your own research. Hey guys, I'm Alessandro. Welcome back to the \nchannel. Let me set the stage. There's a framework   I've been studying from a researcher named \nMichael Howell. He's considered the godfather   of liquidity and he tracks something called the \nGlobal Liquidity Index. This is a specific factor   that he has made and it's the total funding \ncapacity across the entire financial system   and it's been going for over 30 years. That \nliquidity moves in cycles and they're roughly   every 65 months. The current cycle bottomed \nin October 2022. Global liquidity is at $186   trillion. That's 14 trillion higher than last \nyear. But the momentum is dying. The three-month   annualized growth rate just dropped to 1.3%. The \ntide is high, but the waves, they might be fading. And now, is he right? Let's look at the \nevidence and then I'll show you what   could potentially prove him wrong. This \nchart is absolutely fascinating. This is   taking Michael Howell's Global Liquidity \nIndex and overlaying it on Bitcoin price   action. Michael Howell's liquidity index is \nslightly different to the ones that you can   find in TradingView. So I had to make it in here. \nIf we overlay global liquidity onto Bitcoin price,   this is Michael Howell's index. What you can \nclearly see is that generally global liquidity   goes up. Generally Bitcoin goes up. Nothing too \ndramatic. If we add on the Bitcoin peaks here,   what you can see is that every time Bitcoin \npeaks, it actually peaks before global liquidity   peaks. In 2017, Bitcoin peaked first. Look \nat this high here. Global liquidity peaks,   you know, a few months later. The same \nthing happened in 2021. Bitcoin peaked,   global liquidity peaked a few months later. \nYou can see this divergence here. We had this   previous high here back in October, the Bitcoin \npeak, global liquidity index has continued up. And this is where things get really fascinating. \nIf we overlay the global liquidity rate of change,   so if we get rid of global liquidity and now \nwe're just looking at the rate of change.   This is the key Michael Howell thesis is that \nglobal liquidity has looked like it's almost   flatlined. It is coming into its peak, whether \nit's at its peak or it's in the process of   peaking. But the rate of change, how much it's \nchanged in the last three months is dramatic   very recently. You can see this massive cut \noff here. But what you can see in this chart,   which is just so interesting, is that Bitcoin \npeaks when the global liquidity rate of change   begins to drop off. You can see here the global \nliquidity rate of change in 2021 began to drop   off. It was the peak of Bitcoin in 2017 as \nwell. Bitcoin peaks, the global liquidity   rate of change already came down. It had already \nbegan to decrease. And right now we can see this   global liquidity rate of change just ticked \ndown at exactly the same time Bitcoin peaked. Let's start with the case that liquidity has in \nfact peaked. What is the evidence? First off,   we've got the timing. The 65-month cycle is \nmeasured from trough to trough. October 2022 was   the trough. If you add 65 months to that, the next \ntrough is around March 2028. That means the peak   roughly halfway through should fall somewhere \nbetween mid 2025 and early 2026. According to   Howell's daily Nowcast data, momentum peaked \naround August 2025. And that lines up almost   exactly with the Bitcoin top at $126,000. If we \nlook at the growth rates, the 12-month growth   rate in terms of liquidity is 8.1%. Which sounds \nincredibly healthy. However, that's mostly a base   effect. We're comparing to weak late 2024 \nnumbers. The 3-month annualized rate, which   is like a real-time signal. It tells you what's \nreally going on, has just dropped to 1.3%. Which   tells you liquidity is peaking. It's beginning \nto decelerate. The engine is slowing down. And if we look at what central banks are \ndoing around the world, Japan has been running   aggressive QT. In 2025, their balance sheet \nshrunk by 148 billion just in Q3 alone. They   have announced they're going to slow down starting \nApril 2026, but through Q1, full speed ahead. The   European Central Bank is putting over $500 billion \nof securities back into the market in 2026 and   their balance sheet is shrinking by 11% year end. \nBetween Japan and Europe, you've got combined   liquidity drain that's very real and ongoing, but \nBitcoin already sent that out and reacted. There's   typically a 3-month lag between liquidity changes \nand Bitcoin price action. Bitcoin tends to lead   where liquidity follows. And in Q3 2025, liquidity \nmomentum peaked. Q4 2025, Bitcoin topped at 126K,   then obviously dumped down to 90K. 2025 was a down \nyear for Bitcoin for the first time since 2022. And this is incredibly interesting data. It \ntakes the year of the presidential campaign,   so first year, second year, third year, \nfourth year. Obviously, the first year   is the inauguration year, the second year is the \nmidterm year, the fourth year is the re-election   year. And it says, okay, what were the gains in \nthe S&P and how much were the earnings per share   in those years since 1970? What you can see \nis that in the midterm year, the second year,   which is the year we're in right now, typically \nthe gains in the S&P 500 are pretty bad. You know,   less than 1% relative to almost 10%, almost 17%, \nabout 11%. However, the earnings per share gain   in that same midterm year are the best. This is \nreally interesting because it sort of is opposite   to what you would imagine. You'd imagine, well, \nthe best years in terms of stock prices are going   to be the best years in terms of earnings, but \nthey're not. They're completely opposite. And   this maybe even leans into Scott Bessent's latest \napproach of trying to prioritize Main Street for   2026, not Wall Street. He said multiple times, \nWall Street have had their turn. Wall Street have   had their turn. We are prioritizing Main Street \nfrom here. And so maybe that's setting us up for   another year where the gains in the S&P are weak, \nbut the earnings in the S&P are really strong. Now, the case against liquidity dropping. On \nDecember 10th, the Fed announced something   called Reserve Management Purchases. Essentially, \nthey're going to be buying $40 billion in treasury   bills every single month over 12 months. It's \nexpected to be $480 billion in purchases. Now,   of course, the Fed insists this isn't QE. \nThey're calling it technical just plumbing,   maintaining ample reserves in the banking system. \nBut when the Fed buys securities, the balance   sheet expands. This is of course a huge material \nchange, and the Fed went from draining liquidity   to neutral to now actively adding liquidity. But \nin 2019 when they did exactly the same thing,   Bitcoin price didn't immediately reverse. \nIn fact, it took quite a long time,   6 to 9 months before we really started to see any \nreversal in Bitcoin price action. And arguably,   it started to reverse because of the bazooka \nstimulus that was implemented from COVID. We also have China. At the annual work conference \nlast week, the PBOC announced they're maintaining   a moderately loose policy for 2026. Interest \nrate cuts, liquidity injections to support   growth. So expectations in China are a 25 basis \npoint cut followed by more cuts potentially in   Q2. Another thing to consider and this is subtle \nbut important is the MOVE Index. This measures   treasury bond volatility. You can think of it like \nthe VIX, the volatility index for bonds. The MOVE   peaked at 137 in April. It's now around 65 which \nis a massive improvement. This is a tailwind that   could offset some of the central bank tightening \ncoming from outside the US and China. And fourth,   the dollar. The dollar has been weakening against \nthe euro, the pound and especially the yuan. And a   weaker dollar is positive for global liquidity. \nIt eases financial conditions outside the US,   makes dollar-denominated debt easier \nto service and encourages cross-border   flows. So if the dollar continues to weaken, \nthat's another tailwind for global liquidity. Now, interestingly, global liquidity is \npriced in dollars, which means if the   dollar depreciates against other currencies, \nglobal liquidity ticks upwards. That isn't   really any extra money in the system. It's \njust the dollar being worth less. So what   scenarios have we got? The first peak holds. \nThe Fed's RMP is too small to offset the BOJ,   the ECB, and China's easing is too gradual. \nMomentum continues to fade. Scenario two,   the cycle extends. Maybe we push higher. The \npeak gets pushed out to Q2 or Q3, maybe even   later into 2026. Risk assets get another leg \nup. In this scenario, Bitcoin is likely to   rally much higher. Or scenario three, something \nbreaks, the Fed panics, labor markets crack,   repo stresses return, financial accident forces \nthe Fed's hand, they move from RMP to full scale   QE, balance sheet goes vertical again. In \nthis scenario, liquidity explode higher, but   it's a crisis response and the rally comes with \nmassive volatility and economic pain underneath. So the things we're watching to see which plays \nout, Fed balance sheet, is the RMP enough? What   if they increase repurchases or start buying \nlonger duration securities? This would signal   escalation. The People's Bank of China's actions. \nWatch for the actual cuts. Direct credit from   China. If they go bigger than expected, that's \nbullish for global liquidity. The Bank of Japan,   they said they'll slow QT from April 2026. Will \nthey pause it entirely? A dovish shift from Japan   would actually be a big deal. The MOVE Index too, \nif bond volatility begins to spike back above 100,   that signals collateral stress is returning. \nThat's a canary in the coal mine for liquidity   to be crunched. The data is conflicted and \nwe're at a crossroads. Michael Howell thinks   liquidity is peaking. One thing is clear, the \neconomy looks like it is not getting stronger   yet. The PMI came in again down signaling \nyet more contraction. Labor data continues   to look weak with unemployment rising. 2025 \nwas the worst year for jobs added since 2003. So, does the peak hold? Does the cycle \nextend? Does something break? Let me know   what you think in the comments. Bear markets \nare where the best returns are made. So,   regardless of the outcome, losing interest \nbecause Q1 or Q2 are lackluster is just about   the worst thing most people end up doing. \nFor me, I just DCA the tokens I like weekly,   I have deep conviction in, and I think \nwill survive deep market downturns.
