  "transcript": "There's a frozen island in the Arctic that just turned into a global market weapon and the shock waves are already hitting the dollar rates and Bitcoin. Today at Davos, President Trump doubled down on Greenland directly, framing it as a national and international security issue and saying he would not use force. That was a good one. In the last few days, Trump has been talking openly about Greenland. In fact, for a couple weeks, but definitely a lot more in the past few days. Trump says he wants Greenland. People are arguing about rare earths. People are arguing about politics. And almost everyone is missing the real reason that this matters. So guys, in the next 10, 12 minutes, I'm going to break this into three layers so you can understand just how critical this is. Layer one, the missile radar already operating there. Layer two, the North Atlantic choke point that shapes NATO defense. Layer three, the rare earth. Then we connect it straight to risk sentiment, the US dollar, interest rates, and a Bitcoin and crypto game plan for the next key dates. And near the end, I'll give you one macro signal that tells you whether this becomes a short-term riskoff hit or the kind of dollar confidence fracture that Bitcoin feeds on. Here's the headline risk. Right now, Trump has escalated rhetoric around Greenland, saying there is no going back. And when asked how far he's willing to go, he answered, \"Faffo, you'll find out.\" That kind of language is gasoline for volatility. At the same time, he has tied Greenland to a specific push around tariffs on eight countries. We've talked about those before. The plan, additional 10% tariffs starting February 1st, rising to 25% on June 1st, staying in place until there's a deal to purchase Greenland. This is why markets are reacting. This story is not a weird Greenland headline. This is geopolitics plugged directly into trade policy with dates the market can circle. Yep. February 1, 10% tariffs and that jumps to 25% on June 1st. Those are the dates. Also, Europe is already discussing retaliation options and emergency responses. So, the question, if you don't know already, is why Greenland? Well, here's the cleanest evidencebacked framing. Greenland is strategic geography plus already operational defense infrastructure. Critical minerals, well, they're slower. They're an optional upside. Think of Greenland like a giant piece on the chessboard that really never moves. It sits where the Arctic spills into the Atlantic. It sits under flight paths and missile paths that matter. And it already hosts US capability that is extremely hard to replicate anywhere else. Now, let's break down the three layers. Layer one, this is the real engine of the story. Greenland hosts the Pitific I probably butcher that space base run by the US and it supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance through a solid state phase array radar. This radar is built to detect and assess threats including sea launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles and it also tracks objects in orbit. So when you hear national security, this is what it means in plain English. Greenland is a forward sensor position for the Arctic approach. This is why the it's just about minerals take is incomplete. The defense infrastructure is operational. The strategic value exists today. Also, if you didn't know, the ice caps in the North Arctic are starting to melt, which is why it's extreme. It It's getting more sensitive now than ever because those pathways via the ocean are opening up and they have been for a while now. Now, layer two. And this one is pure geography power. There's a famous military term, the GIUK gap. That stands for Greenland, Iceland, and United Kingdom. It's a stretch of the ocean that has mattered for decades because it's a transit route where NATO watches movements between the Arctic and the Atlantic. Rand describes it as a key choke point where alliance forces have monitored Russian submarines and aircraft transiting into the North Atlantic. and CSIS analysis on the GIUK gap describes contested maritime choke points like this as a pivotal for military movement and broader great power competition. So Greenland's not only an island, it's part of the gate. Now, we still haven't hit the part most crypto investors actually want to know about because the market impact is not driven by a map. It's driven by what the map lets leaders do next. Rare earths, they are slower and less important in this whole thing. But let's face it, they still matter because we want to reduce dependence on foreign imports. So the USGS lists Greenland with about 1.5 million metric tons of rare earth reserves, which is a huge amount. Multiply that by 2,000 and you know how many pounds that is. and zero mine production in 2023 and 2024. So yes, the resource potential is real. The production reality is the opposite. No production, but you can pretty much be sure if the US goes in there, then they're going to open up those mining operations. And here is the supply chain truth that matters. USGS reports about 70% of US imports of rare earths come from China from 2020 to 2023. That is a choke point. Rare earths matter for magnets, AI infrastructure and compute and defense systems, industrial tech, and the next wave of electrification. Control of supply chains is power. So, Greenland is frequently discussed as the future lever in a world where major powers are trying to reduce dependency. All right, guys. Now, real quick, just a quick break. You worked hard to protect your crypto and your data. Guys, said this before, don't be a dumb dumb and let one bad click undo it. NordVPN is the first line of defense. It hides your IP, encrypts your data, and keeps you one step ahead of scammers and trackers. And here's a pro tip. Literally, I showed you guys when I did it before on a video, I saved over $300 on my last trip. Most people never realize they're being overcharged simply because where their IP location is or where they where they live. So guys, it's a no-brainer here. Protect your portfolio. Unlock the full web wherever you are and save while you're at it. There's a link in the description, guys, to get four free months and over 70% off. They cost less than a cup of coffee every single month. Less than one cup for the entire month. How like how is that not so obvious? So don't wait for a hack or security breach or data brokers or whatever to to reach you through leaked data, these kind of things. So guys, hit that link in the description to get up to 4 months free and over 70% off. Don't wait for the hack to learn the hard way. Use Nord like I do. Stay private, stay protected, and stay ahead. Okay, now we bring it home. Trump ties Green Limb to tariffs that turns in a geopolitical standoff into an economic policy shock and markets have already shown you the reflex. Reuters reported a riskoff tone. Stocks dropped and the dollar weakened against classic safe havens like the yen and Swiss frank while gold and silver, well, they hit record highs. Another Reuters piece described the sell America framing re-emerging with the dollar on the back foot while European currencies bounced. This is the part that matters for crypto. When policy uncertainty originates from the US, the dollar can lose its usual safe haven glow. Now about rates, tariffs push in two directions at the same time. They can add inflation pressure through higher import costs. They can also hit growth expectations by tightening financial conditions and chilling trade. At least this is what's being reported by the media. In my personal opinion, neither really seem to be true. We've had tariffs for a year now and inflation is flat to slightly down since tariffs started. But if you want to see the direction it's actually heading, let's take a look at trueflation. You can see here from true inflation it's actually and this is a leading indicator because this this collects real-time data and we don't have to wait for prints from the Bureau of Economics and Labor and you can see right now it's printed at 1.42. So this has been right if you line it up con you know compared to inflation and you just line up these charts you'll see that it's a leading indicator. So we are probably likely even headed down from here. And regarding growth expectations, I've seen many projections that we are likely to hit the 5% plus GDP mark by the end of the year. This means that companies earn more, valuations expand, and as long as the Fed policy doesn't constrict, this is very bullish for risk assets. Let me know in the comments, guys, if you'd like me to do a deeper dive on this topic. I think it's fascinating and paints a bigger picture for 2026. I'm also looking at things like metals and especially copper. So, if you guys want me to do that whole show, let me know in the comments below. With this being said, the current news about massive geopolitical events is shaking markets now. The Fed policy has stopped tightening as of December 1st, but we haven't entered into a fullblown easing policy yet. However, I do expect that to happen gradually throughout the year. And now, back to why markets are reacting the way they are right now. In Reuters market coverage, the immediate move showed a flight toward safety with bonds rallying alongside other safe havens. So the macro battlefield becomes volatility up, confidence fragile, and the market starts repricing the risk premium on US policy. So where does Bitcoin fit in a Greenland tariff world? Bitcoin trades like two assets depending on the macro temperature. a high beta risk asset during sudden riskoff waves and a monetary escape hatch when confidence in currencies and policy stability cracks. In the first phase, markets tend to sell what they can and crypto can get hit with everything else. In the second phase, when the story becomes dollar credibility and policy risk premium, Bitcoin starts acting like a pressure valve. And right now, the dollar reaction is the clue. Reuters explicitly pointed out this unusual dynamic. Geopolitical risk originating from the US has lined up with the dollar weakness rather than strength. So here's a practical playbook I'd use to stay sane. One, watch the dates because the market will. We got the first tear up step and then the escalation on June 1st. Europe is already preparing retaliatory measures and discussing significant countermeasures. Two, the dollar and rates as your macro compass. When the dollar is weakening alongside rising policy volatility, that is the environment where Bitcoin narratives strengthen. Three, keep your crypto exposure shaped like a pyramid. The base layer, Bitcoin and probably ETH because it tends to be the most resilient liquidity magnet. Mid layer, the majors that you understand and pay attention to should just be a couple of them, maybe two, three maximum. And the top layer are your altcoins, your high conviction bets, the higher riskreward, but it shouldn't be so much of the it shouldn't be so much of your of your portfolio that you're going to lose sleep at night. All right, guys. That's going to wrap it up for today. Until next time, stay sharp, stack your Toshi's, and I'll see you on the next one.",
