  "transcript": "Hey everyone, thanks for jumping back into the heavy metal verse. Today we're going to talk about the metal mania that we find ourselves in. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and check out into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse.com. You can also check out the new website.com as well. So gold is at a very important level arguably uh trying to get above 5K. We know 5K is not going to be an easy level. We saw Tesla get um we saw Tesla find resistance at around that 500 level. Uh if you go look at that, right, Tesla kind of struggled on that first approach to 500. Obviously Ethereum really struggled with 5K as well. It even topped out at around 4,956. So, gold is at kind of the same level, right, as the areas they got rejected at. Hopefully, it can make it through. Um, but it is a big level, right? Like 5K is a big level. We're at a It seems like somewhat of a manic time where, you know, everything is absolutely crazy. Everyone knows like some top is coming. It's just no one knows when the hell it's actually going to happen. you know, is it going to happen in January or is it going to be in February or March or April? My guess, my guess is that the top will likely be uh sometime, and again, I I might change my mind on this, but I I think it'll be sometime in the next like few months, probably Q1 or early Q2 at the latest. And one of the reasons I say that is if you look at like the year-to- date ROI of gold in midterm years. So you have uh let's look at 2026 first. If you look at um where's this other one? Okay. So so this is 2026, right? It's been up only essentially. Uh if you compare it to 2022, you can see 2022 topped out about like February, March or so. uh 2018 it topped out kind of around now, right? Maybe another day or two. That was 2018. 2014 it topped out like in March. But what you'll see is that all of them bled into the third quarter of the year, right? So if you go back further though, that's not always true. like 2010. Um, they did not bleed into Q3, but there's a lot of years where that's kind of how it how it goes where you'll find some type of a low in the third quarter of the year. 2002 is not as bad, but um, just put that on your radar. Now, if you look at silver, if you look at silver and we look at the year-to- date ROI of that, and you look at 2026 and you compare that to 2022, I mean, silver is just going absolutely manic right now, which is why it's called Metalmania, right? Like, uh, here's 2018, here's 2014, 2010. You can see it it it this one is is certainly exceeding expectations. So, we know 5K is a difficult level for gold. Uh hopefully, I mean, I hope it can break through personally. If you keep going down, the the bigger level right now is potentially this $100 level on silver. This seems like a a pretty important level. This is the thing is like when you look at a chart like this like it you're not like I think a lot of people think like oh like I'm going to be the very smart person and call a top and they've been saying it for months and then it's like it just keeps going higher and then they just kind of get quiet and quiet and quiet and then eventually they'll wake back up anytime there's a big drop. But the hard part about these moves when you when you have found yourself bullish on something like gold or silver for a long time is just like letting it ride through this rally because I think a lot of the a lot of the gains happen so quickly and people sell out all the way up and then before you know it like silver, you know, went far beyond anyone's reasonable expectations, right? Like look at the rally that it had back in in 1980. If you were to compare the extension of say its 200 week or let's go to the extension from the 20week moving average back in 1980 to today. You can see that um I believe yeah like silver is about what 65% above its 20we moving average. That's pretty significant. it it doesn't do that very frequently, but the last time it did it was in 1979. And when it was that price, silver still continued to rally for a few more weeks. And then it topped and then we went into a recession, right? That's basically what happened. And so that's like why I say like I there a lot of people think there's going to be like some massive rotation into altcoins or something like whenever silver and gold top out. But in reality, what's more likely to happen when when silver and gold top out is that risk assets than than drop. So you could argue the party goes on as long as metals stay bullish. And then when metals flip bearish, the party's over everywhere. That that's that's kind of where that's where that's the phase of the business cycle we currently find ourselves in, right? It's like when metals flip bearish, it's over in the other asset classes as well. Um, so that's why I just keep talking about metals day in and day out because like there's always a bull market somewhere and whenever the bull market's over here, then it's probably going to be over other places, too. You could already argue it is already over in other places like crypto for a while, at least until maybe the third quarter, fourth quarter of the year. Um, but you you won't see the sort of the larger drops until until metals start to show that weakness. So that's what we're looking at. I mean, this is outright and this is absolute mania in silver right now. Absolute mania approaching $100. Um, one of the things if you go to a log scale and um, and you actually go to something like gold. Was it gold I wanted to look at? No, I think it was actually silver. If we zoom out here, let's look at like monthly time frames. So, like if you were to take a bar pattern from like this high to that high on silver, like it it's actually kind of similar. Like you you see the similarities here between like what happened right there and then like what's happening right now. And and so what happened back then is that, you know, silver broke through um it broke through and and went all the way up to like 50, right? You can see it went all the way up to around 50 48 or so and then it ultimately got rejected. So when I look at a chart like this, if you overlay that silver chart, I think there will be a big drop and I could see it happening going into the third quarter of the year. this fractal here, if you just kind of look at where that low would be, would be the third quarter of the year. And as we said earlier with the year-to- date ROI, that's often times where you'll find a low by these metals is in Q3. So, what happens, and I I'm just spitballing here, right? I'm just spitballing. What happens if um if silver is able to break a 100? People then freak out, it rallies up, and then we get some big crash uh back down to in a worst case scenario, maybe the prior all-time high, right? Where you just have this massive move and then it comes back down and bounces. And I don't know that it has to go all the way back down here. That's actually not my base case. Uh but that is something to consider. Now, one of the ways that I have been able to maintain being bullish on metals despite everyone screaming it's the top for the last few months was looking at this chart. Like if you look at silver divided by the money supply, when you look at this chart, it kind of like you you look at this spike compared to M2. I'm like, well, I mean, we're not even at the we haven't even made it to the 2011 top yet. So, I'm wondering I'm wondering if what if that is the chart to watch like what if this is the chart we should be looking at and not silver USD, right? What if it's silver M2 and perhaps the first major turnaround point or the first major resistance level is going to be the prior high from 2011 when valued in M2, right? When valued in M2. Um I see someone saying uh the the sound is not good. I I hope that the sound is good. Is the sound okay? Let me know in the comments if the sound is good because I think I think it's fine. Uh, but I just want to make sure. Yeah. And and you will have to forgive me. Um, I I I hold my head in shame. Uh, okay. People say this sounds fine. I hold my head in shame for the thumbnail, but I feel like I had no choice. So, the thumbnail is uh is probably the most clickbait thumbnail I have ever posted. Um, but you can see it. You can see it on the video. But Rob Rob made that. The guy at Digital News, he made that. And um I thought I I thought I should I I thought it was too good to to not post. So yeah, I made it I made it the thumbnail. But yeah, when when I look at at silver, I do wonder if this is a if this is a relevant chart here. And so if this is the case, then if silver can break through 100, then perhaps the main level to watch is about 25% higher than the current prices, right? About 25%. If we run 20, if silver runs another 25%, you're looking at sweeping potentially the prior all-time high from 2011. Now, personally, I think that it could go higher than that, but I do wonder if it's going to need to cool off some kind of going into Q3. Maybe it does something like this that spikes up here and then and then drops into the third quarter and then perhaps from there can then rally rally again. But again, I mean, like that's just it's just spitballing. I I can't possibly know what's going to happen. But it is something to think about. I posted a lot of videos last few months on palladium as well. Uh that one is putting in new local highs. So if you've held that one, you're also doing pretty well. Um I got into palladium around $1,000 um right here. like I I didn't get it down here, but I I basically waited for the sweep of these highs to kind of prove that it was breaking out and then I waited for the pullback to the bull market support band and I got in right at 1,080 and I put a I put a video out on it at 1,080 um or so it was like 1,080,70,90 something like that and I said that I was I was now bullish on it and then now it's up almost double since then right since September. Now, that might not seem like a lot, but when you consider that that Bitcoin and and crypto is not up, you know, during that same period, right? When you see that it's actually down, it shows you like why pivoting is important, right? There will come a time for crypto again. It's just not like it's not it's usually not the midterm years. That it's usually not the midterm years. And so what I could see happening for something like Bitcoin is maybe finding a low late Q3, early Q4 when metals do. But the the problem is that I don't really think crypto can bottom until metals bottom. But metals haven't even stopped going up yet. So that's why I just kind of turned a blind eye towards crypto for the time being because we are more or less on that same four-year cycle we've talked about and uh and and this is just more said time for for the metals. So, silver is a thing to watch right now because it is at 99.7 and ideally it can break through 100 and and maybe run a little bit. And I'm guessing if it can do that that will end up being the local top. My guess my guess is that the local top will be somewhere between like 1 to 200 a and then from there it will it will absolutely warrant some type of longer cool off period going into the third quarter out here. But that's my guess is somewhere between 1 to 200 for a local top by silver. Uh palladium looks like it wants to break 2K. The I think the most impressive thing right now if it could happen would be gold breaking 5K just because that 49. We've seen that 49 creep up in Ethereum in um in Tesla. I just think this is a big number for for gold to try to break. So if it can break through, I think that would provide a lot of confidence to the other metals as well. Uh if it can if it can ultimately break through. Silver is now at 99.8. Let's see if we can uh let's see if it can break through here. So, it's at 99.8. It's really getting close. By the way, uranium is also doing well. And I I've been really bullish on that one for a long time. All right, we're we're essentially here. I mean, it's 998 still. Um, lithium also is has has been doing very very well. Uh, and nickel and platinum. Platinum actually, you know, has put in new highs again. Um, so platinum looks like it's kind of doing the same thing that silver did, right? Where it like um put in a high, consolidated, and then went ran and then ran from there. All right, silver is here. 99.8. Let's see if we can capture it the first time it hits $100. 998. Should we should we draw a house? We haven't done that in a long time. Normally do that. Why don't we leave the We normally do the houses for uh for crypto stuff, but we could always do it for metals, too. Um, but we are getting pretty close. Let's see. 100 be right here. So, we are we are getting pretty close. Maybe in through the garage. Um, all right. We got we got palladium now at at 2K. So, for palladium, I think you're looking at I'm hoping to see it rally up to this next level. You can see the main levels that it's been rejected at are kind of these prior highs, right? Like these prior highs. That's where it's been rejected. So like this first rejection right here corresponded to this this high. This rejection there was kind of like this high and then maybe this is the next one. So that would be uh if it can run there that would put it at that put it about another 20% move or so. At that point it might be really hard not to take some profits off platium because it's kind of one of those more fringe metals that uh it's not like gold and silver in the same way. It does bleed against them long term, I think. Um, uh, yeah, but we'll see. We'll see if it can if it can make it there. Silver's still struggling, just below $100. We'll see if it can get there. Someone says, \"Let's look at gold M2.\" It's a good idea. Gold M2 is already through the 2011 high. Um, so gold's already through it. You can see right here it's made it through. Uh, it actually looks like maybe maybe the same thing we did with palladium, right? Is you kind of look at the next these some of these like next levels and I mean in this case if gold can get through 5k uh I mean you're you're potentially looking at another 20% rally. I mean as crazy as that sounds but um it's not impossible. I do think you kind of have to think about like the window for like what is the window for for where the the metals top out and I think the the window is is Q1 going into early Q2. That's more or less the window I would assume of of when the metals top out and then I would say around Q3, late Q3, early Q4 would be kind of a nice time for them to potentially find some type of low to then build off of. Uh but that is kind of yeah I mean it's an interesting chart when you look at at gold M2 because it is it's also kind of just slowly working its way up back up from these um highs that it had back in in the 1980s. Uh platium yeah it pulled back just below two. Silver's still right around 99. So we'll see if it can get back up to 100. It looks like it went to 99.926. So it's gotten really close to 100. Uh I think it wants to break through. We just got to give it a little bit more time. But this is a great example of like, you know, don't man don't try to manufacture a bull market in a place that doesn't exist, right? And so crypto, I think, has been in a bare market since October. And it's easy to want to try to manufacture a bull market there because you see other things moving. But usually when Bitcoin goes into these bare markets, they can last like, you know, a year. If it's like the 2019 one, it might not last quite that long, but it is at least something to consider is that look, look, these bare markets in crypto can last, you know, 6 months, 12 months. Like, it's it's pretty normal. And that's kind of what I think is going on. And I I do not think you're going to have a rotation to crypto whenever metal's top. I think you might have a rotation. I think people might take on some crypto risk whenever metals bottom, but we haven't even gotten to the point where metals have even really started going down. So, it seems like kind of a faroff thing, you know? It seems like kind of a far-off thing right now, which is why I don't spend a whole lot of time talking about it. Um, so yeah. Uh, let's see. Look at platinum. Yeah, platinum is is also doing pretty well. It looks like it's trying to do what silver did, right? where like silver silver put in an high and then it and then it got this pullback after the high. I keep meaning to go here. Silver did the same thing where it like went above the high, came back down and then ran. Right. So, it looks like platinum's doing the same thing right now where it's it had this consolidation just below the prior high. It ran above it, swept the high, pulled back, and now it's running yet again. I mean, a a lot of the metals in general, I mean, they've been in a bull market for a while, and you know, of course, it's hard to know exactly when the top's going to be, but the the hardest thing to do sometimes with these metals, just hold on to them, you know, and the thing that you don't want to do, in my opinion, is you don't want to sell your winners for your losers. So, if you decide to offload some metals, uh, maybe later this quarter or something, then it's not usually a good idea to then go buy losers with them. Like, it would it doesn't really make a lot of sense to sell metals to go buy altcoins. It just doesn't make sense. Look at at total three divided by silver. You know, I've had people telling me why this was going to bottom for months now, and yet it just keeps on going down. In fact, altcoins are at a lower valuation now against silver than they were in 2022. That's saying something, you know, because all coins are now down 30% below their 2022 lows when valued in silver. And so if you look at total three divided by gold, I think the argument for me has to be that eventually they're going to go below their 2022 lows as well, which mean that altcoins are probably going to drop another 10 to 20% against gold at least at least. So there's not really a great I mean I know I I know a lot of guys are going to try to convince you that alt season is coming, but there's not really a great reason uh to assume that that altcoins are going to do anything impressive against metals anytime soon. momentum is a hell of a drug and and it's better to ride the momentum than to constantly try to be a hero predicting when it's going to change. There's always a bull market somewhere, even if it's not where you want it to be. And that bull market continues to be in metals uh for now. So, uranium's also kind of working its way back up to a new local high. So, I'm as I I put out a video like a week or two ago on uranium and I I mean it's just been one of those things I've been bullish on forever because my my PhD was in nuclear engineering and so I'm kind of biased. Um but yeah, I mean uranium also looks good. Note that things like lithium, things like uranium, they operate on different cycles than things like gold and silver. So like if gold and silver top at some point, that doesn't mean that like all metals have to top. Um there's sort of different subse sectors within the metals like like like gold and silver and platinum kind of and and platium are kind of are different in the way that their cycles work compared to things like lithium and uranium and maybe things like copper. It's a little bit different in the way that they uh that they behave. Opinion to silver miners. You know, I was looking at a silver miner. Um, uh, I talk more about this stuff in in ITC Premium admittedly, but yeah, I mean, the silver miners have been doing very well, too. This is gapping higher. Um, a lot of these a lot of the metals and the miners just continue to do uh, exceptionally well. Copper also has looked good. Um, there's actually an interesting ratio we should look at. So copper, you know, continues to kind of just slightly go higher. So it's hard not to just be bullish on on a lot of the the metals. I mean, I've been saying that for months, but one of the ratios I think to look at is maybe like copper against gold. And this is kind of an interesting metric because you can see that it has been trending down for a while. And at some point you would expect this this trend to like shift, but it just maybe it needs to sort of bleed a little bit longer to get down to this um this line down here. But yeah, I mean in general copper has been bleeding to gold, which is why I don't really talk about copper as much. But um it is still structurally bullish I think on its USD valuation. Oh, palladium's back above 2K. So hopefully we can see that one run. I'm glad you guys like the thumbnail. I didn't make it. Rob did, but uh I couldn't not use it. Um yeah. So if you do take profits on metals, either keep it in cash until there's a drop or put it in another winner. Don't like it does not make sense to go by a loser because when medals top the losers will likely keep losing. Okay? When medals top, losers will keep losing. Winners keep winning, losers keep losing. When the winners stop winning, that doesn't mean the losers start. Usually when the winners stop winning, the losers keep losing. That is how the cycles work. Okay? The rotations that people think happen can happen, but they usually take place on far longer time frames than what they're thinking. Rob, you mean the vi coder? Yeah, the vi the vibe coder. All right, let's see. Palladium run here. 2008. Are we partying? Like it's 2008 right now. Uh, can you take another look at you? So, guys, I I'll tell you guys. I know I talked about it a little bit on the uh on the video, but UU is a lot riskier than URA or URMM or whatever. It is riskier. It's a lot riskier. It it it moves up quickly, but it can also drop quickly. Um, so just be careful. Be careful with some of these. Silver's trying to work its way back up to 100, but it's still at 99.5 right now. Uh, we got lithium. This is a a stock that kind of tracks it, but it's it's still doing well. Kind of following that same pattern of, you know, like sweeping a high, coming back down, and then rallying back up. Same pattern we saw with USDT dominance plus USDC dominance, right? We talked about that a lot, how it would likely get this pullback and then rally. And it is starting to rally. I don't know if it's if the pullback's over or not, but ultimately stable coin dominance will likely go higher into the summer. Now, Palladium's partying like it's 2009. URA is up to 57. Um, just day in and day out these metals go keep going up. Uh, gold still stuck right around that 4950 mark. So, this is going to be a difficult spot for it to get through. I will say this, if gold can break 5K, it really opens the door for the metals, you know, like silver and and platium to potentially run that extra 20% or so. But this is a big level, right? So, probably the most important thing to watch is actually gold right now to see if it can get through the 5K milestone because if it can, it really opens the door for the other metals to continue to move up. If this is where we find a local top, then I don't I mean I'm not saying that you can't see further rallies, but it's just going to put a cap on on some of the ones that are more correlated. Now, Platium's at 2013. Silver's working its way back up now 99.6. So, it's getting up there. Guys, if you're not if you're not subscribed, make sure you do subscribe, but also give the video a thumbs up, like the video, and we only got like 13 uh we got 1300 viewers, but not nearly the uh the same in terms of uh likes. So, if you guys do like the video, yeah, please give the video a thumbs up if you wouldn't mind. We're at 200 likes or so. 250 um not metal related but you think we already had the counter trend rally you're expecting for Bitcoin. So what I one of the things I'm wondering with Bitcoin and we actually saw this in 2019 um was like Bitcoin did have that rally back up. So I I think that the current counter trend rally might be over. Uh but in 2019, one of the things that happened was that like you had some shorter counter trend rallies in here. Um but then ultimately it swept the low before getting a bigger counter trend rally and then putting in a lower low. So I still think there is a need at some point for Bitcoin to sweep the low from April. Maybe it doesn't have to be that bad. Perhaps it just sweeps this low. But I think that is coming at some point. Sweep that low and and then maybe you get some type of other counter trend rally. Yeah, in the short term, I mean, it did hit the it did hit the 21week EMA. Um, it's always possible it could it could get another move back up, but it's still, you know, I I don't think it's it's one of those things where like I'm not like what I the Bitcoin I wanted to sell, I sold like October, November time frame. like the Bitcoin I have now, I'm not going to like I'm just going to hold it no matter what because there's a chance that I'm wrong and maybe the four-year cycle is is wrong, even though I still think it's right. Uh it's a way to hedge, right? So, I'm not really looking at Bitcoin in a in a sort of a short-term move right now. I have I have, you know, a small percentage of my stack from the from the bull market and then I'm like kind of riding that and and I get back into Bitcoin more so like later on this year if it plays out how I how I think it's going to. Remember, usually what happens is Bitcoin first uh goes to the 50, goes to the 50, then to the 100, then eventually goes to the 200. And I think like right now it's back at that 100week moving average, which is at around 87K. Uh but whenever the 100 is given up, you're likely looking at a pretty quick ticket to that 200E moving average. Um so I like I'm not I'm not sitting here pining for higher levels by Bitcoin. I think you you've had a counter trend rally. You will likely have lower prices this year. We likely will hit the 200E moving average at some point. And yes, we could still hit the 50week moving average. Um it's hard to know, you know, exactly how it plays out, but in my opinion, it it's just there's there's gains to be had elsewhere other than crypto right now, right? Like you don't don't marry an altcoin, don't marry an asset class. When an asset classes in a bare market, you look elsewhere and you find where the bull market is. And that's why we've been focusing on metals uh for a while. Um let's go check in with the metals, see if they've made any any moves uh since the last I looked here like a minute ago. Uh silver's trying to get back up to 100, but it's a slow process. Gold. Yeah, gold's still struggling with that 4950 level. Lithium moving up, nickel moving up, platinum still doing pretty well. Oil is the one commodity that really has struggled. And a lot of times, like if you look at oil against gold, you can see how much beaten down oil is against gold. I'm going to guess the trend will continue a little bit longer. Whenever this spikes, that's usually when it's over. So, watch oil is as potentially the the harbinger of the end whenever it starts spiking. for now. It still looks fine. Um, but whenever that one starts spiking, it might be might be a signal. I don't I'm not buying oil. I I I more so just like use it as a as a signal for the markets. Someone says time to rotate silver to gold. So, look, I I I don't think that's the worst idea. Uh, the gold silver ratio is currently around 49. Um, I'm you could still see it go a little bit lower, but I I think like if you if you were to if it's kind of like the if you guys followed for the crypto stuff, right? Like how I would always say you can sell your altcoins and just put it in Bitcoin. Bitcoin gives you exposure to the upside and minimizes your downside risk. I haven't sold any silver yet, but I am starting to think about maybe I should rotate some here relatively soon back over to gold. Okay. Um, if you go back further and you look at at the the the ratio kind of going back further in time, it is certainly possible for it to go lower than where it currently is, but there's been plenty of times in history where it will find lows only a little bit lower than where it is right now before spiking back up. So, yeah. And the other thing, too, is there's also been plenty of times where silver tops and gold continues to run for a little bit longer, right? So, like if you look at this is the gold chart and then if you overlay silver onto the gold chart, um you'll notice that there's times like in 1974 where gold actually put in a higher high in 1975 when silver put in a lower high. So, yeah, like there's not it's not the worst idea. The higher silver goes, it's not the worst idea to put some of that into gold. Now, you might say, well, isn't that selling a winner to buy a loser? No, gold is not a loser, right? Gold is also a winner. It's just that silver has been winning more and silver has been getting extended more. So, whenever there is a correction, what whatever gold drops, silver will will likely drop more. So, you know, rotating some of those profits from silver over to gold might not be the worst idea over the next month or two uh just to help preserve uh some of that, you know, some of that value that you might have captured with silver. Sold is currently back up to 997. Would I rather buy Bitcoin miners or Micro Strategy in the bare market? I I probably wouldn't. I don't know. Like I I'd probably stick to Bitcoin for the most part. The issue is that on over a long enough period of time, basically everything in crypto eventually bleeds to Bitcoin. Even the miners, right? Like if you were to look at like a marathon against Bitcoin, it just bleeds, right? Even like something like CleanSpark like against Bitcoin over a long enough period of time, they just go down. So like it's hard to want to buy other things that are like derivatives or sort of variations of buying Bitcoin, like leverage versions of buying Bitcoin. It's hard to want to go do that because I feel like over a long enough period of time it ultimately just bleeds back to Bitcoin regarding oil. XLE oil heavy index is currently a nice breakout. Might be sooner rather than later. Yeah. No, I've I've been bullish on on um I I again I talk more about this in ITC Premium, but I've been bullish on a lot of oil related stocks. Even though I haven't bought oil, I've bought some oil related stocks that are starting to do really really well and things that are just related to energy have been doing really really well. Um one example of course is like Exxon. Like that one looks like it's been breaking out. I've been bullish on that one for a while. This Exxon was actually one of the first stocks I ever bought like back in I don't know like 15 years ago. Um, yeah, way back in the day. Silver to gold. Yeah, you can look at at silver to divided by gold. You can see it's getting a nice spike right now. I'd be I'd be looking to rotate uh sometime in the coming weeks potentially. For now, I haven't. And I know it's risky, but uh what's life without a little risk? You know, I haven't rotated yet, but um we'll see where this thing can run. Lithium starting to move. Lac 652. Platinum still kind of struggling right around 27. Palladium's back up to 2012. So, that one's looking good. Silver now at 998. All right, let's see if we can uh go in through the garage here. silver to gold or silver to Bitcoin? Probably not silver to Bitcoin because the issue is that whenever silver corrects like Bitcoin also likely corrects. That's the problem is that like it's the same mistake. You guys remember back in October when a lot of people made the mistake of assuming that like alts would rally after Bitcoin tops, but we talked about how this was more similar to the 2019 rally and how there was no rotation to altcoins after Bitcoin topped in 2019. We talked about that because of the similarities between quantitative tightening back then and today and sort of the lowering interest rates but not as low as they probably need to be for crypto to really start moving. And so there was no rotation from Bitcoin to alts after Bitcoin topped. Same thing is I don't think there's going to be a rotation from gold from metals to crypto whenever crypto tops or sorry whenever whenever metals. Now could you have a short-term move? Yeah, like that's possible, but I don't think you're going to have a durable move by crypto whenever whenever metals, just like there was no durable move from Bitcoin to altcoins after Bitcoin topped. It's just the brutal part of the cycle where people expect rotations, but these rotations don't happen. How do you use oil as an indicator? Um, basically what I mean by that is if you look at oil and you um and you look at like all the prior recessions, usually recessions happen after oil goes parabolic, right? So basically like when you see oil start to really move up, that's usually what ushers in the recession. So that's why I've been keeping a close eye on oil and it's one of the reasons I've been able to stay bullish on metals because I keep seeing oil put in lower highs. But whenever oil breaks out, that's probably when you want to start to flip more bearish on on metals. We're not there yet. We're not there yet, but we could be there soon. So, use oil as a signal to figure out when are these other assets going to start topping out. And the reason they would start topping out potentially was if oil starts spiking that, you know, that might sort of raise inflation concerns, might make it so it might be harder for the Fed to want to cut. Watch oil as a signal. I'm not necessarily I'm not saying, hey, go trade oil futures or anything like that. I'm saying use it as a signal. I I do buy some oil stocks because I do think oil will likely spike. A lot of times you might think, well, if we go into a recession, why would it spike? Usually, it's oil spiking that causes the recession, right? It's it's the spiking of oil that causes it. Um, and then oil goes down. So, that's kind of how I think it's going to play out. At some point, oil will spike. It'll then lead to some inflation concerns, even though I don't I think it'll be sort of fleeting and then you'll have a drop by by metals and and other risk assets. All right, silver is 9975. Someone says they're thinking about buying stocks this year. So, usually in midterm years, stocks bottom around Q3. I'm not asking you to time the market. Usually, just getting in and and you know, trying to time the market doesn't really work out. Regardless of what you do in the short term, maybe it's worthwhile to get some exposure. Maybe more so international if you're based in the states. But I would say um it might make more it might make some sense to hold a little bit of cash for that Q3 time frame just in case Q3 ends up late Q3, early Q4, just in case it ends up marking a low like it did the last few midterm years. Is it still wise to continue to DCA gold and silver? I don't know that I would be DCAing silver right now. Gold might be a better play long term, but I silver is getting kind of high. I mean, I haven't sold, but I'm probably going to soon. I would worry about, you know, if you're buying silver now, you're buying really at a at a potential getting close to a a top that might hold for a little while. So, I I probably wouldn't. Um, if you're asking me should you DCA gold to silver or silver to gold, I think it makes more sense to go say silver to gold than gold to silver right now. But I could still see silver outperforming gold for a few more weeks before that before that ratio really starts to change. All right, guys. We're at 99.9 uh 99.9 for silver. Let's see if we can get up to 100. 99993 9994. We are getting close. Let's go into the garage. 9995. Let's see if we can make it. We've caught a lot of important milestones on live streams on this channel through the years. All right, we're still at 998. Um, back up to 999. Yeah, someone says it's 989. We're a little bit higher than that now. 9992. Make sure you guys give the video a thumbs up if you haven't yet. see if we can get to a thousand likes. Um, Platium's moving, too. It's up at uh 2018. That's good to see. Hopefully, Platium can move up to like 23 2400. Yeah, it looks like the highest price so far was 99.991. So, it got really close. Yeah, platinum looks fine. It It looks like maybe it's following silver. Why is oil rally bearish for metals? Surely it's worse for stocks and crypto. Yeah, it is. It's worse for for everything. But that's why I'm saying when oil rallies, it usually means the top for metals is close. But then the reason there's no rotation from metals in the risk assets like stocks and crypto is because people are then worried about other things like oil rallying. So, I do not expect a massive rotation from metals to crypto. I think crypto might bottom whenever metals bottom, but metals haven't stopped going up yet. So, we can't even talk about crypto bottoming until metals actually start going down. But until that happens, you I'm just trying to ride the bull market in metals for as long as possible. You know, that's what I'm trying to do. trying to ride the metal bull market for as long as possible because when the metal bull market's over, it's likely over everywhere else for a little while, too. It's just a part of the cycle when I can't control it. You can't control it. There's not a single person who control any of this stuff. You just got to get used to it. You you you live in the moment. You um you respect the different phases of the cycle. You don't try to manufacture a different thing. It's likely not going to happen, right? just respect the cycle and and know that, you know, it's it's metals time and and when the time for metals is over, probably within the next two or few months, for a little while, uh then it doesn't mean there's a rotation. It it it likely means that the other stuff goes down as metals go down too. And then when metal is bottom, hopefully like later this year after some type of short-term blow off top in the first half of the year, then I think uh you can maybe have uh more interest in in crypto. But we're not we're not there yet. All right, we're at 999. We are at 999. Let's see if we can get through 100 silver to TLT. The issue with TLT is it's likely going to go back down into the low 80s. So I I I would I would stay bearish on TLT right now. 9993. We still have not yet seen 100. 9994. What about your opinion on all coins? Where's the bottom for all? I I I I've been out of alts for like four or five years other than Ethereum. Um I would say I I would look I would expect them to bleed for most of 2026 is what I expect. I don't control the market guys. I just that's just what I think is going to happen to alt. Someone says bearish divergence in every time frame for silver. Yeah, it's true. Um but the problem is that you know despite the fact that we are seeing that like you you could have you could have started noticing that like long ago but yet silver just continued to go up and to the right. Yeah. Bitcoin dominance also showed bearish divergence on on it on the weekly for for years but it continued to go higher. be like RSI is a good indicator for confluence, but it's not a great indicator by itself because RSI can put in lower highs and lower lows for years even while the underlying metric goes higher. So, it's not the best indicator for trying to like time entries and exits out of the market. nickel next in line. You know, I was actually pretty vocally bullish on nickel in ITC premium uh right before it broke out. Actually, we were we were going through the metals and people like, well, if I if I don't want to buy if they don't want to buy gold, silver, what's the next one to rally? And I think we said nickel right here before it broke out. And it's up a lot since then. The problem though is that even though it's up a lot, it's still bleeding against silver, right? Like it's still going down against silver. So like it goes to show you like why from like an emotional standpoint, people would have rather buy nickel than silver at the time because nickel was already or sorry, silver was already parabolic. But since then, nickel while it's gone up, it actually still has underperformed silver. It's just one of those crazy things where like everyone wants to be a hero and buy the thing that's not doing well, but then the thing that's not doing well continues to bleed to the thing that is 9996. Let's see if we can hit a $100 silver 9994. We keep getting close. Maybe it has hit 100 on on some of the different tickers. I don't know. We're getting close. Someone says, \"Strending view showed 100 on XAGUSD a few minutes ago.\" Uh, yeah. Like I'm just on it. It probably is in a different ticker. That's what I'm saying. Like you probably It probably did hit it on on some of the tickers. It just hasn't done it on the one I was I was currently uh looking at. But it looks like it just did. Looks like it just hit 100. There we go. You guys saw that, right? We just hit 100. I'm trying to capture it, but there we go. All right. I got to tweet it out, of course. All right, we we got it. We got 100 silver. The next big thing will be 5k gold. This is the bigger one. This is the bigger one. Five 5k gold is the is the more difficult one. Hopefully hopefully gold can can make this move. I got to go in about 10 minutes, but we have until then. Um, if you're new here, make sure you guys subscribe, give the video, like the video if you haven't yet. Yeah, silver is silver's now just hovering right above 100. Look at that. Right into the garage. right into the garage. Maybe it'll go out the chimney uh next week. Pretty big accomplishment for silver, honestly. And when you when you zoom out on the silver chart, like it's insane. I mean, it's insane. Absolutely insane. Metal mania as they call it. This one says gold top in 2011 marked the bottom in stocks. Yeah. But there's a nuance to that, right? like when you say so when gold topped in 2011 it marked like this bottom right it marked this bottom but the argument that I've tried to make is that like I don't think we're there right now like I like I think we might be approaching um you know one of these type moves where we're not we're not quite there yet. Now, listen listen. If stocks start to really drop before gold drops, then I I I might start to consider that view, but stocks haven't even really started dropping yet, right? Like, they're still basically at all-time highs. So, it's hard to believe that stocks will bottom when gold tops when stocks haven't even been dropping, right? Like, I mean, how can we say it's a bottom when they're still at, you know, essentially at all-time highs? Silver's back below 100. I might go ahead and get going now because we we did at least get $100 on here. I'm not really sure if gold's going to get through 5K on this first attempt or not. Hopefully, it does, but uh we've seen we've seen plenty of things struggle to get through that 5,000 mark or some, you know, some variation of it. Ideally, it does, but I, you know, if it does, then it really opens the door for some of these other metals. One thing that could happen is maybe gold stalls out a little bit at 5K and allows other metals like palladium and uranium and lithium to run for a little bit. I could see something like that happening. We've seen that with crypto before as well where like Bitcoin gets below a level, it's hard to break through and then while it's consolidating under it, other things are going up that don't have those same resistance levels. So, you might see something like that happen. Um, but anyways guys, thank you for tuning in here. Make sure you subscribe if you're not subscribed.
