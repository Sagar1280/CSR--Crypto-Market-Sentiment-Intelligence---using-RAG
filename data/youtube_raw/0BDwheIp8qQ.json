  "transcript": "This video is for information and entertainment \nonly. It reflects my personal opinions and is   not financial advice. Check the description for \nmore information. Always do your own research.   Hey guys, what is up? Welcome back to the channel. \nI hope you had an excellent Christmas. I hope you   have been enjoying some time off with your friends \nand your family. Today we are looking at Bitcoin   and we are looking at whether or not Bitcoin \nprice today is relatively fair value or not.   And so what we are looking at here is a regression \nchannel, okay? A logarithmic regression channel.   And what this tells you is based upon historical \ndata, what price today is Bitcoin relative to its   history? Is it undervalued relative to history? \nIs it overvalued relative to history? And this   guy who built this, it is a pretty cool thing. \nYou can see what he said here. Bitcoin has been   moving between the green and the blue zones for \nover 2 years. These two zones here. It has never   done that before. And so far, this bull market \nhas been the most stable bull market ever. We   have known this bull market has been a little \nbit different to previous bull markets. I know   \"this time is different\" is obviously blasphemy. \nHowever, this time actually has been different. I   am going to go into some exact reasons as to why \nthat is, but you can see it in the charts really.   This time has been like a step function. Previous \nbull markets have been aggressive sort of like   euphoria blow-off top phases. So, we have just had \nsteady accumulation, no fear, just steady growth.   Right? This chart is that same thing there, the \nlogarithmic regression channel of Bitcoin. And   what you can see is that we have been trading in \nthis green and blue zone all cycle apart from the   FTX lows. This is not that normal. Normally we see \nBitcoin push towards the upper sides or the upper   bands of this logarithmic channel. And what this \ntells you is look, this is the sort of like first   real cycle in 2013. It hit the top side of this \nregression channel. The second cycle hit the top   side too. Actually poked past it a little bit. But \n2021 we did not hit that top side. And this cycle,   we have barely even touched above this blue line \nhere. And what this blue line is, the top of the   blue line is 85% of the time, Bitcoin is less \nthan this value in terms of its relative price.   When Bitcoin is in the blue and the green zones, \nfor the most part, it is pretty much fair value,   especially this sort of like the band between \nthe green and the blue. The lower end of the   green band, Bitcoin is relatively cheap. The upper \nend of the blue band, well, Bitcoin is relatively   expensive. If you like average out Bitcoin \nhistory, actually it spends a lot of time in this   kind of like green band, especially during bear \nmarkets. This cycle has not been a bear market.   Obviously, Bitcoin has gone from $16,000 all the \nway to $126,000. I mean, it has had a massive,   massive run, a massive accumulation in price. \nYes, the last year has not really gone anywhere.   Actually, fact, Bitcoin has gone down within the \nlast year. But relative to this chart, Bitcoin   right now is fair value. It is well within the \nsort of range you would expect to find it most of   the time. Now, this does not mean Bitcoin cannot \ngo down from here. My base case actually is that   probably we do see more downside pressure, but \nthis is to say that look, there is nothing that is   going to force Bitcoin into these upper echelon \nbands. And actual fact, as more time goes on,   Bitcoin is less and less likely to hit the upper \nechelons of these returns because as it gets   larger, as the asset grows in price, obviously it \nis going to take more and more money to move it.   As the asset gets more adoption, it is just going \nto see a reduced amount of volatility like we have   seen all year. If we look at the volatility this \ncycle, it is massively reduced relative to last   cycle as well. So, I just want to be cautious \nwhen people are comparing Bitcoin to the S&P,   Bitcoin to gold for example, all these comparisons \nof Bitcoin against other things and then saying,   \"Look, Bitcoin needs to catch up.\" Look, Bitcoin \nactually relative to its history, its own history,   is relatively fair value right now. And if we look \nat Bitcoin relative to global liquidity, we have   seen lots of charts looking at global liquidity \nin the past. This one is pretty cool. All it shows   you is look, Bitcoin normally trends with global \nliquidity. It goes a little bit ahead of global   liquidity sometimes. Sometimes it lags global \nliquidity, but on the whole it moves with global   liquidity. You can see this chart down here with \nthe clouds around Bitcoin price. Global liquidity   gradually goes up. Bitcoin gradually goes up with \nit. Sometimes it is above this sort of like green   line here. Sometimes it is below. Generally, you \nknow, it is above, right? And especially this   cycle, generally it has been above. What this \nchart is saying is look, there are times when   Bitcoin is leading global liquidity. There are \ntimes when it is lagging global liquidity, but   generally it trends pretty much in line with it. \nIt is a macro asset. When there is more liquidity,   Bitcoin tends to trend with the trend. However, we \nhave seen this disconnect here. Look at this white   line, which is the Bitcoin price has disconnected \nhere, and we are now trading in the lower ends of   these regression bands. And what does it tell \nyou? Well, basically, if you look at this top   chart up here, it shows a little bit clearer. \nThis is the global liquidity index, but just as   an oscillator. And all it tells you is, look, \nwhen Bitcoin is leading global liquidity, this   white line is above zero. When it is lagging, this \nwhite line is beneath zero. And actually right   now we are right on this lower end. So we are two \nstandard deviations away from the mean. And what   this tells you is look, Bitcoin is rarely in this \nposition. It has been in this position six times   since 2015 or six times in history pretty much. \nIt is rarely this decoupled from global liquidity.   So there is absolutely a situation right now where \nBitcoin is lagging recently. The S&P lagging gold,   lagging silver, etc. People have been saying \nit was the October 10th that was the thing that   disconnected the market. But this disconnect of \nglobal liquidity actually happened before October   10th. It was not just an October 10th thing. \nGlobal liquidity was expanding and Bitcoin was   not really following it. Then it started to come \ndown whilst global liquidity continued to expand.   These are very, very long-term charts though. This \nis a 12-year chart. It is definitely not something   that is going to happen and correct tomorrow. But \nas a result of this disconnect, what we are seeing   is that people are saying this all-time high was \nnot like the others. Therefore, Bitcoin must catch   up. It must go up. The bull market is not over. \nThis chart just shows you cycle high performance.   So each of these lines is a cycle of Bitcoin. \nThis is 2013. The red one is 2017. The blue   one is 2021. And the black one is this cycle. And \nyou can see this cycle actually Bitcoin has done   relatively poor especially versus other cycles. \nThis is like what 40x here, 20x here, you know, 6x   here. And this is from all-time high to the next \nall-time high. Obviously the bigger Bitcoin gets,   the lower those highs are going to be because \nwe have just got diminishing returns. That has   to happen. Otherwise, Bitcoin will be, you know, \na quadrillion dollar asset. This is the sort of   thing we are seeing a lot of like Bitcoin must \ncatch up because it is undervalued because it   has not done what it did last cycle because it \nis lagging against other indices, other global   assets. This is where I think arguably in the \nshort term, especially not really necessarily very   true. These are massively long-term trends. And if \nwe zoom out, right, Bitcoin is being compared to   gold. This I showed you a logarithmic regression \nchannel earlier. This one actually takes gold   rather than dollars as the denominator. Right? So \nthe thing that Bitcoin is being priced in is gold   ounces as opposed to dollars. And you can see \nwe saw it when we were comparing it to dollars.   Bitcoin was relatively fair value. It was in \nthis green zone. But against gold, Bitcoin is   aggressively undervalued here supposedly because \nwe are in this gray zone. And actually this guy   is not saying that we should use this model to \nperfectly decide what the good value of Bitcoin   is. But I have seen this model spread around in a \nfew other places saying look Bitcoin is massively   undervalued against gold. Therefore it must catch \nup. Just quickly guys I want to tell you about   Easy Bitcoin. This segment is sponsored by Easy \nBitcoin. They are part of the Easy Group family   and Easy Bitcoin operate a recurring purchase \nservice for Bitcoin. The service functions through   scheduled card payments at user-defined intervals. \nUpon processing payment, the company purchased   Bitcoin and transfers it to a user's specified \naddress. The service operates in non-custodial   basis, meaning purchase Bitcoin is sent directly \nto the user's controlled wallet without being held   on the platform. This means users can choose how \nmuch they want to DCA, how frequently they want   to DCA, and it is never held by Easy Bitcoin. \nIt is always held in the user's own wallet.   Easy Bitcoin is not available in the UK and this \ninformation is provided for educational purposes   only and does not constitute financial advice \nor a promotion. Cryptocurrency investments carry   significant risks including total loss of capital. \nAlways do your own research. Thank you so much to   Easy Bitcoin for sponsoring this portion of the \nvideo. One thing that is important to sort of   like grasp here is gold was basically flat for \nthe 12-year period whilst Bitcoin was ripping.   Let me just show you this. What you can see is \nthat when Bitcoin is compared against gold, yes,   obviously Bitcoin right now against gold in all of \nBitcoin history, it looks incredibly good value.   We just saw that regression chart, but this is \nbecause those charts when you compare all history,   what are they looking at? Gold had a completely \nridiculously terrible 10 or 12 year period. Just   look at this. Gold did not break above this level \nfor I mean, I think it is 12 years. Look at this.   We measure from here all the way to when gold \nactually begins to break above and it is 4,500   days. Yeah, it is like 12 years. Absolutely crazy. \nSo, when we are looking at Bitcoin against gold,   you have to remember that gold was basically flat \nfor an entire period. So, of course, because gold   has gone up aggressively since the middle of \n2023. Yes, it has gone up too quite a lot since   that period, but especially within the last year, \ngold has done 70%. Bitcoin has done, you know,   minus 10%. It looks like a massive disconnect, but \nreally this elastic band was pulled aggressively   into negative territory for gold already. Now, \npersonally, I think Bitcoin is going to catch up,   but I really, really, really, really do not \nthink it is going to be something that happens   immediately, especially in the short term. The \nidea that this is now done, I just think is like,   well, why is it done now? There has got to be \na good reason for it to just just be done now.   And so, from here, if we come back to just \nthe Bitcoin chart, I think there is a very,   very good reason to believe this all-time high \nfrom 2021, which has never been tested. It is   very likely to be tested. Blue line is the 50-week \nmoving average, and the sort of golden line is the   200-week moving average. Every time Bitcoin closes \nunderneath the 50-week, it generally signals the   end of a bull market. Now, this probably is not \nnecessarily news to you, but look, Bitcoin closes   underneath the 50-week here, goes much, much \nlower afterwards. Bitcoin closes underneath the   50-week here, again, goes much lower afterwards. \nBitcoin again closes underneath the 50-week here.   This is the end of the 2013 bull market. Closed \nunderneath there and again, it comes much much   lower. What you tend to find is that Bitcoin finds \nsupport around the 200-week moving average. Find   support on the 200-week after closing below. Find \nsupport on the 200-week after coming below again.   It retests the under. This is 2021. What happened? \nIt came, closed underneath, retested, came all the   way back down. It actually lost the 200-week \nin 2021, which is quite unlikely. Obviously,   this was the FTX situation, the Luna situation, \njust sent Bitcoin to all hell. And right now,   the 200-week moving average is all the way down \nat 56K. So, it is not even that low. And if you   think like high to low, that is only 55% down from \nthe all-time high. It is really quite reasonable   when you think about it. And actually, if we put \na line of best fit on here, this trend line here   basically sort of like mimics the way the moving \naverage was going. This is my base case. Actually,   we at least test the old all-time high at sort \nof like, you know, 69Kish, 65 to 69K. I think   this region basically has to be tested just from \na technical perspective. It has never been tested   so far. This moving average will probably hit this \nkind of area around March of next year. You know,   call it between sort of like end of Q1, start \nof Q2. In that sort of region, there is going   to be a new Fed chair by then. Our market is \ngoing to front-run that. But to be honest,   my base case of what I think happens is we are \nright here right now. We retest the underside of   this 50-week at least. Maybe we break a little bit \nabove it. But as long as there are no closures,   there are no weekly closures and open and close \nabove this level, then I think we just come down.   We test this area. I think that is enough for a \nnew cycle to begin for Bitcoin overall. Whether   you want to call it cycles, whether you want it \nto be liquidity, Bitcoin is in a downtrend. It   has been in a downtrend. Unless it can get above \nthis old wick high here like 107K, it is going to   remain pressured to the downside. I think looking \nat all these charts comparing Bitcoin to silver,   Bitcoin to gold, Bitcoin to the S&P, whilst they \nall provide a compelling reason for Bitcoin to   be catching up, I just do not see the catch-up \ntrade happening immediately. And look, Bitcoin   is massively decoupled in terms of its performance \nagainst basically every other asset, right? This   is Bitcoin against silver. I mean, it has been \naggressively beaten by silver. Bitcoin against   the NASDAQ. It has been absolutely destroyed \nagainst the NASDAQ since the start of July.   Bitcoin is down 37% against the NASDAQ. Obviously, \nthe NASDAQ has been ripping against gold. Since   the end of last year, Bitcoin is down 52% against \ngold and against silver. Just this year, Bitcoin   is down 65% against gold just this year. And since \nthe end of last year, Bitcoin is down 67% against   silver. Data across crypto is not looking great. \nThis is 7-day exchange volume. Look at this for a   perfect chart of lower highs and lower lows. High, \nlower high, lower high, lower high, lower high,   lower high. Looked like it was going to reverse \nhere, but no. Lower high, lower high, lower high.   This is a chart of total daily exchange volume. \nThat is telling you how many people are trading   these things in crypto. Nowhere near as many as in \n2021. Not even close to as many as 2021. Despite   the fact we have had stablecoin adoption, \ndespite the fact we have got RWAs on-chain,   despite the fact we have got regulatory \nbackdrop improving, Clarity Act coming soon,   blah blah blah. It has not pushed more people to \ncome and use crypto. Has not pushed more people   on-chain. Crypto is actively missing a large \nnumber of its users. The question is quite simple.   Is the world becoming more or less financialized? \nAre people getting more or less trust in their   governments? Are more and more things being put \nonto blockchain rails? I mean, it is very clear   the answer to these questions is yes. There is \nmore adoption coming. More things are going to   be put on financial rails. More people have an \ninterest in finance. It is clear that in 5 years,   at least to me, crypto is going to be a core piece \nof infrastructure that underpins basically all of   finance. I do not doubt that. But in the shorter \nterm, I am very much convinced prices are coming   lower, and I am quite happy about that, to be \nhonest. Finally, guys, just a massive shout out   to the channel sponsor, Uphold. Uphold is a wicked \nexchange with deep liquidity. They actually made   the Forbes best list in 2024. And the main reason \nI like them is because you can get this card,   and if you are in crypto, you will know how \npainful it can be turning assets on-chain   into money in your bank. Being able to spend it \ndirectly has been incredibly convenient for me.   This is not intended for UK audience. Crypto \nis a high-risk investment. You could lose all   your money and you should not expect protection \nif something goes wrong. Thank you very much to   Uphold for sponsoring this portion of the video. \nI am happy if Bitcoin just does 20% annually per   year and I am able to accumulate it in the 80K \nregion, 70K region, 60K region, whatever. Even   if it goes down as far as 40K, 50K, to me it would \nactually be a good thing. I know it would cause a   lot of pain along the way, but anyway, thank you \never so much for watching, guys. I hope you had   an excellent Christmas. Hope you have a great time \nwith your family. I shall see you in the next one.",
