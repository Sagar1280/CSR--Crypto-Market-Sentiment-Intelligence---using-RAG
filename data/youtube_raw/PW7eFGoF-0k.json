  "transcript": "I'd rather have no bill than a bad bill. >> The biggest piece of crypto legislation in history, this would regulate crypto has failed. >> Obviously, in your tweet last night, you laid out what your concerns are with the bill. Uh too many restrictions on rewards, not enough uh CFTC oversight here. You mentioned issues with the DeFi space. I won't rehash all of it, but you've been working with lawmakers so closely on this. Why did it all fall apart at the 11th hour? The Senate Banking Committee postpones their vote on the crypto market structure legislation. This is something Congress has been working on for over a year. Postpones their vote amid industry push back after reviewing the Senate banking draft text over the last 48 hours. Coinbase unfortunately can't support the bill as written. You know, we got to see the draft text on Monday night and about 36 hours later as our we were looking through it, we started to notice some issues in the bill and we developed this concern that if it went into a markup um the only way to edit some of that base text would have been through an amendments and the amendments had already been submitted and so we didn't think it was prudent to have it come out of committee with a bunch of these issues in the bill which would have been catastrophic I think for the average American consumer and so we decided to voice our opinion about the current state of the text and uh without commenting on procedurally whether the markup should happen or not, I'll defer to the Senate on that. And so I think we've got a chance to do a new draft and hopefully get back into a markup in a few weeks. >> And once you understand why, you'll get it. There are too many issues, including a de facto ban on tokenized equities that directly goes against what the SEC is aiming to do. >> Are the major banks and the brokers out there today moving increasingly toward tokenization? Oh, absolutely. >> Tokenize the stock market, tokenize, bring it all on chain. Traditional finance, decentralized finance prohibitions, giving the government unlimited access to your financial records, and removing your right to privacy. Obviously, that's a deal breaker. We're not going to let the government get de facto ownership of our data. Erosion of the CFTC's authority, stifling innovation, and making it subservient to the SEC. And then of course the big one with the big banks have been non-stop fighting over which are draft amendments that would kill rewards on stable coins allowing banks to ban their competition. The banks are not doing this in secret anymore. This is out in the open. They're this is a direct quote from Brian Moahan CEO of Bank of America. He says, but the point we've tried to make and if you look at some studies, I think that were done by the Treasury is that they say you can see upwards of $6 trillion in deposits flow off the liabilities of a banking system to the as the deposits into the stable coin environment. The Bank of America CEO literally says if this Clarity Act passes like Brian Armstrong and the tech people, the crypto people wanted to, $6 trillion upwards of that will flow from the banks into Ethereum into Solana into the stable coin environment. And the Coinbase CEO reveals live on CNBC that the banks are trying to kill crypto and the market structure bill. We can't really have uh banks come in and try to kill their competition at the expense of the American consumer, right? People in America should be able to earn more money on their money. Um I think stable coins are an opportunity for banks. They should be able to build great product lines with this. It's an opportunity for crypto companies. Uh you know, Congress and the laws that get passed, they should really create a level playing field and say this is allowed, this is not allowed. Now all American companies go compete, try to build the best products and services. That's great. What's not great is if the banks uh can put their thumb on the scale to try to kill some of their competition. I >> mean, what would you say to the argument that banks have put forward that because of the role they play in the economy, the loans that they make, if they do wind up seeing billions of dollars, as some have estimated would happen going from banks to stable coin. They say that could have a big impact on the economy. What's your response to that? >> Yeah, well, banks don't have a monopoly on lending money. Actually, crypto is doing quite well in this area as well. And crypto is a technology to update all parts of the financial system whether it's lending, capital formation, um, etc. So, um, I think banks do play an important role in the economy and making these loans. Um, crypto should be allowed to do similar types of activity. Um, we're not engaged in fractional reserve lending. That's an important point, by the way, because the bank license, what that really allows you to do is fractional reserve. The banks don't have all of your money there. That's why there's so much oversight and you can have these runs on the bank. stable coins have a 100% reserve, right? And they're all all the assets now postgenius are held in this short-term US treasuries. So, in my view, it's actually a safer uh place to store your money. And um crypto companies should be allowed to compete and offer loans just just like banks. >> And time's running out. The banks understand they don't have to win this fight. They just have to delay the fight so no change can happen and they remain in power. They the status quo remains. Lawmakers there are pledging to keep working, but let's be clear on the timeline. Time is very much running out. Even if the committee were able to approve this bill in the next month and rehold this vote, it still needs to be combined with other pieces, passed in the full Senate, be negotiated with the House, and potentially passed both chambers again. That is going to take months at the very least. >> Now, anybody trading this market on exchange partner Coin W, special opportunity for you. We're going to go up to futures, of course. Switch this over to Ethereum BTC Ethereum. And is there anything that could catalyze if you're in a long position or short position? Is there a next catalyst that could affect the Ethereum price? Well, Mr. Beast eyes defy as Tom Lee's Ethereum treasury company Bitmine. >> Ethereum treasury company Bitmine is partnering uh with a YouTube powerhouse making a $200 million investment in Mr. Beast's company, Beast Industries. There's a lot of strategic rationale to this move made by Bitmine. Um, as you know, Bitmine is the largest Ethereum treasury company in the world. Uh, the largest holder of Ethereum and it's our view that Ethereum, which is a smart contract platform, is the future of finance where digitalization of not only dollars but stocks and equities is going to take place and over time that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money. Um, and that's where uh a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense. >> Now, unfortunately, both Bit stock, which owns a lot of Ethereum, and the Ethereum price itself tanked on the news. It just couldn't compete with the Clarity Act setback news, but how this may affect Ethereum. And we'll get to the opportunity for you. How Mr. Beast is delving further into Ethereum. >> Mr. Beast is the number one content creator in the world. His content is watched more than for each of his videos 252 million views a month which is more than the Super Bowl and really he is probably the iconic person for Gen Z, Gen Alpha and arguably millennials. So he is probably one of the most important creators in the world. Uh Beast Industries according to Jeff Henbold is planning to create a future platform of services which includes digital items and even financial services and that's really where a collaboration between Beast Industries and Bitmine will make sense.

This is at least what I'm doing. I wanted to share with you. Follow along down below. And personally, I think this collab is bullish. Some people have pushed back and said, \"Tom, I thought you were trying to accumulate 5% of the Ethereum supply, but then you put this amount of money investing in Beast Industries.\" >> Tom, someone wants to know, \"You haven't reached 5% yet on Ethereum and you're making this weird investment in their view. Uh, can we can they trust your strategy for BitMine?\" >> Uh, hopefully that investor tunes into our stockholders meeting today, which we are streaming from Las Vegas. uh there we're going to unveil our 2026 strategy for Bitine which has four pillars of growth. Um you know one of them of course is getting to 5% of Ethereum and optimizing the yield but it's going to be natural for Bitmine to also productize its platform. So working with Beast Industries and Beast is a way for us to productize the the huge community of Bit. >> And finally looking at lower cap altcoins. I thought this was huge. Raul Pal on Real Vision saying Barry Silbert who is a billionaire very accomplished. He says Barry Silbert is going to be right. Tao is going up. Now we can go over to the charts. Look at the TOA price. See it's still in this consolidation zone. I do think it's interesting to see the TOA flowing to all the subnets at a glance. This is bullish. Basically this just shows the health of the subnets. the liquidity for the subnets, the flow which is in the green, which all now gives us some insight on why Raul pal to his real vision audience just said this >> to Julian about this over the weekend writing GMI. It's like Barry Silva's going to be right. Tower is going to go up. Bit tenser. It's really annoying because I've known Barry forever and he always gets these things right. Um you know he got the Zcash one as well. Um and I just think Bit Tense if I look at the weekly chart it's like it's a killer chart. I don't own any. In fact, let me show you the chart. Uh let me see if I can find >> I've been in and out of town several times. Um they had their haring uh in >> That's right. >> down, but it always has this nice bottom to it around this sort of level. >> I mean, it's just a >> so tow is like a rewards mechanism for these AI. So like if you're talking about what we just spoke about with the how to train these models better, that is essentially what they're trying to do here. >> Yeah. I mean I mean that's a very clean kind of big flag pattern and if it's going to happen there's a big price move to come. So you know I've been following this one with interest and then trying to keep open to the AI trade. >> If you've made it this far in today's video please do me a huge favor. Click subscribe.
