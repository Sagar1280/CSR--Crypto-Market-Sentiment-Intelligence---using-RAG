  "transcript": "Yo, welcome everyone. It is unfortunately getting worse. Bitcoin is dropping even lower. And today I'm going to show you my exact major price targets that you probably will not like. Now, first you're going to see on the 12-hour time frame, Bitcoin is right now still trading in some kind of an asni triangle. Yes, we got a fake out only a few days ago, but the thing is we then got a rejection exactly at our major golden Fibonacci ratio and so far we are getting accepted once again back below our area of support. Also remember the trend line area of resistance we talked about yesterday. We were connecting our higher lows and at least as of right now it looks like Bitcoin is breaking our first trend line area of support back towards upside. However, the support level of the SN triangle, the trend line right here is going to come in slightly lower at approximately $90,000. And so far it does look like the triangle is not really getting broken towards the downside. what is going to be the exact price target looking right now at this specific triangle and of course also later I want to show you even more important targets with trendbased Fibonacci extension but the thing is let's try to measure the opening of our triangle from the top right here back towards the bottom putting the trend line on the potential breakdown that might happen in the upcoming days and you can right now see that the target is going to be definitely below our recent low at approximately 78,000 US area. We are going to come back towards this exact target slightly later. But right now, let's go and talk about even more important levels which are going to be the bonacci extensions. Why we are going to talk about them? Simply because as you probably know for the past few weeks, we have been paying attention to the bigger fivewave price structure towards our side. We have been identifying the first impulse right here. We got a correction, another impulsive wave right here, another correction. and write the Bitcoin simply. If we go lower, start breaking our SA triangle towards upside, we are probably then forming our fifth final push down before a bigger bounce towards the upside before a bigger reversal is potentially going to happen. Also, right now when we are zooming in, let's just say on the 1 hour time frame right here, we can also talk about another fivewave price structure. What we can say, Bitcoin completed the first impulse right here. We got a correction. Right now we are probably working on the third elite wave because simply this entire push towards downside it looks really really impulsive. That is why we might be forming the third one, the fourth one and only after the fifth one is going to finished we might be expecting a bigger reversal back up. So far I do remain in all of my short trades. I am right now still in a short trade on Bitcoin from approximately $97,400. what you're actually going to right here see with this specific short the entry was almost exactly at the top right here simply because I was measuring the entire push down looking towards this specific golden Fibonacci ratio we came in towards our golden Fibonacci ratio where of course we were looking to fire another short trade and I did share with you the exact scenario I'm looking for already slightly before in my free VIP Discord group of course as you probably know already right here. Let's just say on 7th of January, I posted this remains the best trading setup. I didn't know that it's actually going to play out. But the thing is, I made the plan. I traded the plan. We hit the gold pocket right here. No emotions. Fired a brand new trade right here. And right now, the trade on Bitcoin, on Ethereum, on XRP, and also on Solana are being in a beautiful profit. Yes. Also, right now, I closed all of my long trades on Bitcoin and also on XRP. looking potentially for much lower price targets in the upcoming days. And probably right now you're wondering what is going to be the price target if Bitcoin right does drop lower because yes the target of our triangle right here if you look like that is going to be at 78,500. However, what are going to be the price targets of our bigger fivewave price structure right here? We go with our Fibonacci extension. We are going to go exactly from the alltime high back towards the low back towards our fourth alien wave. what you can right or see the most important target is going to be our one one coming in at approximately 74,000 if we do go with the lock scale the target is going to be slightly higher at $79,400 and you can actually right here see that it is almost exactly aligning with the price target of our SN triangle so it really does look like if we start breaking the triangle back down bearish indication we are probably even looking for another lower low right here and also right here the major Fibonacci extent financial level is also going to be slightly below the low at $79,400. And this is right now also why I would really appreciate if you smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible. And of course also thank you for subscribing to the channel right now. Let's also talk about our volume levels and also what is going to be the best support area right now on the entire Bitcoin chart. First of all, what we are actually going to do, remember the support area we were mentioning yesterday? What we were doing? Let's go right now with our high time frame support levels where you can rightly see Bitcoin only a few hours ago hit our weekly high time frame support level literally almost to the exact dollar accuracy. This weekly support level right here is actually a brand new high time frame support level that was formed on Monday only one day ago. Also right now measuring the entire bottom price action with the volume. What you can write to see the point of control or the biggest volume cluster was also hit only a few hours ago. So currently what we can see sure bitcoin is trading at some kind of an area of support. Would I personally go with a new long trade right here? To be honest, not really. Simply because of the volume theory we already talked about yesterday. Remember what we said. If we do get the acceptance below our value area high, it could be a bearish Bitcoin indication. And technically speaking, or should I say theoretically speaking, we are looking for a rotation back towards our value area low at approximately $87,000. And yes, trust me, this specific value area right here is really a very important and a significant price target for Bitcoin. more about it slightly later. But right now, very very simply in terms of the theory of our volume, if we do get the acceptance below the value area high, we could be looking towards our value area low. And usually this right here is happening very very nicely. Acceptance above the value area low, pushed towards the upside towards the value area high right here. When we got this push down, it did not really play out because clearly we did not go towards our value area low. Bitcoin simply then pumped even higher towards the upside. However, you're going to see right here acceptance below the value area high push down back towards the value area low. So getting right now the acceptance below the value area high right here in my opinion is definitely going to be a bearish Bitcoin indication and that is right now why I would like to share with you two very important liquidity levels you should right to be aware of in a case Bitcoin is going to go even lower back down. So first of all, what you're going to notice at this specific area, Bitcoin has been trading and forming a lot of higher lows and our higher lows are definitely a very important liquidity level. You can write here see the previous low was formed $89,200. Our first liquidity level, our second liquidity level slightly higher because it was a higher low and you can write to see it is going to come in at approximately $89,500. And then another liquidity level just slightly higher $90,000 exactly. Additionally, what we are going to do, let's go with the anchored VWAP and let's anchor it exactly at the low right here of this entire move towards the upside. What you can write to see the level is coming in exactly at our major liquidity cluster. So definitely what we can write to say if Bitcoin does go lower, we for sure do have a beautiful support level exactly at $90,000 with the anchored VWAP and of course also with our liquidity levels. However, right now I want to share with you the best support level on the entire Bitcoin chart. Maybe even if we are going to hit the support level right here, I am going to be taking some profits on my Bitcoin short trade simply because it's actually quite a significant area of support. And we are once again going to talk about our liquidity levels because the reality is liquidity is usually one of the best area you should always target. Pay right now attention exactly to this specific part of the chart at approximately $86,500. Pretty much the exact same story as we were getting exactly at this specific level. We have a lot of higher lows. First liquidity level right here. Second liquidity level right here. Third liquidity level right here. And also the fourth liquidity level. approximately $86,000 $87,000 clearly it is going to be a major liquidity level for Bitcoin also right now what is the most important Fibonacci ratio we should always pay attention to and of course also the one where Bitcoin is right of getting a rejection off of course the golden Fibonacci ratio let's write a go with our Fibonacci retracement from our swing low back towards the swing high and you can right now definitely see that our golden Fibonacci ratio coming in exactly at our liquidity level. Additionally, we go with our volume measuring the entire bottom price action with volume. The value area low surprisingly or maybe not coming in exactly right here. So, I would say like that the best level you can write on target with your short trade is first of all going to be this specific zone. If broken down for sure, we are looking for a bigger fifth all wave to come in and of course for us to form another lower low in the upcoming weeks.

Also pay attention to the Bitcoin liquidation heat map on the oneweek time frame right now on the push down. Of course, as we were saying for the past few days, pay attention to the first liquidation cluster below our recent lows at approximately $91,000. And right now, clearly liquidation cluster is getting hit beautifully. Yes, on the push down right here, we haven't really gotten that many liquidations. Only approximately 300 million of longs have gotten liquidated in the past 24 hours. But the reality right now is the lower we are going to go more long positions are going to get wrecked. And right now the next biggest liquidation cluster is going to be visible on the twoe time frame. So what if we are right now zooming out? What you're actually going to see right here is that the biggest liquidations cluster if we are going to drop lower is definitely going to get hit below our recent lows at approximately let's just say $89,000. As we said before, $89,000 US area for Bitcoin is going to be another important support level. Not only because of our liquidations right here, but also because clearly we do have our recent lows right here. And also, as we said before, the anchored VWAP is going to come in exactly at this specific area. So, yes, another support level if we are going to drop lower is going to be just slightly lower. But the reality is the best level I'm right now paying attention to is definitely still going to be the gold pocket. the value area low and also the major liquidity cluster at approximately $86,500 US area right here on the Bitcoin chart. Also, right now, what if Bitcoin is not going to go lower and maybe even we are going to get another major push up? What if everything I talked about right now is going to be completely wrong and Bitcoin is simply going to pump significantly higher? In this scenario, I'm only paying attention to three very important levels. We are again going to go with our volume where you can right now see the value area high coming in at $93,200. Additionally, what we can be doing right here because Bitcoin formed a brand new lower high only a few days ago, we can talk about another trend line area of resistance. So, we can be connecting our lower highs with a trend line. And this level, of course, if we are right, are going to get a push toward the upside is probably going to align beautifully with the value area high. Additionally, we are going to go with another anchored VWAP and anchor it exactly at this specific high where we can write to see the anchored VWAP. At least as of right now, it is aligning perfectly also with our trend line area of resistance. what we can write to say when potentially we actually want to close our short trades if Bitcoin is going to get a sign of strength. Very very simply reclaiming the value area high breaking our trend line breaking our anchored VWAP is definitely a major bullish Bitcoin indication until this right here is going to happen. Unfortunately, we definitely need to look for lower targets and ideally as we said the best support level right here is going to be below our recent lows at approximately 86,500. However, the better target in terms of our alien wave count is definitely going to be much lower below 80, maybe even below $75,000 US area. Yes, for sure some people really like paying attention to the RSI indicator. And yes, the reality right now is if you go with the RSI on the 4hourly, we are right now reaching the oversold area. Technically speaking, this right here is a bullish indication for Bitcoin. Last time we were in the oversold right here, we got a push towards the upside. Oversold right here. We got a push towards the upside. Oversold right here. We got a push towards the upside. So definitely RSI reaching the oversold area is clearly a bullish Bitcoin indication. But the thing is, as we said, I'm going to get slightly more bullish on Bitcoin only after we do get a sign of strength on the market structure. That being said, reclaiming our value area high, bullish indication. Let's look for much higher targets on Bitcoin. Until this happens, of course, I do remain in my short trades on Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and also Solana looking for our lower targets at least towards the area of 86,500, maybe even much lower for our fifth wave below $80,000.
