  "transcript": "Look at this. Small caps just tagged record highs. Gold, well, it went a little bit lower. And Bitcoin is still staring at the same red line like it's a locked door. So, here's the question that matters. Risk on is spreading across markets. Safe havens are cooling and the fear premium just yanked out of the system. So, does Bitcoin finally reclaim that red line resistance and confirm a fresh uptrend? Or are we walking into the same fake out that's burned people 10 times already? Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen, because in a few minutes, I'm going to give you a simple checklist you can use over the next week to separate a real breakout from another rejection. And there's one crossasset tell that's quietly leading this whole move. And again remember nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. Let's start with the loudest signal in the room. Small caps they are ripping guys. The Russell 2000, which is the index of micro caps and small caps essentially, is sitting [music] around 2,698. And it's up about 8.7% this year already in just 22 days, up 8.7%. That's huge. Earlier push in the highest beta corner of the US equities. When small caps lead, it usually means one thing. risk appetite is moving out of this safe meggaap bunker and into the part of the market that needs confidence and liquidity to survive. This matters for crypto because Bitcoin tends to thrive when financial conditions feel easier. When investors start feeling brave again and when capital stops hiding. Small caps are saying go. Gold just stopped screaming run. We'll see how long that lasts, but at least for now. So, [music] why is Bitcoin still hesitating? Well, hold that thought, guys. Now, let's talk about what happened to the safety trade. Gold and precious metals got smoked today as the market processed easing trade tensions. That's a textbook unwind of defense positioning. Markets had been bracing for a fresh round of US Europe tariff escalation tied to the Greenland saga. But when that pressure released, the fear bid came out of gold. When safe haven stopped absorbing flows, those flows look for a new home. Sometimes it goes to equities, sometimes it goes to crypto, and sometimes it goes into both. So, this is the moment where Bitcoin should start acting like the risk on asset again, which brings us to the catalyst that flipped the switch. So, let's unpack the headline driver without getting lost in the drama. Over the last few days, markets whipped around on tariff threats tied to Greenland negotiations. Then at Davos, the tone changed. European markets rallied after Trump cancelled proposed tariffs against those eight European countries. And guess what? The retaliatory tariffs were also cancelled on the US from Europe. Some of these guys are calling this the taco trade, meaning Trump always chickens out. However, I think this is more strategic. There's a really good post from the Kobesi letter that I'll probably talk about early next week. So, the market heard tariffs canled and hit the risk on button. Yet, the situation still has moving parts and that keeps volatility in the air. For Bitcoin, volatility is fuel. It can also be a trap because when headlines drive the tape, you get wicks, you get stop hunts, you get fake outs. That's why this next part matters more than any single headline. Now, let's zoom out to the macro engine, official inflation, alternative inflation. So, you can feel the tension. One camp sees disinflation and starts chanting rate cuts. Well, by the time you guys watch this, we will have the news on the rate cuts, but Poly Market says it's about a 98% chance that we get no rate changes at all. So, that's been priced in. But the other camp, well, they look hard at activity data and they say slowed down because today's growth data was strong. As we talked about in our previous show, we're expecting to see probably five plus% in GDP and the labor market looks sturdy. It actually the un the lossless jobs loss job losses anyway, they were they came in lower than expected. So what does this mean for Bitcoin? It means the market is trying to price two stories at the same time. Story one, inflation is falling. Policy gets easier and liquidity rises. Story two, growth is strong, the Fed stays patient, risk assets chop sideways. Bitcoin, as do all markets, they hate confusion at resistance. Bitcoin loves clarity after the decision. So the real question becomes simple. Does Bitcoin get acceptance above the red line while the macro story stabilizes or does macro uncertainty keep pressing it back down? Now, the quiet tailwind that keeps showing up in these cycles is money supply is back at record levels right now. That's the M2 supply we talk about on a global and US basis. And on the Treasury side, buybacks are real again. We talked about this in previous shows recently. Also, I'm not saying that buybacks instantly pump Bitcoin. No, no. It's just the direction of the liquidity. Conversation is changing and markets frontr run that risk on doesn't need a tsunami. It starts with just these cracks in the wall that we're seeing right now. So, now let's get to the main event. Bitcoin right now is trading around $89,000 at the time of recording. And technically, this market has a very clean map. There's a big resistance band. Well, there's quite a few of them. one is that 94.5K zone that I said exists uh that we would really need to break and hold above. But then once you get back that there's two more resistance zones that are critical. One is that 976 zone or wherever we hit, you know, the the recent highs and then of course you have the $100,000 mark, which is psychological resistance. So those are your three red lines. I would be super happy if we could just break above 945 and close the weekly candle above that. It would feel to me at that point we've kind of established a new zone. But until then, we're sitting here back here close to that 87,000 mark, which I told you for it seemed like months. It was just hanging out and had a magnet pulled there. So, right now, we're seeing a little range between that high high 87s and the $9,000 psychological level. So, why did we fail to hold that 945 zone? Well, it's because markets have a really hard time when there is fear in the air. And this week, the rest of the market started whispering risk instead of fear. And that's why this attempt has more weight than the last 10. Now, let's layer one more confirmation lens. This is whale behavior. This is important, guys. This look, this is what smart and big money are doing. One report suggests that 1,000 to 10,000 BTC cohorts shifted into accumulation behavior around December and have maintained net buying behavior through the chop. Now, that doesn't guarantee price go up tomorrow, but it tells you a bigger picture. Bigger players and whales are positioning while the crowd argues about these short-term candles. So, here's the tension point. Macro is warming. Risk appetite is broadening. safe havens cooled. Bitcoin is still below that critical line we've talked about. So, now let's get tactical, guys. All right, here's a simple framework. No overthinking, guys. Just check marks. We need to see the daily close above 94.5,000. I'd love to see it on the weekly. And then from there, it finds a new zone, but then we got those important breakout marks above it, which is that 97.5 to $100,000. And if we can clear above then, then we know that we're looking for the next leg higher, potentially back to all-time highs. And one thing I I think is important to mention, guys, is that we have these CME gaps, right? Because the CME is a futures exchange that trades Bitcoin, and on the weekends, it stops trading. So, we have often have these gaps that that for some reason the markets feel they need to be filled. It to me, it seems like a little bit of, you know, crypto bro astrology, but it's not. 97% of these CME gaps get filled and there's another one right now sitting at 93k zone. So, you know, likely in the next week or two, we're likely to head back and hit that 93,000 mark. Let's hope that is on the path to much higher. Some folks say that the reason that we came back down to this 88k zone is because there was a CME gap and it was filled and now we can move higher. So, let's see what happens moving forward with those things in mind. And of course, another strong signal was the Russell 2000. If we keep seeing the Russell 2000 ripping up, then it supports the idea that risk on is broadening. That's very, very important. And then we have gold. If gold stays soft or at least stops accelerating when the fear trade cools, Bitcoin has more room to lead as the high octane risk asset while whale accumulation stays constructive. You want those bigger cohorts, those whales from 1 to 10,000 Bitcoin in their wallets. You want them to hold steady while price is challenging resistance. So what are the fake out check marks that we're not headed higher? Again, it's that 945K zone. So we could see another push to 93,000, close at CME gap, hit that 945K, and come back to rejection. At that point, we're more likely to see prices come back to where they are right now into this kind of 87k magnet that I've been talking about that that we've seen for such a long time. And if we break below, then guys, we have this deeper pullback and we will probably have to wait for a couple more months before we can come back up in my opinion because why? because there seems to be no huge catalyst at least for the couple months. So, I would be patient here, guys. Uh for me, I don't expect to see anything. I think we're going to chop sideways between 87K and 94K probably for a little while now. And while we're we're going to get data today, you'll have by the time you watch this, again, we don't expect the Fed to make any decisions on the interest rates today. And we're not going to have other decisions until next month. So, another month from now and even the who is going to become the next Fed chair is still a question mark. But we should find that out probably next week. And that could change a lot of things. That actually could change a lot of things, right? Because whoever is nominated as Fed chair will probably make a speech at some point and tell you what their policies are going to look like. And that could be very very dovish or it can be more conservative and be slightly hawkish. So, those could actually start the direction of a rally, but we'll have to watch and see when the new Fed chair is elected or nominated and then confirmed and then the speech that they make will really set the tone for 2026 and the way that policy is going to work. So, here's where we're at today, guys. The market just gave you a rare alignment. Risk appetite is spreading. Safe havens, well, they blinked quite a bit. Liquidity optics look better. Bitcoin hasn't confirmed yet. Yet, this is the kind of setup that precedes the move that feels obvious only after it's gone. And to me, it looks like 2026 is going to be fantastic. It seems like liquidity is going to come in. There's a bunch of stuff that I want to cover in another video, which is all the different things that are going to be happening in 2026. from the big beautiful law, from the tax rebates, the tax discounts, how effectively that puts quite a bit of money back in the pockets of taxpayers and a few other things that I expect to put a lot of liquidity into the markets uh this year, including things like raising the military budget and, you know, and also the reduction of regulation and how this [music] will take new companies that previously were regulated insanely uh into a better position to go public, bring more money in the markets, and IPOs are probably going to boom this year as well. So, we'll talk about that soon, guys. This is it for today. Until next time, stay sharp, continue stacking your stats, and I'll catch you guys on the next one. See you.",
