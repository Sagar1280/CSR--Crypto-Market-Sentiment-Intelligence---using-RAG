  "transcript": "Trump's tariffs are back and they're hitting markets fast. Crypto just bled about $100 billion in market cap in a blink. Last Thursday, we drew one line in the sand. $94.5,000. Hold it and the breakout attempts to stay alive. If we lose it and it turns into a fake out until proven otherwise. Well guys, yesterday we lost it and right now [music] Bitcoin is trading around the lows of 93,000 after flushing as low as $92,000. So today is not a vibes episode. This is the follow-up where we do the autopsy. Why did price come down and what does the chart say now in plain English? And yes, one of the headlines this weekend was literally Bank of England, aliens, and [music] stock market crash. We'll talk about that because even these meme headlines are telling you something real about positioning and risk. And again, remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. Welcome back, guys. This is a high signal only show. And so, here is the plan. The three real reasons price came down after last week's rally. The only ETF numbers that matter since Thursday macro update, but only what's new versus last week. So, if you didn't catch last week's Wednesday Thursday show, there's a bit more of a breakdown over there on the details. We're going to talk about the Supreme Court watch. Do the Supreme Court opinions and outcomes on Trump tariffs actually matter for markets? and we're going to do a little bit of simple TA, the new range, the new key levels, and two clean scenarios from here. Let's get straight into the why. Driver number one, the chart broke first, then the markets made up the stories after 94.5,000 wasn't just a number. It was the breakout validity zone. Once we slip below it, two things happen automatically. stops get triggered and leverage gets punished. In fact, we had about $864 million in longs wiped out. And because the break happened on a weekend, the thinner liquidity, well, things also get exaggerated. That's crypto 101, guys. Weekends don't create the trend, but they can accelerate the move. Driver number two, the spot engine cooled at the worst possible time. Last week's rally wasn't magic, it was flows. Here's the flow sequence that matters. On the 14th, $840 million coming in. On the 15th, it slowed a bit, but still positive as you talked about. 100.2 million. And then Friday, negative $394.7 million. So, what happened? The markets went from a monster spot bid to the bid stepped back a bit to net outflows. And once that happens while the price is sitting on a key level, you're fragile. If spot demand pauses, price doesn't instantly crash every time, but it loses the cushion that was holding up the rally. And driver number three is macro flipped risk off fast. and Bitcoin traded like a risk asset. Over the weekend and into today, Trump threatened new tariffs on eight European countries tied to the Greenland dispute. Markets reacted exactly how you'd expect. Equities down, haven bid into gold and silver, and crypto gets hit because it's still treated like a high beta risk asset when the tape turns nasty. And with that riskoff impulse came the punch in the face. Leverage longs got liquidated in size. This is why the drop felt violent. It wasn't everyone suddenly stopped believing in Bitcoin. Definitely not. It was positioning getting forced out as a tape turned risk off. So if you guys are asking why did the price come down? It's not a single narrative. It's broken level plus spot flows cooled plus risk off macro shock equals liquidation cascade. And the markets weren't the only thing taking hits, guys. Over the weekend, one crypto user reportedly lost about $282 million in Bitcoin and Litecoin after a social engineering scam. That's a brutal reminder that in this space, the biggest risk is often security, not only events like tariffs and sell-offs. Think about it. You worked hard to protect your crypto and your data.

Stay private, stay protected, and stay ahead. And a big shout out and thank you to Nord for sponsoring this episode. Now, let's hit the big news events because the headlines matter mainly as a trigger for positioning. So, the big event that everyone's talking about is the Trump tariff threat. The Greenland drama equals risk off. Whether you love it or you hate it politically, tariffs bring uncertainty around inflation, margins, retaliation, and growth. And today, the market treated it like a real risk. Not a joke. Also, you've got the Supreme Court watch on tariffs. This one is real. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the legality of Trump's broad tariffs under emergency powers. And the key point is this. Even if the court strikes something down, the administration is openly signaling they'll move quickly to replace tariffs with other tools. So markets may not get clarity. They may just get another phase of uncertainty. And I'll give you guys a clean read on whether this matters in a minute. But before that, my favorite headline, the Bank of England aliens headline. Let's be accurate. It wasn't the bank officially warning aliens will crash the stock market. It was a former Bank of England analyst urging contingency planning in case of an official alien disclosure shock. It's obviously meme tier on the surface, but maybe not. Let me know guys in the comments below. Are we going to get full government disclosure about aliens this year or not? I don't know if you pay attention like I do, but it does seem like something is coming in that direction. But the market lesson is actually serious here. Even though it was a meme headline, institutions are in a tail risk mindset. And when big money shifts into tail risk mindset, they don't chase upside aggressively. They derisk, they hedge, and they punish leverage. So yes, it's a bit of an absurd headline, but it fits the same theme as tariffs and Supreme Court risks. uncertainty rising equals leverage dies first. And it also just reminds me guys that I wouldn't be surprised at all if we had a big black swan this year. And probably that would probably happen in the first half of this year. And so always have that in the back of your mind in case it happens. Are you okay? Right? Are you massively leveraged? Do you have all your money in crypto? And if it goes falls back 80%, are you still going to be are you going to be in panic or will you be okay until it recovers? Now for the macro update, guys, for the holders who aren't day trading here, there's not a whole lot of new updates on liquidity. We haven't got those prints yet, but there is some sort of update on the Fed plumbing. You got the reverse repo that keeps draining. Latest weekly print is around 318 billion down from the prior week. What does that mean? That means that liquidity conditions are not tightening like a vice right now. This drop is much more about positioning and risk off headlines than a sudden liquidity regime shift. But essentially, they're putting some money back in the markets. And globally, the only new notable new macro development is that China's credit data was weak for 2025 overall. But December improved and the PBOC has been signaling, which by the way is a People's Bank of China, they've been signaling more policy support. That's not a one-day Bitcoin catalyst, but it matters for the medium-term liquidity tide if stimulus ramps. And I'm going to do a show soon too, guys, about what we can project for liquidity over 2026 and why that's very important. Okay, so now the question that you guys are probably wondering about the Supreme Court and does it materially affect the markets? Well, here's the clean answer. Most [clears throat] Supreme Court rulings do not move markets in a lasting way. They're usually too slow, too specific, and the market has time to discount them. But there are exceptions, and tariffs, well, they're one of them. Why? Well, because tariffs can directly hit inflation expectations, corporate margins, supply chains, and geopolitics. And this current case matters because it's about the scope of the presidential power to impose broad tariff barriers. So, how could this hit markets? Well, three ways, guys. One is if the court upholds broad tariff power. That's basically a green light for unpredictability. Markets price a risk premium. They can keep pressure on equities and keep the risk off reflex alive. Two, if the court strikes it down in a vacuum, that's relief. But if the White House immediately replaces the tariffs with other mechanisms, the uncertainty premium doesn't disappear. It changes form. The biggest impact is timing. Markets don't just react to the ruling. They react to the chaos around the ruling. headlines, retaliation talk, refund questions, and policy whiplash. And where I think the most important thing here is those refunds, tax refunds. A lot of that was going to come from tariff rebates or sorry, tariff, I guess you can call them dividends, right? Let's call them dividends. So that adds some more into the liquidity pipeline as well. So yes, for Bitcoin, the Supreme Court, it's not direct. But the Supreme Court and the tariffs and risk sentiment, liquidity, and positioning that does affect Bitcoin. And that's the chain of exactly how it happens. And just so you guys know too, right here, let's just quickly show you from Poly Market. There's a 30% chance right now that the Supreme Court rules in favor of Trump's tariffs. So, there's a $3.34 million bid on this. Some decent volume here. And I don't know, you know, I'm not sure how they would have this kind of intel, but regardless, Poly Market is usually right in the outcomes of what happens. So, if you're curious on how that might affect things based on what we just said, take that into consideration. So, let's make that actionable with the chart. And here's the entire technical map in about 60 seconds. Level one at $945,000 equals the broken level. It was support. Now it's resistance until proven otherwise. And again guys, this blue line over here, this blue line over here is what we were hoping that we would flip from resistance into support. We've broken below it. And also guys, remember that I said that we really want to see it for a full confirmation. The longer the timeline, the better. Well, on the weekly, it didn't hold above it, right? It This is the weekly candle here. Closed below it. So, lack the confidence to really say that was going to turn into uh more support in the long term here. So, for now, we're in this kind of new range and we have to talk about that. So, if Bitcoin can reclaim 94 and a half thousand and holds it, not just a wick, but for a longer period of time, again, the longer the time we hold above that, the more confident we get into that turning into a actual support zone uh with the next leg headed higher. That's your first signal. This breakdown might be a bear trap. If we keep falling below 94.5, the market is telling you that we are in this lower range now, like I just said. So right now guys, that $92,000 is the immediate battlefield. We're we already traded into the low $92,000s. So this is where you want to see buyers step in with urgency. So you guys can see over here we fell to this, you know, high 91,000 or $92,000 level. It quickly bounced off that and we've been kind of trending a little bit higher since then. Although I'm not sure how this is going to react. I have no idea for the rest of the day. But if that $92,000 price point breaks, then the next level, the next big magnet is $90,000. Why? That's a psychological and structural point. Round numbers matter in crypto because they anchor options, positioning, liquidation levels, and crowd psychology. And below that, you're looking at the next support band where price previously found buyers. So here's the two scenario framework. Scenario A, this is a bear trap and breakdown fails. We have a bullish recovery. What has to happen is that we reclaim the 94.5 level, hold it on a retest, and we need to see ETF flows to stop bleeding and at least stabilize. If that happens, the market will treat this as a shakeout and attempt higher again. Scenario B is the breakdown follow-through, a deeper retrace. And what it looks like is a repeated rejection under 94.5,000. $92,000 fails and we drift toward 90,000 with weak bounces in the meantime. In that scenario, I'm not calling a bull market dead, not [clears throat] by a long shot. I'm calling it what it is, a positioning reset after an impulse move accelerated by risk off headlines. And here's what I'm watching next, guys, is if you want to stay early and not reactive, watch this. You want to watch that $94,000 level. Is it going to reclaim and hold or reject and fade? Next, we're going to be looking at the ETF flows. On Friday the 16th, we had -394.7 million. If the next prints stay negative, rallies get sold. If flows flip back positive, the market can rebuild a base. And of course, the Trump tariffs and the Supreme Court, how they decide to vote on it. This is the macro tape right now. risk on won't fully breathe until this uncertainty cools off. So, if you're a holder, stop obsessing over intraday candles. You want to watch liquidity and the direction that it moves in, plus institutional demand. That's what actually moves the multimonth trend. And I'm going to do a show about liquidity this week and the events uh ahead that can make massive shifts in it. So, if you're not subscribed to the channel, guys, that's very important and I suggest that you do subscribe. hit that bell notification to turn everything on and we'll cover it. So guys, here's a takeaway. Last Thursday, we said that 94.5,000 was the line in the sand and yesterday we broke it. And today's riskoff macro pressure and cooling ETF flows turn that break into a real move. Now, it's simple. Reclaim 94,000 94.5 and this becomes a shakeout. fail to reclaim it and you're in a lower range with the 92 to 90,000s as the next battleground. Guys, let me know in the comments below where do you think we are again based on this new data, based on what's happened over the weekend, based on the headlines. Is this a bear trap and we're going higher or is this a breakdown? And that's going to wrap it up for today, guys. Until next time, remember, stay sharp, stack your Satoshi's, and I'll catch you guys in the next one. See you.",
