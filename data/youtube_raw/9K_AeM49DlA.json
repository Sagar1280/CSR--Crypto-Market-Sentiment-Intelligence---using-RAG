  "transcript": "[music] [music] Hibernation time. Bitcoin seems to have checked out for the holiday season as BTC's price trades mostly sideways. Fed roundup. We examine all the most important points from the last FOMC meeting of 2025 and look at what 2026 may bring. White swans. There are a few catalysts that could shake the crypto market out of its current slumber. So, we break down some of the main ones to look out for, plus of course the tweets of the week, TA with Lewis, a portfolio competition update, and much more besides. This is the Coin Bureau News Live >> and we are live. GM Coin Bureau fam, happy Monday and welcome back to another episode of the Coin Bureau weekly news. My name is Nick. Guy, what on earth are you wearing? >> I might ask you the same question, sir. >> You're wearing a a shirt that's other than white. >> Listen, I the the the audience spoke last week. They they made their displeasure clear about the fact that I always seem to wear the same white t-shirt. So, here we are. Like, this is this is literally the only manifest green >> colorful t-shirt that I have in my wardrobe. >> You're trying to manifest some green candles. Yeah, I'm trying to I'm trying to get us back up to 100K just by dressing correctly. >> Well, let's see if we can come it and we can manifest during the stream. >> That would be nice, wouldn't it? Uh, do you want to talk us through whatever >> this is outfit? [laughter] >> It's whatever you guys think it is. Use your imagination. It's from the >> Yes. >> Let's see if they can identify. Let's see what they think it is. Let them uh, you know, speculate in the comments. It I will say it is not a sex robe. So, just get that out the way. [laughter] Okay, that's a relief. >> That's that's important to mo to note, but let's see. >> I would say it's the sort of attire that that you see people being arrested in at sort of 3 in the morning. >> Yeah, it's very sucky. Very smooth. You want you know it's very >> No, no, no. I'll I will take your word for it, Nick. I'll take your word for it. >> Cool. Well, anyways, guys, thank you for joining in. Of course, uh we've got a lot of stuff to cover in the news today. Firstly, hibernation time. Bitcoin. Are we going to get that famed Santa rally? boo here Santa. >> Yeah, >> he's staring at us. >> He's giving me the creeps. >> Yeah, we're going to look into Bitcoin's price over the past week. We're also going to be looking at the roundup of the Fed meeting because I think the money printer could slowly start start turning again because there was talk of QE. >> We'll dive into that and then we'll be looking at potential white swans. I'm sick and tired of hearing about all these, you know, potential black swans that could swoop on the market and destroy our bags. So here we're going to look at potential catalysts that not many people have priced in at all. >> Okay. >> That could take us higher. >> So we're going to be looking on the positive side of things. >> Exactly. The positive side of life. >> Well, that's always look on the bright side of life, guys. >> Absolutely. >> And then of course, tweets of the week, some TA with Lewis. Uh and our portfolio competition. Don't forget about that because I think we slightly How are we looking from past week? >> Well, uh I the guys full ported into Bitcoin last week. We are still down, but you know, we're okay. We're okay. We're about $250 off the uh off breaking even >> almost only $250. Not bad given the market conditions. So, we're going to get on to that. Guys, don't forget to hit the likes and subscribes, of course. >> Yep. Ring the bells. >> What are we going to do if we hit 1,000 likes this time, guy? >> 1,000 likes. Uh maybe you could promise never to wear that again. >> I can't promise anything. [laughter] It is comfortable, guys. I'm sorry. Uh, okay. If we get a thousand likes, uh, well, I've been doing I've because there hasn't been much happening in the spot market, I've been doing a few trades recently. So, I could I I could share some of those with you, tell you what I've been, uh, placing my >> They have been quite profitable, right? >> Uh, yes. Actually, bizarrely. Yeah. So, I could I know I know. Uh, so we could talk about those. You can see the status bar just below Nick there. If that gets to 100%, i.e. we get a,000 likes, >> then that's that's what we'll uh we'll fill you in on. >> Yep. Set those likes, guys. >> Okay. Cool. So, let's dive in. Let's dive into what happened to uh Bitcoin last week. So, starting off on Monday, uh you'll know that Strategy bought 10,000 Bitcoin. We thought he wasn't he wasn't, you know, die hard to the cause and there he was again almost a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin bought on Monday. >> That's a pretty chad move, really, isn't it? >> Pretty Chad move. That's after the week prior where there was all the FUD around O Strategies dividend reserve. What's he doing with that? It didn't last long. [laughter] We got the dividend reserve. We we stacked some fiat. He felt dirty from that. So he said, \"Let's go back and buy some Bitcoin.\" >> I love it. I love it. >> Okay. Um then uh on Tuesday, now we we were still Sailor was still sort of headlines on Tuesday. Um he announced that he was um not going to issue preferred stock in Japan um in order to give Metanet, which is obviously Japan's number one, basically the strategy of Japan. Um he's going to give them a 12-month head start. >> So kind of him. So kind of him. >> That's good of him, isn't it? That's that's the sort of cooperation that we like to see between Bitcoin. >> You can go and tap the Japanese retail investor before I will. So, you know, you got a 12-month head start. So, do what you can. Um then, sorry, I'm going to log down my PC. Then, Bitcoin broke through. I got to log out. One second. >> Okay. Well, Bitcoin went through uh 93K and 94K. So, we were kind of getting a little bit hopeful. Um and uh but then um we also saw this. I did not understand what this was about at all. Eric Balcun is tweeting about this. Um this is Bitcoin after dark. Yeah, I was wondering that then the the naming convention for this I think they didn't they didn't consult their branding the branding advisers because it sounds kind of dodgy >> either that or very illicit. So X-rated so after dark kind of stuff the after dark trading Bitcoin ETF that you hide your kids away from. >> Mhm. >> I I kind of thought maybe Bitcoin had launched its own Only Fans or something like that. You know, times were so times were so tough it was having to it was having to take that route. No. So this is a new uh this is an ETF that will only hold Bitcoin at night. >> Yeah. Well trade I think um the ETF that will try and trade Bitcoin. Yeah. After hours market. So it's interesting. >> Okay. >> Because all those volatile you know those those scam wicks and those uh you know the market makers doing their funny the witchin hour the Bitcoin witchin hour 3:00 a.m. Asian time the whales go and smash it through. So yeah >> the ETF product we didn't know we needed. >> Yeah there we got it. Well there we go. >> Okay. So what about on Wednesday then? Wednesday uh standard charted uh if you recall these guys had a 200k Bitcoin price prediction for the end of this year. So come came to December and the the research head research analyst was was discussing with these boss and he's like what's our price prediction for Bitcoin again? Oh it's 200k. Oh okay should bring that down a little bit. Minor adjustment. >> Yeah, minor adjustment. Maybe slash it by I don't know 50%. Okay. So yeah, I mean I personally given the way the market's going at the moment, I still think that's a little bit ambitious, but I mean that is that is one hell of a uh a retracement. >> Next week standard chartered revised price prediction. [laughter] >> Um okay, and obviously weddednesday was a big day uh because it was the day of the FOMC meeting. We were all hanging on Powell's every word. Um we got what we were expecting, a 25 basis point rate cut. Um and uh but obviously seasoned Fed watchers were really keeping an eye on on uh Powell at the press conference afterwards. >> Exactly. Listening listening in on that Fed speak passing the land. Uh but they weren't really expecting this though. And this was the announcement that the Treasury the Fed would start buying uh $40 billion in Treasury bills over the next 30 days. So >> uh we'll be getting we'll be getting on to that in one of the next sections. Uh but in terms of projections for uh interest rates, this is the dot plot. Uh the uh consensus view among Fed officials is that we'll only see 25 basis points of cuts next year. So slightly hawkish. >> Yeah. Which kind of explains uh why we got a bit of a sell the news event really why the market sold off afterwards. Uh Bitcoin went down to close that CME gap that Nick had uh flagged up last last. >> Another one, man. Another one. There we go. >> Just it just always happens. Um which takes us to Thursday. Now, this saw another bank um jumping on the Bitcoin structured credit bandwagon. >> Yeah, if you'll recall, I think JP Morgan did one two weeks ago. Uh Goldman Sachs did one a week ago. So, it just shows this institutional adoption and institutionalization of Bitcoin with these structured products is taking place at a breakneck pace. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. And then um bullish as well, Congress really wants the SEC to allow people to invest their uh to invest in Bitcoin in their 401ks. They really want that. So they wrote a letter to to Atkins. >> Okay. So I mean that is potentially huge pools of capital um coming uh coming into BTC at some point in the future. Um and that takes us to Friday. Now Nick, can you explain there was some options options stuff going on? >> So this is from Jeff. First of all, this is the options implied volatility, the BV index and um it's now at um it's dropped to an annualized 45.1%. It's the lowest since November 10th and that's down from a peak of 65% observed on November 21st. In general, options implied volatility has been dropping a lot over the past few months and many people have been wondering what's happening here in the options market because that means that there's a lot of sellers of options, lots of supply and this is quite interesting as well because Jeff Park who's um you know used to be at Bitwise head of Alpha Strategies but now he's at this um um with Anthony Pompiano's digital asset treasury company but he's an options guru right and he knows all about this stuff and this is basically the concept that all these Bitcoin OGs instead of selling their Bitcoin, >> uh they have been writing call options and basically capping their upside to get yield on their Bitcoin without selling their Bitcoin without realizing taxes. >> And this is something I've heard also the likes of Matt Hogan from Bitwise say in a podcast last week is that these OGs instead of like selling out of their Bitcoin, they're selling out in the upside upside with these options. So selling options, call options, and they're getting a yield on their Bitcoin and that's fine for them because they're happy with the gains they have so far. or they don't want to realize it and this is why options implied volatility has also been dropping. >> Okay. Okay. So, Wales Wales at play. >> Yeah, Wales at play. Exactly. >> Okay. So, um there was also further news on uh Friday with silver overtaking Bitcoin. >> That's that was tough to see. >> What a fall from grace, bro. >> Yeah, >> Peter Schiff probably like just sitting there. >> Is Peter Schiff in silver though or does he regard it like Bitcoin as regard Litecoin with barely concealed contempt? No, he doesn't. He actually I think he said in I did an interview with him about three weeks ago and he recommended getting into silver now. Okay. Yeah. And that was actually before silver had a pretty pretty big run. So, congrats to him on that one. >> Silver's interesting, isn't it? Because obviously, you know, it's it's a beta play on gold, but it's also got a lot of industrial use as well. >> Solar panels and everything, guys. Yep. >> Okay. So, uh, Bitcoin not finishing the week. Great. What about the weekend to Monday? Anything happened there? >> Um, yeah. So, Vanguard actually called Bitcoin, and remember guys, Vanguard is the biggest Bitcoin hater there is, and they called Bitcoin a digital toy like a labu. >> Okay. >> How do you feel about the fact that you have been compared to Bitcoin? [laughter] >> Would you would do would you care to comment on that? >> He's keeping very quiet. >> He's not very happy with that. And he's like, \"Please call me anything, but don't call me do not call me a digital go.\" >> How [laughter] dare you? Um, so yes, we saw Bitcoin selling off a bit on Saturday. It fell below 88K. Um, but what does that mean, Nick? >> You know what that means, man? Congratulations. You played yourself. If you bought, if you shorted, you played yourself because Bitcoin rallied up and it's it almost came close to obviously a Sunday move in Bitcoin implies there's going to be a gap of some description. In this case, it was surprisingly to the upside because we fell uh on Sunday and even today, this morning, we started, you know, slowly going back towards closing that gap. We know we haven't closed it just yet. We'll be getting back on to that in a sec. We're also unfortunately back in extreme fear. Guy, >> are you extremely fearful? >> I am extremely fearful, but only because this boooo is giving me funny looks. But, uh, yeah. So, um, yes, cuz we had optimism was you felt kind of returning, but now now as Christmas approaches, it's going back down. >> Get inside. [clears throat] I don't really this this metric doesn't matter to me to be honest. Um, but anyways, it's all one perpetual emotional state. Stoicism. That's what that's what's been I've been taught here. >> That's all you can be. >> Yeah. >> Okay. So, uh coming up this week, we have well there's a lot of data that's been kind of delayed because of the government shutdown, isn't there? So, we've got delayed jobs numbers, we've got delayed inflation, we've got Fed members speaking, and we've got a BOJ meeting as well. >> Yeah. Lots of big important economic data uh points coming out, but we'll get on to that in a bit. On the momentum side, it's not looking too good, Brav, because uh weekly we've actually closed our fifth weekly close below the 50week moving average. And it's also worth noting last week's close or like yesterday or the last week's close. Um it's the it's basically from a candlestick analysis perspective, it's a long upper wick which indicates a rejection above 94,000. And the small red body, it means it's with a lower negligible wick uh shows this is a classic rejection pattern and it signals fading bullish momentum. >> Oh yeah. and selling of the rallies during that week. Unfortunately, >> on the daily chart, we have unfortunately this bearish flag as well, which many people have been pointing out. Uh and that's generally a continuation pattern to the downside, a bearish continuation pattern, and it could rally up uh towards the top of that uh flag. Uh where we actually also have the 50week moving average, which is will act as a strong 50, not sorry, not 50we, 50-day moving average, which will act as a strong resistance. Um I will note though in the short term like I said we've got that uh CME gap which still isn't filled and from the liquidity charts you can see there's a lot of liquidity to the upside. So market makers could push Bitcoin towards the um all those liquidity zones there where there are no doubt a lot of uh short stops and all that. So um that's what to keep an eye eye out for for this week. Um Santa may have unfortunately lost his way from the North Pole to bring us that Santa rally. Okay. Well, uh, someone is feeling the Christmas spirit. I've seen a few of you mention this in the comments, but I can confirm it. I'm looking at Look on Chain's Twitter, uh, feed at the moment. Michael Sailor Strategy just bought another ready for this 10,645 BTC. That's $980 million um, at an average price of 92K last week. now holds 671,268 BTC worth $60 billion. >> That's just insane. [laughter] >> Just does not quit. >> Does not quit. >> Sailor will not quit. >> Quit. Yeah. Just one week he's like he's going to go and diversify with a bit of cash next. No, I can't. I can't. So, there we go. Back to buying. But it didn't have that much of an impact on price last week. So, I don't know. Like, and it's still down. So, >> Sailor doesn't care that we're back in extreme fear. He doesn't know fear. >> He has no fear, man. Yeah. >> Um, but if you're as bullish as Sailor and you want to trade these Bitcoin markets, uh, then the best place to be doing that would be on our first brand partner. This is Tubbit.

Uh let me uh run you through the sentiment. Um, I don't know. It's kind of holding up pretty well. Uh, Dre is in the Christmas spirit. Happy Monday, you lovely people. I'm so hung over. Dre, do you want to explain what on earth on a on a Monday? >> On a Monday. >> Well, to be fair, guy, there's been a few times that [laughter] >> you've been in that state and you literally have to scream. >> Yes. Computer blue is wondering if I'm hung over today. No, I'm not. I'm I'm absolutely fine. Thank you very much. >> You look perfectly fine. >> Yeah, this these suggestions of unprof unprofessionalism on my part. Um, Cody Harris is not feeling bullish. 40k Bitcoin by October 2026. My word, the gonna be some tough live streams to do of bitcoins. >> I've seen I've seen some really bearish I've seen some really bearish calls over the past day down as low as like I think Peter Brunt, one of these technical analysts saying down below 30K. >> So, I don't know. Hopefully not. >> Okay. Eco, who who you would think given their name would appreciate green actually doesn't like it at all. Go back to white. There's no pleasing some people. Um, and at Pilly 1000, uh, 10,000 likes, guy wears new color t-shirt every week. It's a It might be a bare market. You mean I have to buy a new t-shirt every week? >> Oh, good. >> New color t-shirt. But I mean that the kaleidoscope of colors must be limited though by how many you can get. >> Exactly. Plus the only sort of nonmonochrome t-shirt that I wear. Um, people people really demanding especially in current market conditions. It's all a bit much. >> Okay. So, um, let's talk. So, the big story of last week that everything everything was hanging on the FOMC meeting on the weddednesday. Um, so as we said earlier on, we kind of got what we were all expecting. There were no surprises there. But, um, it nevertheless was the most important Fed meeting of our time. >> It was indeed, and I pushed this out last week. Today is the day. The day that crypto bros gather around and watch a 72year-old fiat overlord decide the direction of their freedom money. [laughter] quite apt. >> Things have changed, haven't they? Things have really changed since last cycle. Last cycle, I don't think anyone cared about what the Fed was. I mean, rates were rates were basically at zero anyway. >> Rome, pump my bags. >> Yeah. Okay. >> So, we thought we'd do a quick recap of what was discussed, what went down at that Fed meeting because unfortunately it is very important folks. We need to be aware of it. Um, so I mean the the headline one was that they cut the federal funds rate uh target rate by 25 basis points. So we're now in a 3.5 to 3.75 range. >> Yeah. This was a contested vote. Uh three policy makers dissented. One favored for a larger cut and two wanted no change at all. >> Mhm. Now the two buzzwords of this particular meeting were unemployment and inflation because this decision came with uh slowing job gains, a slight uptick in unemployment which Powell kind of acknowledged that they were watching along with inflation. Um and on the topic of inflation obviously that is still above the Fed's 2% goal. It's what 8% at the moment I >> believe unfortunately. Uh now we also mentioned the dot plot earlier. Uh so this is the forecasts by the Fed governors themselves. Uh they only forecast one um cut next year although the market doesn't believe them because the Fed CME Fed watch tool in terms of pricing in the interest rate futures market. there's at least a 75% chance of more than one rate cut next year. >> Okay. Now, uh again, Nick mentioned this earlier and a few people, a few market participants have seized on this um saying that maybe uh QT obviously ended at the beginning of this month. Quantitive tightening came to an end, but now people are speculating that QE may be back. Um and if we can pull up there, we are >> pr It's never that meme's done a lot of heavy lifting over the years, doesn't it? But it never gets old. Um, so this was the announcement uh obviously that the Fed will begin purchasing about $40 billion per month of shortterm Treasury bills. >> Yeah, they officially called this the reserve management purchases uh RMPS, a term that they stress is not traditional uh QE. >> Um, and technically the Fed says that these purchases are aimed at ensuring adequate liquidity and maintaining control of short-term rates, not stimulating the broader economy. So they they were really trying to be like this is this is not QT this is just about this not Q guys not although you know it's all in just the wording right like I mean this meme is quite fitting for that to be honest [laughter] >> cuz guys it is >> just just just repackage it with a different acronym different uh different set of letters and uh and it'll all make sense um so I mean we we need to ask ourselves is this really QE >> I mean so QE let's be defined I mean if quantitative of easing is a term basically used to inject liquidity into the market. The most market participants associate QE with the post208 one which is when they targeted at buying long-term treasuries to bring down long-end rates. And this is done to this particular one was done to reduce stress stresses in the liquidity markets specifically the spreads between the s the soft rates and um the Fed's funds rates. >> Okay. So there's an important distinction already because as Nick said it, you know, post 2008 it was long-term rates uh and long-term uh treasuries. Uh as we just discussed earlier, the Fed at the moment is talking about injecting this 40 billion per month into short-term treasuries in order to control short-term rates. And of course, as we all know, there is quite a difference. >> Yeah, indeed. And the official line is that this is technical maintenance of liquidity, not a policy to lower long-term yields or boost growth directly. >> Mhm. But however, some analysts are saying that well, you know, you can call it what you like, but if you're adding assets back to the Fed Fed's balance sheet, it's basically functions in a similar way to QE and will increase liquidity in in markets. Now, obviously, liquidity is something that we've been crying out for, right? >> Yeah, exactly. So, it's going to help reduce the stress in the traditional banking system. Uh, but yeah, I think at the end of the day, it is the Fed buying and injecting liquidity into the markets. And I think that this is just the first, you know, trickle that's going to eventually lead to a flood next year. And this is just Jerome who's kind of become a lot more doubbish recently, let's be honest. >> And he's just trying to like caretaker until the April whenever the new governor comes in. >> And uh then they they speculating this is all that's required. This is going to come. Many people out there the the global um macro experts are saying and especially in the crypto field are saying like yes this is going this is the nothing stops this train the government you need to bring liquidity into the markets we need to uh and I think this is what's going to happen I think that um QE is likely to come next year if Trump gets his way in terms of like juicing running the economy hot >> okay so you think this this sort of annual um monthly injection of of of 40 billion into short-term treasuries you think this is kind the Fed's way, Powell's way of sort of priming the market for increased liquidity as we get into 2026. You think this is kind of, as you say, the beginning, the early trickle? >> I think I think it's a situation. No, I think the way he worded it is like, okay, he's doing this specifically to try and solve the the short-term liquidity issue and the stresses in that market. But he's basically saying we'll look to potentially end it towards by the end of my tenure or April, May next year. >> But he he's going to be leaving. He's like, I've done my job. I'll we may stop this, but then do you think if the new governor is coming in there, they're going to be like, okay, let's go. Let's let's not stop this. I think they'll basically override it then. No, actually, let's go harder. >> Yeah. >> It depends who's going to be the governor, though, because um I think there's now a competition between Hasset and Walsh. >> Yeah. >> Walsh is actually a bit more, you know, hawkish than than Hasset in terms of like >> um he's he's not a big fan of QE. He wasn't a big fan of KE, but >> Okay. >> Yeah, it's definitely a good sign. It's a good sign. >> Okay. So, yeah. And this interesting because Trump actually name checked Kevin Walsh, didn't he? So it's it's a battle of the Kevin, but the odds on poly market between Walsh and Hasset have narrowed quite significantly I think in the last few days. >> So yeah, I mean I guess this is I guess this in a way Powell just doing what's in his power to do before you know potentially a completely different Fed. And as we say Pal's tenure ends in May next year. So he's, you know, he's on the home straight. He's got he's he's looking looking to retire and go fishing soon, [laughter] >> but he uh wants to control what he can still control. >> Yeah. And if you guys want to hodddle your Bitcoin until May next year when they run the markets hot, the best place you can do that is on a with a hardware wallet in cold storage. And this brings us to Tang, which is one of our brand SP partners here. Uh they your all-in-one crypto solution with no seed phrases, middlemen, or compromises. And uh this is they've released something a new a new product feature of Tangent Pay which is a non-custodial payment account with a virtual Visa card. It stays fully on chain and and Eron from Coinb Trading actually did an interview with the Tangent Pay CEO about two weeks ago. >> Um so go and give that a watch. We'll leave it linked to down below. And yeah, if you guys want to get your Tangent device or sign up for the Tangent Pay weight list, uh you can scan the QR code over there. Use the link down in the description and you'll get uh 30% off of your Tangent Pay device as well as $10 in Bitcoin rewards if you go and use our QR code over there right now. Smashing lovely stuff. Okay. Uh before we move on and uh and really start puffing at theium pipe, I want to draw your attention to that status bar below. Nick, it is only at 30%. You can do better than that. Keep smashing that like button. Just just just hammer it relentlessly. Let's put that Monday nervous energy out. >> Okay. So, um there's been a lot of doom and gloom around at the moment. Kind of, you know, you only need to look at the charts to see why. And as Nick pointed out earlier, we're back in the realms of extreme fear as far as sentiment goes. So, we thought we'd try and look on the bright side a little bit. We'd try and look at a few factors because at the moment, it's kind of hard if we're looking towards the end of the year. You know, a few people have been asking me, well, you know, do you think we're going to go to 100K, you know, before the end of the year? What do you think the rest of December looks like? And it's like, well, it's possible, but I at the moment I just don't see any catalyst, you know, any obvious catalyst that could take us to that level. But what that got us thinking about was what in the longer term we could look out for this the the potential white swans that could take the market a bit higher. >> Yeah. The other end of the tail of the the distribution. So these are white swans. Firstly, like let's just quickly mention some of the stuff we know is potentially likely that could be a catalyst next year for Bitcoin. Like one, as we've mentioned, the money printer by the Fed. Trump wants interest rates at 1%. [laughter] Uh which is interesting. Uh we've also got the market structure bill, right? This is potentially this has been pushed back to next year apparently, unfortunately, but you know, it's still being worked on hopefully. >> Uh we've got a Russia Ukraine war, which could that could end before then the end of the year. Yeah. Yeah, obviously this is being, you know, the details of this are being hammered out and I mean we've got to hope that it ends uh sooner rather than later, but um I I I've seen some interesting articles basically saying it, you know, >> as these things are argued over it. It it is basically entering its endgame phase. Um so I mean that is something that is highly likely for 2026 and that yeah that could be good for markets across the board, not at least in Europe because you know that could potentially um mean energy prices start falling again. Um, and there's also something that I don't see this talked about nearly enough. And this is the this is the possibility that the Supreme Court might strike down Trump's tariffs. >> Yeah, exactly. And this could be a massive boon for the markets, especially if there are those refunds that have to go back to the businesses, right? 168 billion in uh uh refunded to businesses. Although I have seen a some some analysis that says there's they could basically go with the middle ground which is Trump wouldn't be able to implement any new tariffs, >> right? >> But the previous ones could stay on or something like that. Um but um now let's but those are things we know that potentially could happen, right? But there are like we say these white swans, these tail risk, not risks or tail events that could be risks to the upside massively bullish for Bitcoin that we haven't actually priced in. And one of these is potentially a central bank buying Bitcoin. >> Yeah. Um so if a major central bank were to start accumulating Bitcoin as part of its reserves, you know, even say 1 to 5%. That would signal a whole new style of institutional acceptance. >> Exactly. And the price impact would be massive because of course Bitcoin's got a supply that is fixed and central banks buy serious volume. I mean just look what they've done to the price of gold. >> Yeah. Absolutely. You know, central banks have been buying gold like it's going out of fashion. Um and you know some analysts are predicting that Bitcoin could end up in central bank reserves around 2030. Um and again you know this is part of the digital gold narrative. >> Yeah. And some central banks have even toyed around with the idea of crypto in their test portfolios including the Czech central bank. >> Yeah. And it's interesting isn't it because at the moment we're seeing a lot of wrangling uh within Europe about these these Russian reserves that are held with euro clear. And I'm sure Russia and you know plenty of other countries are looking and and thinking well you know are we going to hold reserves in foreign banks in foreign institutions um surely it would be better hold our own reserves and of course one of the great things about Bitcoin is that it is you know the whole point is self-custod >> exactly permissionless no one can grab it from you uh another thing potentially do you think Trump could eventually get that Bitcoin strategic reserve out [laughter] Bitcoin [clears throat] Act of 2024, I mean of 2024 is two years later in 2026. >> Yeah. I think I I personally think the the Bitcoin strategic reserve certainly at the federal level in the US I think that's just going to be dangled in front of us every few months or every year or so just to sort of go ah you know oh it's it could be happening. I mean interestingly we are seeing individual US states actually you know unilaterally setting up their own strategic reserves. So I personally I I just don't see a federal strategic reserve happening. >> That's in the US. I mean the Chinese could implement their own strategic reserve. You know it is an asset that sovereign asset and like I said they've been buying gold and this the Chinese state could. >> Yeah. >> So that's on the Bitcoin strategic reserve idea. Um, another one curveball uh is a massive AI company allocating some Bitcoin to its balance sheet or allocating buying Bitcoin for its balance sheet and allocating to Bitcoin. >> Yeah. >> So, Google, Microsoft or Nvidia publicly allocating a massive chunk. I mean, it's small for them in terms of the size of their balance sheet, but let's assume like a $10 billion chunk of liquidity into Bitcoin. >> And Microsoft even remember last the beginning of this year, Microsoft shareholders voted on whether they should add Bitcoin. Okay. It was 99% [laughter] >> 99% to one, but it's it's >> So, you're saying there's a chance. [laughter] >> It's 1.5% in the next shareholder vote. >> It's progress. It's progress. >> It is progress. And look, you know, a few years ago, uh, another technology company was sitting on large cash reserves and all of a sudden decided to allocate them into, uh, into Bitcoin to protect against inflation, you know, melting them away. And um as we said earlier, the those lunatics are still buying Bitcoin. That was what was then micro strategy. So um yeah, I mean it's it seems a bit farfetched, but it's one of these things like, you know, first slowly and then all at once. >> Yeah, it's a massive supply shock from an institutional buying. Um and it sends a signal to everyone else potentially in the tech sector that this is uh something you can consider for your treasury, so CFOs or something. >> Um now other potential white swans out there. um one it could be a major pension system or scheme allocating at least 5% which is what's recommended by financial advisers now to Bitcoin I think the likes of the um Kalpers the California pensions uh for teachers or like a massive sovereign wealth fund or one of these massive pension funds super annuation funds they could potentially allocate that would be massive and it would of course be a signaling thing again where other pension funds could feel comfortable with that. Yeah. And of course bubbling away beneath the surface as well is um the idea of tokenization of real world assets RWAS. Um and there's every chance that you know this could suddenly again first slowly and then all at once this could suddenly catch fire. Um and I mean we've got Paul Atkins of the SEC saying you know in in um all markets all US markets will eventually be on chain from the SEC no less. And also um Black Rockck's Larry Frink singing the praises of tokenization. He's super bullish on tokenization. And this will be good not this will be good for like layer one blockchains. >> Yeah. >> That issue these tokens. So think Salana and Ethereum. >> Yeah. >> So if you guys are feeling bullish on those white swans we've talked about that could pump your bags next year um then you can trade them on our third brand partner and this is BitGet. And this of course brings us to our uh competition. So, for those who are joining for the first time, uh the the competition is this. We've got a trade a portfolio that's now at about $4,750. Started at $5,000. [laughter] >> Hey, but okay, look, let's be honest. From where it started at in terms of how bad the market conditions were. Could be way worse, right? So, you guys have been doing quite well over the past few weeks. And the people within the stream can vote on what how we allocate that portfolio every single week. and um they can decide on this the size and the coins we allocate to and then at the end of this in in I think in the end of this month we're going to be giving away that portfolio to one of our viewers who who's a a viewer right obviously you have to be watching this to know what the hell's going on [laughter] and b you have to have a bit account and you have to vote in these streams so a bit account if you don't have a bit account you can go and sign up right now with that QR code you'll also get all the benefits from uh signing up with that link you'll get up to 50k USDT in signup bonuses um and and so that's also on offer. So go and sign up right now if you don't have an account. But this now brings us to the question of what coin we should be allocating to the portfolio this week. So we opening up the vote now. There's four options for you. What are they going? >> Okay, so uh you might recall that last week um you guys voted to full port into uh into BTC. Um not the worst idea, but so we've now sold out. We're back in USDT and the options this week are Bitcoin again. Uh we also got Salana uh you know in honor of the recent Breakpoint conference and I've seen a lot of people asking about this in the comments. Towel is an option this week. Uh the the tow hing I think has just taken place within the last few minutes. Uh so we'll celebrate that with having tow as an option or we could just stay in good old USDT and uh and not do anything too too crazy. So, Bitcoin, Salana, Potenc USDT. Vote now. >> Vote now, guys. Cool. And that now brings us, if you want some advice in terms of what coin to vote for, this brings us to uh TA with Lewis. Lewis bringing out some charts. So, take it away, Lewis. and he'll show the way. Okay, guys. So, this segment is going to be pretty short because honestly, there's not really that much to say. Overall, I am feeling a little bit more bullish based off of a few things like total market cap, dominance levels, and other things like that. Plus the fact that Bitcoin is still grinding its way up even though it, you know, fell below this line. It's still on its way up. Same thing with Ethereum. It's on its way up. It's stairstepping its way up. Right? The weekly chart doesn't look too good. But what I'm looking for is essentially areas to either long or short that I believe have a very very high probability. And most of them aren't in those zones. You could see hype here is actually very very close to that zone. It's basically like on it right now. So maybe hype might be pretty good. But when I look at a lot of coins, a lot of them are looking like this where they're still above the places where I would really really want to buy them. So that's why I'm not buying anything right now. I'm still in longs from last week and I'm just waiting. But uh maybe maybe I'll grab some hype. But the thing is during this part of the market, this is literally the hardest part of the market cycle to actually trade. And I think that most people would be way better off just sitting on their hands right now or sitting in Bitcoin because if you were to trade say this part of the market cycle, let's say you accidentally mess up. Well, the market was very forgiving and it would go back above your entry price. Even if you, you know, FOMOed in, you would still actually do very very well. But now, you know, let's say you buy uh even you buy the dip, it doesn't come back up above where you bought it. sometimes. So that's why it's very very hard to trade right now and probably waiting until there's better conditions is good. So what I'm personally doing is I'm looking to create algorithms. I'm looking to create bots. I'm looking into ways to automate my system. I'm just looking at ways to refine my process and make things even better so that when things are easier, I could really go in and take full advantage of everything again. And I think that for most people that would be a really good thing to do to simply just review everything that you've done so far in crypto. See what's worked, see what hasn't, and create a really good game plan because being prepared is half the battle. And with saying that, since I don't really have any TA for you today, sorry. Uh I'm just going to hand it back to you guys and I'll see you all next week. >> Some wise words there. You don't always have to have a position. Sometimes don't force a trade. >> It's actually good timing. You know, we're we're in holiday season. You know, this is this is the time to be spending spending your precious hours with friends and family. So, don't worry about the charts. Check out. They'll still be there in January. I think that's sound advice. >> Touch some grass. >> Touch some grass. Even if it is covered in snow. >> Okay. Um so, we have uh we've had Lewis with the TA. So, let's close the vote on which uh particular crypto we're going to add to the portfolio this week. Um, can you reveal what >> it's Bitcoin again? >> You guys are You guys are getting predictable. Predictable. >> Okay. Well, nothing wrong with that. All right. Let's now before we vote on the actual allocation uh that we're going to make, let's have a look at some tweets of the week. >> Yeah. >> Well, the way we need to first open the vote for the allocation. >> Oh yes, we do need to open the vote [laughter] guy Monday. >> So, the the allocation will be open now. This is where you guys can vote for the amount that we put with the of the amount of portfolio we put into Bitcoin. So there's four options. 25% we're going to put half of that stack into Bitcoin. 75% or we're going to full port it again 100% into Bitcoin. So those are the four options. You guys can vote now and we'll be closing that vote in the next 5 minutes or so. So speak now quickly, guys. >> Okay, cool. >> All right, tweets of the week. Okay. So, first up, um who who is this gentleman and what's he on about? >> Um he he ends his his signature has quote world's highest IQ 276 uh IQ 276 holder, which is exactly the kind of thing that the world's highest IQ guy would write at the end of his his tweets. He has to clarify >> and he's saying that Bitcoin is reaching 300K in early 2026 is a logical scenario. >> Okay. Um, so trust me, bro. I got an IQ of 276. >> I mean, >> he's certainly getting a lot of mileage out of this high IQ of his, isn't he? >> I mean, yeah. Is this his own? Is he only do Bitcoin predictions or does he do other predictions as well? Like me to write is going to hit the earth in the next 6 months. >> I must say I've been fortunate enough in my time in my, you know, 40 plus years on this earth to meet some pretty clever people, some pretty high IQ individuals. And what I will say is that some of the smartest of them, some of the most galactically intelligent people I've ever met have literally been incapable of walking down the street without tripping over, losing their phone, falling in a river, or just, you know, they they they can do all this sort of high high level thinking, but when it actually comes to living life, they're completely useless. So, I'm going to take what Young Hun Kim IQ276 uh I'm going to take what he says with a large >> Let's see the trade, Bo. Let's see the trade. Open the trade or nothing. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter, bro. >> Okay. Now, uh last week, uh we also had Ben C from Into the Cryptoverse, uh here in Dubai, here in the studio with us, actually. So, it was great to meet him in real life. But of course, Ben is never better, um than when he is roasting people on the internet. So, um, this was, uh, Marty Party, um, said, \"Bitcoin breaks through the 200 day moving average on the 4hour on FOMC guidelines and then made the terrible mistake, the crucial mistake of saying into at into the cryptoverse was wrong.\" Ben Ben wasn't having that. >> He wasn't having that. Um, well, I mean, firstly, [laughter] the 200 day moving average on a 4hour chart doesn't really make that much sense. Um, so he yeah, he roasted him pretty to be completely honest. The fact that you were so clueless to even tweet something like this makes me honestly question your other analysis. Fair point, Ben. >> Burn. That was a burn. There were some hilarious replies under that as well. So, um, look folks, you know, Ben is a lovely guy. He is a genuinely really nice person, but my god, if you take him on on Twitter, you do so at your peril. He he takes no person. >> And you don't have to be a big account either. He'll go after you if you have a small if you're like 10 followers or something. If you go and throw some shade at him 6 months later he'll come back. He'll find your tweet and you roast it. Bro, >> he keeps receipts. He keeps receipts. Okay. Uh next up we have uh now this isn't technically a tweet but I'll allow it. Uh so this was from Reddit, right? >> Yeah, I found it on Reddit. I just had to go and check out what's happening on the Reddit uh on the Reddit thread. >> And this is actually quite quite sad actually because Okay. Yes, it is true in terms of what it means for alt season, but also the the history behind that image, you know, that that dead guy who's trying to find the the diamonds for the altcoin season. >> He was a real story about a guy who got stuck in a cave >> in 2009 and like it must have been one of the most excruciating deaths ever. >> But and so he was upside down. They struggled to get him out. He was stuck for 36 hours. His body was compressed. Um so it was this case and they could never get his body out. So they had to use explosives to destroy the cave because they could never get him out. He died there. So what I'm saying is that basically alcoin season in 2025 has actually been worse than that. [laughter] And that's what it's like to be in crypto. Um okay. Gosh, that was that was darker than I uh than I anticipated. Um so let's let's finish off tweets of the week with one from Michael Sailor himself. There we are. Will work for Bitcoin. >> I love the humor. >> It's this is this is what all these powerful American males have to do now. They have to go and do some time in McDonald's. Worked for Trump. >> Yeah, I worked for him, man. >> Okay. Uh dates for the diary. >> So, December 16th, we've got those delayed employment reports. Uh this is the NFPs. They're expected at 50K. And we've also got inflation numbers on December 18th. Uh the 3.1% is expected. This is the CPI inflation with 3% previous. >> Okay. Uh we also have um so this was the um and then on the 19th of December we have the BOJ uh they are hiking rates to a whopping 75 basis points. Yeah. >> Although there's been a lot of FUD on the Twitter sphere around this rate hike is going to crash Bitcoin. Guys, like I said, there's a 98% probability of a rate hike, right? So when the market has that kind of probability on a rate hike, it means it's priced in. I wouldn't expect Bitcoin to crash unless it's way more than the 75 basis points uh the market's um expecting. >> Okay. And then on December 19th, finally, we've got uh same day, we've got the Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations data coming out. So, that's important to watch from the perspective of the how people are feeling on the broader economy. You know, the whole question of the K-shaped economy kind of stuff. >> The good people of Michigan, we we look forward to hearing from you. Don't let us down. Don't let us down. those those Michiganes. What what would you call someone from Michigan? Anyway, um so it is time to uh close the vote on how much of the portfolio we allocate to Bitcoin this week. Remember, we chose BTC. So, uh that vote is closed. Uh guys, can you reveal uh how much we're going to be allocating this week? >> Full porting it again. [laughter] >> No play no games, bro. >> Okay. So, uh let me uh bring up my uh let me share my screen here. I'm trying to add this to the stage. There we are. So, uh, we are on spot. We are going to do a market order. We are on BTC and we're going to turn that dial all the way up to 100%. Buy BTC. It is done. Okay. Okay. Well, that's what you guys voted for. Um, let's uh Yeah, let's hope we can uh finish next week higher and get get that portfolio back to bar again. That would be nice, wouldn't it? back to my entry, please, bro. Back where we started. Yeah. Uh, >> okay. Um, shall we just have a look at a couple of quick comments as well? Um, no, we didn't really talk about gold and silver. Um, but well, well, we talked about silver. Silver surpassing Bitcoin last week. >> We've got a video on Coinb Finance actually that came out two days ago. >> So, you guys go and check it out. It looks at gold and silver specifically. Yeah. And what's driving that rally? Also, platinum, which has also been rallying. Can you believe that? Yeah. Platinum catalytic converters, I believe. >> Yes. You come for the crypto, you stay for the precious metals. >> Um Nick look like he's about looking like he's about to fight Jake Paul. >> Would you fancy your chances against Jake Paul? >> To be honest, he he boxes. I'm not a professional boxer. I mean, he I wouldn't say he's a professional boxer either, but I would say he boxes more than me. So maybe he's been practicing for his fight against Anthony Joshua. Can you believe that? >> I know. That's going to be that's going to be interesting, isn't it? Anthony Joshua is enormous and a pretty good boxer. >> Yeah. six foot six versus like someone who's six foot one or something. And a professional boxer. Exactly. >> Well, I mean, everyone wants to see the Paul brothers beaten up by someone. >> But to be fair, I think he's, you know, I think Jake Paul's, it's a win-win for him either way because if he gets completely destroyed, he'll be like, you know what? He's a 6'6 guy. How am I going to compete with him? So, >> anyways. >> Anyways, that's enough from Boxing Bureau. Um, uh, go um Go Vind Wdi is going to sell his BTC for 95K. You have been warned, folks. You have been warned. Um, and, uh, last but not least, um, Sam uploads just says Yorkshire. Yorkshire. Sorry. Yorkshire. Yorkshire. Yorkshire. >> There we go. That's very good. >> He's just saying Yorkshire three times. I don't know why. >> He's allowed. He's allowed to Yorkshire. Yorkshire. >> Yorkshire. >> I don't know. I'm probably murdering that accent. [laughter] >> Okay. Uh, well, that's quite enough, isn't it? So, um, >> one one quick point. We need to get this clarify this import. It's very important point to make here. Mhm. >> People from Michigan are called Michiganders. >> There we go. >> Michigan. I never would have thought >> you come for the crypto and you stay for the precious metals knowledge [laughter] >> and the geography. >> They're going to stop coming for the crypto at this rate. Okay, folks. Uh it's great to see you. Um as ever, let lots of content coming your way across all our various channels. Don't forget to subscribe to Coin Bureau Finance if you haven't already because that is where you can learn all about precious metals and many other non-cryptoreated things besides. Um we will be back same time uh same place next week um in the runup to Christmas. We're getting close. Nick, >> how excited are you on a scale of 1 to 10? >> Ecstatic. Ecstatic. I can't wait number on it. >> Okay. [laughter] All right. Thanks for joining everyone. See you next week. It would be wonderful to cover [music] topics like the whole need for a BTC soft fork. The details less covered by most MAJOR PEOPLE. >> NOT MORE TURTLES at turtles and [music] sea dragons too. [screaming] Turtles [music] turtles. Turtles turtles. Turtle. [music] So, uh, look, I mean, you know, how do you feel? Vanguard, Vanguard likens Bitcoin to a digital labuba. I mean, how did that make you feel? >> Okay. And and I mean, do you do you feel that this is this is a feud that you want to take further? And uh what do you make of Bitcoin's current price action? Do you think we're in a bare market currently?
