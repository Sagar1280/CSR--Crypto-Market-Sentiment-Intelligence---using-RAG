  "transcript": "2026 is in the US the midterm elections and President Trump does not want to be a lame duck. >> 2026 will be a big year for crypto. Eric Trump just went ballistic on Sirius XM talking about Bitcoin. Big Amazon XRP news. But before that, let's talk about the greater crypto market in general. 2026 will be a big year for crypto because President Trump does not want to be a lame duck president. He knows that the crypto community got him elected. >> Bitcoin is going to the moon. As we say, it's going to the moon. I want America to be the nation that leads the way. And that's what's going to happen. No, you're going to be very happy with me. So in 2026, he will deliver for the crypto community. And it's not just him delivering for the crypto community. It's him delivering for his family who is allin on crypto and needs the US to be very crypto friendly. So 100% Trump is working with cryptosar David Saxs right now to deliver on the clarity act or market structure bill before the midterms. He's going to get the Clarity Act or something like it passed before the midterms to signal to the crypto community, hey, we're doing great. But even more than that, President Donald Trump will begin buying 1 million Bitcoin for the US Strategic Reserve this year, at least according to Ark Invests Kathy Wood. Listen to this. >> 2026 is in the US the midterm elections. Uh and President Trump does not want to be a lame duck. So I have a feeling uh that he is going to work uh with his crypto and AISAR, right? Uh to to do a few things. one, make sure we get that dimminimous uh uh ruling through uh make sure so because you know grassroots is where a lot of what we've been talking about is going to happen. Um but also it seems as though there's been reticence about actually buying Bitcoin for the strategic reserve. So far so far it's confiscated. uh the original intent was to own a million bitcoin. So I I actually think they will start buying because I think this will help Trump in a couple of ways. The midterm elections part of the reason he won uh won the presidency I think was the crypto community. Um yes and uh another reason of course is his family is all in on Bitcoin and and other uh crypto assets and uh they have you know we talked about the DATs earlier. They've kind of fallen apart this year. So um I think he's got all kinds of reasons to do this but the most important one is he does not want to be a lame duck. He wants to have another one or two productive years. And uh I think I think he sees crypto as as a path to the future. >> So Trump knows that he has to win the midterms or else he says it himself, he risks getting impeached. >> You got to win the midterms because if we don't win the midterms, it's just going to be I mean they'll find a reason to impeach me. Uh I'll get impeached. So, in order to win the midterms, he's going to have to remind his constituency, a large part of that is the crypto community that he is delivering for them. And if they're going to impeach him, imagine what they'll try to do to his sons who have huge crypto businesses in the US and around the world. Are they still into crypto? Yeah. His family has never been more into crypto. Here's Eric Trump in a recent interview going ballistic on the Sirius XM host over Bitcoin. Listen to this. Guess what Bitcoin prices were exactly 2 years ago from today. I'll tell you because you wouldn't know. 36,500 was the cost of a Bitcoin 2 years ago. We are up 180% in a 24-month period. The the the spot price of of a BTC is probably the number one performing asset of any asset. And and this is this coming from a guy who believes in hard assets, right? I mean, I run one of the great real estate portfolios anywhere in the world. Cryptocurrency is absolutely on fire. Cryptocurrency is taking on the whole world. >> Well, Bitcoin is up this year by about 5%. The S&P is up 15%. The NASDAQ 100's up 20%. Gold is up close this year. No, I'm just saying. >> Do you want to rever hold Hold on, Carol? Do you do you want to reverse that? I mean, do you want to go back two years? Do you want to go back three years? You want to go back five years? You want to go back 10 years? >> I I know how to I know how to dice the market has gone up on average of about 70% a year, year-over-year for the last 10 year period of time. All All I'm saying is if you invested in BTC 2 years ago is probably the best investment you could have made. If you made invested BTC 5 years ago, you're sitting on infinite amounts of money, right? BTC has been probably the highest performing asset of the last decade. >> Guys, invest in Bitcoin, invest in quality altcoins. Nobody wants to hear it, but I'll say it. The tokenization market has 10xed in the past two years. Most people don't realize. And one of the biggest players behind all of this has been chain link. That's interesting. That's interesting coming from Bitwise. What's even more interesting is this Amazon XRP news. XRP holders are kings today as just in Amazon Web Services and Ripple partnered to explore Amazon Bedrock AI for the XRP ledger. With this integration, the XRP ledger system logs could be analyzed in a few minutes, down from a few days. For more information on this huge partnership, let's actually look back. Brad Garlinghouse foreshadowed this collab just a couple months ago, September 2025. Listen. Amazon today, last time I checked, could only support payouts in 19 different currencies. Amazon is, you know, I think one of the two trillion dollar companies. And yet Amazon their marketplace which is a huge piece of their business they can only pay out 19 currencies and that is a hodgepodge of integrations around the world ranging from India to China to the EU. Now if you think about the implication of that to more tangibly a business you know we have had conversations with other networks other marketplaces like Uber Uber knows that if they can pay their drivers more frequently the retention of their drivers goes up. Uber has a a big challenge in that you people join to be become drivers and then they churn out. That means that Uber has to go acquire new new c new uh excuse me new drivers. That's not a great thing. Now some of you probably took a taxi here this morning. When you got out of the taxi you either paid them in cash or you paid them with a credit card which frankly would settle at a couple days. In contrast, when you're using Uber, the Uber drivers get paid every two weeks. Why is it they get paid every two weeks? How can we reduce the friction so every time you get out of the an Uber the Uber driver gets paid? Uber wants that to happen and despite being obviously a major player, you know, the ability the friction even associated for someone like that is challenging. Our vision is to truly enable global payments such that you can plug in with one API and whether you're seeking liquidity, whether you're seeking a a payment into a payment network, whether you're seeing a payment to a bank to reduce that friction such that it is real time and extremely low cost. By doing that, we think we can let ripplet truly scale to serve a new set of customer demands on demand and real time. Again, we we are all, you know, witnessing a generation grow up that are sometimes pjoratively described as millennials. They expect real time. They've grown up with the expectation that this is going to be a real-time experience. They can click on their phone and have ice cream delivered in 30 minutes. I do love ice cream. Let's not let's not criticize that. So we can make them lowcost. We can truly get a dramatic reduction in the error rate such that they're not failures and deliver an elegant experience both to banks and to their customers. Hey, if you're interested in making money in crypto in 2026, make sure you subscribe. We keep you informed on the entire cryptocurrency market on a daily basis. Altcoin Daily is so close to hitting 2 million followers on Twitter. You're going to want to make sure you're following us on Twitter as well. Look how close we are. Hopefully, you get in before 2 million. Look guys, this cycle is playing out differently than every other cycle. Now, a lot of people still think the 4-year cycle is in and that means we have a bare market this year. I don't necessarily think the 4-year cycle is still in effect. I think we're going to see a higher high this year. Some analysts even saying Q2 of 2026. Raul Paul says that this cycle mirrors 2017 and could peak in June 2026. Like he has many reasons for this. AI ETFs liquidity may drive crypto from three trillion to eventually over a 100red trillion. But then as far as June 2026, it's going to be closer to 10 trillion. Well, listen to him say it. >> The sovereign wealth funds and the mandate across the entire region from Saudi to Abu Dhabi to Dubai to Bahrain. um to Qatar is AI and blockchain >> and not just >> using Bitcoin as a reserve asset but also building the entire government infrastructure on blockchain driving licenses, property deeds, you know, the whole bloody lot. >> So, it's like it's fascinating to see. And then a lot of people say to me, well, if all of this money is coming in from the sovereigns, that may produce an outside return. And I'm thinking, well, if we're going from 3 trillion to 100 trillion, which is my estimate by just extrapolating out the trend rate of growth, you need larger players each time because the market cap is bigger, right? There's no way you're going to get to 15 trillion this cycle unless you've got bigger players. Um, so it's kind of I don't think it's what people think it is. I think it's just a function of the size of the market. The bigger it becomes, the more that those people are involved. uh and the more blockchain technology gets used the more it uses the alts for infrastructure rails for new forms of compute and storage and all the other things that are coming. So I just thought it was interesting because everyone's like oh my god it's a super cycle because of this. I'm starting towards well we talked about this before a longer cycle just because a the business cycle is still below 50. So generally it takes a while to climb up and then we use the GMI financial conditions index um and that has a 9-month lead and with the dollar breaking down even today it's starting to suggest that this could not this may go even into Q2 2026. So it's like the whole cycle got shifted because rates didn't get adjusted and the dollar was sideways for a period of time. So it feels that potentially there is a chance and again there's no guarantees in this world that we're more like 2020 than we are in 2021. >> Yeah. Or it's very also it's spooky similar to",
