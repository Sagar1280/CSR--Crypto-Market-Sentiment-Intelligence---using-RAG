[music] Yeah. >> For Bitcoin. >> For Bitcoin. >> And what what super cycle to you means what >> few people understand is how when this thing does hit, when this next wave does hit, >> I think this year given the US being so pro pro crypto and every other country is kind of following. >> It's not going to 140 guys, [music] it's going to 250 or 300 or 350. I'm very bullish on Salana from [music] the perspective of Binance founder CZ live on CNBC explains why he believes 2026 will be a super cycle for Bitcoin. Here's the latest news [music] that affects you if you hold crypto. Click subscribe for one video per day keeping you informed. And [music] Binance founder CZ says, \"I have very strong feelings that 2026 will be a super cycle for Bitcoin. Here's why.\" >> So, do you have any thought though real quick on just like the price of Bitcoin and where this is all headed? Do you think we're in a a winter, a summer cycle? Are you with Kathy Wood who thinks it's going to turn into a million dollars a coin? >> So, whenever people ask that question, I always get got to ask them, what's the time frame you're looking at? If you look at today, tomorrow on a daily basis, there's no way I can predict. If you look at a 10, five, 10 year horizon, it's very easy to predict. U we're going to go up. Um if you look at a one-year horizon, which is like where the most sort of common common framework is, >> um 2026, uh I'm not sure maybe I'm I think I have very strong feelings that you will probably be a super cycle. >> Be a super cycle. >> 2026. Yeah. >> For Bitcoin. >> For Bitcoin. >> And what a super cycle to you means what? Well, normally Bitcoin follows a four year cycles historically. If you look at historic data, like every four years, you know, there's a alltime high and then there's a there's a drop. But I think this year given the US being so pro pro crypto and every other country is kind of following um I do think we we will see this this we will probably break the four-year cycle. >> And CZ's thesis may be coming true. I mean just look at the total transaction volume in 2025. Mastercard did 9.7 trillion. Visa did 16 trillion. Bitcoin did $25 trillion total transaction volume in 2025. >> When this thing does hit, when this next wave does hit, it's not going to 140, guys. It's going to 250 or 300 or 350. >> When fundamentals are strong yet price is lagging, price tends to catch up to fundamentals strength given enough time. And as price catches up to fundamentals, heavily respected investor Lawrence Leard on the What Bitcoin Did podcast explains that when the next wave hits, Bitcoin isn't stopping a 140, it's going past 350. And here's why. >> I mean, because there will be so much, you know, there'll be two things happening. There'll be all the shorts who have to cover or else they're going to get their faces ripped off. And then there'll be a whole new category of long dgens who'll come in and who lever it and go long it, right? and and that's that's what'll shove it to 400 and then from 400 by the way it'll correct back to 150. But I mean it's it's the nature of a speculative you know asset that's being adopted. You know this is >> if you go look at a very long-term price chart of Amazon which is a similar networkbased business that had multiple you know what had one 90% correction had multiple 60 70 a lot of 40 50% corrections. I mean either it's going to take over the world or it's going to die. And right now, Bitcoin's in the, you know, right now we're kind of hearing, uh, it's not, I mean, I I just saw a tweet this morning from a gold guy. Well, not really looking like digital gold, is it? And I was just kind of like, you wait, you know, okay, you know, just just wait. You just you just relax. You know, it's it's not a straight line, but you know, I I I'll take the other side of that bet and in two years we'll see who looks right. >> Also, monster news for Solana. Ando Finance brings 200 plus tokenized US stocks and ETFs to Salana. The expansion comes as tokenized realworld assets, meaning actual real assets now tokenized on chain continue to gain traction across crypto markets. That literally means hundreds of RWA's real world assets just went live on Solana. Whether it's IBM, Visa, Nike, Intel, Amazon, Walmart, Chevron, Pepsi, hundreds of US stocks are now trading on Solana with Andogo Global Markets. The number of tokenized stocks on Solana just 4xed. And if you're asking why both Ethereum and Solana are separating themselves from the pack, I loved this perspective from investing expert at Banklist. I'm very bullish on Salana from the perspective of pretty much every founder I meet in consumer that is where they just default go to build right and two things they've nailed is a again everything consumer is happening there right now and b they're nailing a lot of the micro structure required to build low latency onchain order books and become the home for a lot of spot trading um and on the other side of the spectrum I expect to see like a very strong reversal in Ethereum sentiment. I think we've already begun that with Genius Act, Clarity Act, improvement in REV and TVL, DAT bid, institutional bid. I think everything is just going to go Ethereum's way this year in particular. So, at a high level, that's kind of why I believe like Ethereum and Salana's duopoly, for lack of better words, could strengthen. And the data backs that up for both. Solana's DEX volume is leading all chains. So, check this out. Soul could explode at any time. Not my words, the data says it. Sana just hit 4.4 billion DEX volume in 24 hours, leading all chains. So, Sana has the decentralized bid, meaning the more DEX volume, the more soul gets used, the bid price should go up if it continues. As Tom Lee's Bitine adds $108 million in Ethereum either way, Sana has that decentralized bid, that DeFi bid. Ethereum clearly has the institutional bid and this is signal always look for what institutions are laying down the plumbing the pipes which tends to lead to liquidity. So Justin Grayscale files for a B&B ETF. This is interesting because Grayscale obviously sees value in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana. They have an AI fund. Grayscale's AI fund now with 33.53% tow. But this is great for Binance or BNB. Every year tells a story. This report breaks down how the industry scaled, matured, and moved forward in 2025 and what that means for 2026. I loved this breakdown from Exchange Partner Binance. And just to read you an excerpt, although I'll link this full 2026 outlook in 2025 year and review down below in the video description, check it out. But from a macro viewpoint, the year 2025 was defined by data fog and volatility as markets navigated a new US administration, the liberation day tariff shock, and a government shutdown that obscured economic signals. But the biggest negative to crypto to all this was the uncertainty, was the newness, was this what the hell is happening? However, the outlook for 2026 signals a definitive risk reboot driven by a policy triumpvirate, synchronized global monetary easing. This one's a big one, substantial fiscal stimulus via cash tax refunds, and a wave of deregulation. 2026 is looking better. I'll link this down below for you to check out. And notice how retail is starting to get excited again. how this AI cryptocurrency could help you retire a millionaire. Now, that's a big statement. I'm not claiming one way or another, but understand that retail regular investors are getting excited about crypto. This, for better or for worse, is what brings retail in. They basically say that just like chat, GPT, and OpenAI led the AI wave in 2025 and that made millionaires. That's given based on the chart above which shows the relative performance of the top 10 AI altcoins by market cap. It's easy to see that two names BitTensor and Virtuals stand a head and shoulders above the rest. I'll keep my eye on this. Let me do a little bit more research. If you've made it this far in today's video, send this video to a friend. This could set them up for success in 2026. They could be thanking you by the end of this year. Thank you for sending me this one crypto altcoin daily video and starting me on my journey.",
