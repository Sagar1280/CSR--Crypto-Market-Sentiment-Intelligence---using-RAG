  "transcript": "What's up, guys? It's Dan from Coinbau Trading. Today, we're going to do a quick update about what's going on in the crypto market and whether gold and silver have topped. If this is the kind of content that you enjoy, then be sure to smash that like button, subscribe to the channel, and ping that notification bell. Before we get started, do keep in mind that nothing in this video is financial advice. It's just my personal analysis of the crypto market. Your analysis could be different. And if it is, that's awesome because the more difference of opinion that we have, the better traders and the better investors we're all going to become. So, I'll start off by reiter reiterating guys that I don't actually think the reason why markets pulled back had anything to do with Greenland. I think it had to do more with what was going on in Japan. And as I mentioned yesterday, it looks like Japanese bonds had stabilized. But of course, at the same time, we did get some, you know, you could say positive news around Greenland. So, if you're someone who disagrees and you think it all has to do with Greenland, then I'm happy to inform you that Trump has backed off uh his threats of military force says that there is a framework of some kind of deal. And I had also mentioned this yesterday that even Scott Bessant had been telling everyone that look this is kind of like a mini version of what happened in April 2025. The media and everyone is freaking out and markets will soon be recovering and rallying to new all-time highs. Uh, of course, as it relates to crypto, I pointed out yesterday that it looks like we had basically entered, I guess you could say, the end of this accumulation period that we've seen since November of 2025. If you guys have been keeping up with the headlines or if you're doing onchain analysis, you'll know that crypto whales have been accumulating throughout this entire period, especially Bitcoin to a lesser extent, Ethereum. Uh so, and even if we zoom in here on like shorter term time frames like the 4 hour, it becomes pretty clear that what we're seeing here is a formation of a bottom. And in the next couple of days, it's probably going to be a little bit of a bounce, but probably mostly some chop. Uh probably a rally up to the Ballinger band moving average on the daily for Bitcoin, which would be somewhere around 92,000. That would be completely normal from a technical perspective because when you break below a key support level, you get a rally back up to that support level to confirm, okay, uh, has this support level now become resistance. You get a rally back up to that support level to confirm, okay, has this support level now become resistance or are we going to get a continuation higher? Base case for the next couple of days would just be a little bit of a bounce and probably mostly chop. And then next week, we would probably start to see a proper recovery in the market. Same idea with Ethereum. Looks like it's bottomed here. And again, zooming into the 4 hour. I haven't even checked this, but I can bet. Yep, it looks like we're seeing a bottoming pattern of some kind forming here. And in the next couple of days, again, we should get a little bit of a bounce in the crypto market in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and some altcoins. Uh, and then a continuation higher uh out of this accumulation period that we've been in since November. That should begin sometime next week, I believe. Uh, and of course, that does bring me to what's been going on with precious metals because, of course, you know, uh, with gold rallying and silver rallying and a lot of people, you know, this is actually comes from the, um, uh, cryptocurrency subreddit. A lot of people have been saying, oh, like isn't silver the one to go? Like is all the liquidity going into silver and draining liquidity? And you know, pick your narrative, right? And of course, here you see silver slapping Bitcoin and saying, you know, what are you doing? Shouldn't Bitcoin be rallying here along with gold and silver? Well, I mean, the short answer is no, because believe it or not, guys, but Bitcoin is seen, you know, by by people who are in crypto, Bitcoin and crypto is seen as like a safe haven. But people who are outside of crypto, which is, you know, most of the trady capital, they all see Bitcoin as a risk asset. So basically like a higher risk um higher reward version of like a tech stock or NASDAQ uh index, something like that, right? Uh anyways, what's really interesting of course is that silver's rallying. Everyone's saying, \"Oh, it's going to keep going up and it's going to go parabolic and whatever, right? Everyone's feeling bullish and everyone's wondering why it's going on and there's all these different narratives going around.\" But I really want to drive the point home, guys, that the rally that we're seeing now, not just in gold and silver, but in other commodities, I think copper has been rallying recently. I mean natural gas know it's a little bit different because we have like that cold snap or whatever in the US but we're starting to see a rally or we've been seeing a rally in commodities over the last few months and this is consistent with the idea that we're we're basically at the peak of the global liquidity cycle as you guys can see this comes from Michael how who's an expert in global liquidity when global liquidity is rising you tend to see the biggest rallies in equities so like in stocks and that I would say that includes uh crypto to some extent and then once you see uh the liquidity cycle peaking that's when commodities take over like gold and silver uh and then of course after that peak of the global liquidity cycle, then we enter the contraction phase where basically everything crashes, which means that we're kind of, you could say, at the very end of the liquidity cycle right now. And that's the real reason why gold and silver and all these other commodities and precious metals have been rallying. And if you guys are skeptical of that, I'm sure there's already going to be comments saying, \"No, it's going to keep going up. It's going to go to 8,000, 7,000, 10,000, whatever, because central banks are accumulating and whatever.\" And that's true, guys. Central banks are accumulating. That's completely true. And there's a whole bunch, you know, all those narratives are technically correct. But the thing is guys, if you look at search trends, for example, for gold price, you can see that roughly since last summer, these search trends for gold price have been spiking. What does that tell you? That tells you that there's a lot of speculation or rather tells me that there's a lot of speculation right now in the precious metals market because of like logically guys, like you know, it's not central banks that are searching every day for gold price and thinking what is the price today, what is the price today. Central banks don't care. They're just slowly accumulating because for them it's strategic. It's part of their reserves. They're not obsessing over every single move. The only people who are searching for gold price are speculators. And that tells you that basically since or tells me that since the summer most of the price action in gold has been driven by speculation. And this is really interesting guys because when you get speculation then that means you get a lot of emotion. And when you have a lot of emotion that's when technical analysis comes in super handy and when it becomes more accurate because at the end of the day technical analysis is just analyzing human emotion. So in this case, you could say that all this rally that we saw in gold, you know, from 2023, 2024, this gradual grind higher that was driven by central bank accumulation, other stuff like that, maybe also some large investors accumulating. But this kind of blowoff top action we've seen since last summer, that has basically been speculation, which again you can confirm by just looking at the search trends. And that's really useful because that means that we can use very basic technical analysis here to get a sense of how much higher gold could go. And in my view, it's pretty simple. We have like a starting point here somewhere around 3,400. We have a resistance level somewhere around 4,300. We did see gold break above that resistance level a couple of weeks ago. And that suggests, you know, with the 900 difference, you just add 900 to 4,300 and that gives us a target somewhere around of around 5100 to 5200. So just over 5,000. You know, could gold already be topping here somewhere around 5,000. That's certainly possible. But the point is, guys, maybe I'll measure it out just for my own confirmation here. We are within whatever it is, five, let's say 5 to 7% of a gold high roughly. So, if you're buying gold now, then you're basically buying ve very close to the top. Like, you know, you missed most of the move here, whatever that percentage was here. Actually, take a look and see what that was. So, you know, you missed the 40% move. Are you really going to risk it to try and get another 5 7%. You're probably going to get bigger returns elsewhere. Probably even in crypto to be honest. That's just my personal opinion. Uh, but similar idea with silver. I'm sure you guys have heard all these narratives of, oh, silver's using all these industrial processes and now there's a shortage and there's not enough silver and you know, all these institutions are saying there's going to be a shortage. Sure. Again, like I do think that there's truth to that, but just like with gold guys, we can see that since the fall, so since roughly around October, September, October, search trends for silver price have been going parabolic. So ask yourself, people who are, you know, buying silver for industrial purposes and whatever else, right? The the actual fundamental demand drivers, the narratives, they're not searching for silver price every single day at this size, right? This huge spike in people searching for silver prices, that's coming from retail speculation. And that tells us once again that what's driving silver prices here is speculation, which I'll remind you, the speculation in gold and silver is consistent with the fact that we're entering the final phase of the liquidity cycle here with global liquidity peaking. Um, but anyways, uh, what's really interesting, of course, is because we're dealing with price action that's being driven primarily by emotions, we can once again use very basic technical analysis to get a sense of how high silver could go in the short term here. Same idea with uh you know October roughly being the you could say the breakout level when the speculation started taking over around that around that time. Silver was around $52. Then we have a resistance level let's say somewhere around $82. That gives us a difference of around 30. So all we have to do is add 30 to 82 and that gives us a target of somewhere around $10. So just over $100. And similarly we can take the measuring tool here and we can say okay well that's another you know 20%. Not too shabby not too shabby. But of course if we measure from the breakout level down here uh you know that was a 70% move. So, you know, you could say that on a risk-reward basis that silver probably offers a higher uh reward in the short term here compared to gold. And that's even consistent with the fact that the search trends for silver continue to go vertical. There's still lots of speculation, lots of rotation out of gold into silver happening. But on the gold front, we can see from the search trends that gold seems to be slowing down, which is consistent with the idea that gold could go a little bit higher here, but that most of the momentum is going to shift into silver here over the next couple of weeks or whatever it's going to be. Uh, and then after that, I do think that there's going to be a pretty significant pullback because again, guys, like you you can't be blind to the fact that we're entering this parabolic price action, if you think that this is going to last for months and years. I mean, it's already lasted for a couple of months to be honest, but if you think this is going to go on indefinitely, then uh, you know, I think you might be a little bit mistaken there. Um, but uh, you know, and I'm sure that you guys are all wondering what does that mean for crypto? To be honest, it doesn't mean that that much. I think the more important thing to watch when it comes to crypto is what's been going on with small cap stocks which maybe I'll just pull it up here just because I'm sure there's going to be some questions about that. If we look at the Russell 2000 here guys, yes, we did did get a little bit of a pullback in the last couple of days because of all this, you know, I personally think it's Japan, but if you believe it's Greenland and let's say it was Greenland, whatever. But what's really interesting, guys, is that even yesterday, you can see small cap stocks continued breaking out, which is a really bullish sign because historically speaking, maybe I'll zoom out to the weekly here so it's a little clearer. Historically speaking, when we saw a breakout in the Russell 2000 like we're seeing now, altcoins were not that far behind. And even JP Morgan found in their own research that Bitcoin is the most highly correlated to the Russell 2000. But that was granted that was early last year and these correlations change and yada yada yada. Um, but uh point being is that this breakout on the Russell 2000 is something that I've been personally waiting been waiting for for a long time. It's a very good sign. Couple that with again maybe I'll pull it up just so you guys can see. Couple that with a declining US dollar here over the last couple of days. Looks like the weekly close for the US dollar is going to be super bearish, which is perfect. That suggests the US dollar is going to continue falling. That suggests global liquidity is going to continue rising and that's going to basically help out assets like uh well like small cap stocks, like crypto. And this is something I would say is kind of independent of what's going on in silver and gold. Uh with that being said, I do think that there was probably some degree of rotation like people who are in crypto who believe that Bitcoin is like a safe haven and we're getting frustrated with Bitcoin's price action. I do think there was some rotation from Bitcoin into gold uh in like around last summer. Um but uh when it comes to stuff, you know, like altcoins and this type of stuff, you're dealing with something that's a little bit different. It doesn't really fit at all under that like safe haven precious metals, you know, they're not really adjacent to each other, right? You're it's not a commodity, right? You can make the argument that Bitcoin is a commodity, but it's kind of hard to do that with altcoins, right? And so that means it's more akin to the Russell 2000. And again, Russell 2000 has been breaking out. Maybe I'll pull up that chart again just cuz I I really like to see that. I didn't even notice that the Russell 2000 had broken out again uh yesterday. But this is a really good sign. Looks like the Russell 2000 is going to keep powering higher and eventually crypto should catch up to that and that's part of why I'm so bullish on Q1. And I'm going to be doing an in-depth video about that on Saturday. So be sure to stay tuned.
