  "transcript": "So clarity act endgame and that's what we are going to talk about today. You know, I've been tracking the clarity act for since the beginning if I'm not mistaken since we start spoking about it and I told you is in the end of 1025. It was one of the hurdles for January and we just had drama another drama on the market. We didn't had drama for quite a long time for crypto and now we are having some drama now with Coinbase pulling support for the clarity act and something happened tonight that we need to pay attention regarding this because this is uh how can I say it's mandatory for industry that we have clarity and first we need to understand what's happening what happened this night right before this stream and I'll tell you what's what's going to happen in my opinion and when we are going to get the clarity act if we are going to get the clarity act but so far stocks are down crypto started to go down a little bit nothing major and we need to understand the timeline what's happening and why maybe we are seeing this so stay with me smash like button subscribe to the channel and we'll dive into it right now so it all started with this it all started with Brian Armstrong from Coinbase saying that his pulling support from the clarity act and that for a lot of things and that in his view it's not the perfect bill and we will not get the perfect bill. I'll get back to that later. But yeah, he decided that the prohibition of DeFi, stable coin yields, a lot of thing here. And we need to understand um one thing regarding Coinbase. Okay. And I think this is really important to understand the Coinbase model. Coinbase is like a a crypto bank. Coinbase generated around $400 million of revenue from stable coin yields last year. Okay, just for you to understand why he's pulling this and why he's so worried about this. The he he's so worried about this because of this because it literally had like $400 million from revenue just from stable coin yields from West DC. So you can understand why he doesn't like this crypto bill is protecting his share shareholders. Okay. So, and of course there's a lot of things here that um it doesn't agree, but the main thing it's this. It's the stable coin yields. They you cannot have stable coins parked on Coinbase or Robin Wood or whatever and receive a yield. The banks don't want that. Okay? And you need we need to understand why the banks doesn't want this. Okay? You are talking from for the banks that have like reser fractional reserves. Sorry, fractional reserver banking and they offer you like 0.1 to 0.3 maybe 1% yield on your deposits and when you go to the stable coins they are offering four six maybe more and they are fully backed they are fully collateralized by T bills or real USD so this is a major issue for the banks this is a major issue for the banks and this is what we need to understand that's happening right now and Brian really talks about this. So, let's let's just listen to him. >> Got the Genius Act passed into law, which actually did enable uh stable coin rewards to happen. Um, you know, the banks had their own concerns and we reached a good outcome in the Genius Act. And now the banks really are coming and trying to undermine the president's crypto agenda. I mean, these are the same banks that, you know, debanked his him and his family, right? and they want to come in and say >> so like I was saying he's saying that the banks are undermining the agenda the the crypto bill and I don't know if this is true or not we know there's a lot of theater there's a lot of things that we don't know but I know what happened this night and what happened this night is quite serious for us um because look at this the white house is considering pulling its support from uh the crypto market structure bill. They don't like it what Coinbase did. Okay? So, we need to understand that this is one of the the promises from Trump. This is one of the things that Trump promised and no one liked what Coinbase did here. Okay? And there's an endgame for this. I'm tell my opinion there's an endgame for this. And I want to understand I want to explain you today what's the endgame for this. So, but the White House saying this and that they didn't like what Brian Armstrong did did. It's a big thing. Okay, it's big. It's not something small and you need to understand this because we are in an eery that needs clarity and we are finally close to get that clarity. Something happens. So, we need to really pay attention to this and to what's happening and yeah, this is not a good thing. Like they said, this is the President Trump bill, not Brian Armstrong bill. That's what they are saying. So this is quite worrisome for for the bill. Okay, that we might not see it approved or even get to a vote, whatever. So we need to understand that no one agrees with Brian, okay? No one agrees with Coinbase. There are a few people from X whatever that they might agree. those that are acting and working with together with everyone for the bill to pass, they don't agree with them. And this is big uh because we have the Robin Hood CEO going against this. We have Brad Garlinghouse from Ripple saying this. Clarity is always better than chaos and the industry needs clarity. Perfection I think in my experience like is the market structure bill that's pending in the banking committee is it perfect? No, certainly not. But is it better than nothing? Absolutely. And I think uh we need to continue to work constructively with Washington to get and continue iterate what is already sitting in front of the banking committee to make it better. But we shouldn't give up now. We are so close. >> So I want to know your opinion. Do you agree with him? Do you agree that it's better to have a bill than having no bill? Or do you think we should have no bill at all? We need to understand something. This bill helps or protects or validates, whatever you want to call it, mainly altcoins, not Bitcoin, not even Ethereum. Actually, it make them look like Bitcoin in Ethereum from a point from a law point of view. So, I would like to know, do you prefer to have a bill or do you prefer to have no bill at all? Um, in my my opinion that we should have a bill. Uh, we cannot go against the banks. It's impossible. they are here for 100 years and I don't think that um that that they will allow something that will literally take profits from them and take the business from them. So I think we should get something then start to um how can I say this then start to improve the bill but this is just my opinion. Okay. So I think they are trying to fight banks. I think Coinbase is protecting their shareholders, but I don't think that having no bill it's going to be positive positive for the market. Okay, but this is just me. Okay, banks see it as an unfair competition and yeah, like I said, $400 million just from West DC and from on Q3, not on the year on Q3. So, they need to do something about this because this is going to impact their business. So this is something really important that we need to have in mind why it's happening. But I think there's an opportunity here. Okay. And I do believe there's a big opportunity here. And when I tell you about the opportunity, I'm talking about this. So if you are into stocks or X stocks, if you trade stocks on a crypto exchange, this might be a buy the deep opportunity. Okay? And I'll explain why. both Robin Robin Hood and Coin dropped 8% 9% when Coinbase pulled the market when when Coinbase pulled um the the the support from the bill and this might be a really good point to get some exposure to stocks. This might be a very good opportunity and I'm looking at it. I have two buy zones here as you can see. I have it here. I have around $225 and $236 for Coinbase. Uh I will assess that if I see that there's going to be a delay, I'm not going to pull the trigger or I will start to build a position and then I have another one here around 184. Uh in case we get a delay, I think if we get a delay or there is no build at all, uh something we might drop here. So, this is one of the areas that I'm looking for uh regarding coin. Same for for Robin Hood. Okay, Robin Hood dropped more than Coinbase. Um, it's coming to a buy area. I want to see what's going to happen and then I'll explain you why. Uh, but these are two my buy areas here. Okay, these are my two buy areas here. And, um, I'm looking at this uh, I'm looking at $92 and I'm looking at $100 for Hobinwood. And I'll explain why. Because I do believe that this bill is going to get approved, but I think we are going to see uh water down approved maybe in July 2026. I think things are going to get delayed. The markup I don't think is going to happen before April. So, we're going to be at the stall and during that time and yeah, that's what I believe uh it's going to happen. So, I think we have time. These are my main areas that I'm looking for. I'm not going to pull the trigger on these two stocks till I have more information what's going to happen and I will update you uh on X at least uh regarding this but these are my main areas because I do believe that this is a by the deep opportunity if we get the clarity act both stocks are going to skyrocket the same way they dropped with the delay if we get the clarity act they are going to uh to skyrocket if if uh we don't get a clarity act, they will drop for sure. And that's why I want to pay attention. That's why I want to be careful with what's happening. And yeah, just for you to be aware of this. Um, I think [clears throat] that there might be an opportunity here. So, um, I'm looking at it on this side. Okay. I want to get some exposure to crypto stocks and I think they're going to run hard uh if we get the Clarity Act approved. So uh but this is what I'm uh what what I'm looking for and regarding the market right now uh just to give you a quick update in in my view about the market and what's happening right now on Bitcoin. I have these two scenarios here and this is what I'm looking sorry. Yeah. And this is what I'm looking for uh on Bitcoin right now. Um we had a a nice move. Let's be honest. It was a very good move here and it was like we went almost almost broke the resistance uh with conviction 90 90 almost 98 I don't I think we reached 98 on some exchanges and then we are retracting uh it's a pullback it's a healthy one and I do believe we are going to uh reverse around 95 or lower uh 93 uh 400 so this is what I'm looking for for Bitcoin right now I'm just being patient I'm being calm. I'm just watching and see um where Bitcoin is heading. And so this is 100% where I'm looking. We might dip lower. We might get a week. Uh just for you to be aware, this week was yesterday and I draw this uh the day before. We already went there. Uh but I do believe we are going lower. Okay. I do believe we are going lower. I do believe that um we might come here and I would not exclude u this I would not exclude a week here and then we'll see. Um I don't think it's the clarity act. It's just an healthy pullback. I think the clarity act it's just something that affects more more altcoins than um Bitcoin but it always have some sort of impact but this is just we had a nice move then we had a pullback and we had another we had the micro tensions I will not I don't want to talk about it okay I don't want to go for the micro things here I don't want to go for the uh the geopolitical stuff here uh you know what's happening and so we you you need to be aware of that. I already explained how to how to search that to search if something is going to happen. I I can recap that. But for now, this is what I'm seeing for Bitcoin. Nothing major. Uh if we start losing supports, then I'll reassess. Uh but so far so far so good. And I don't see any reasons for to be worried to be honest. So let's move on and talk about Ethereum. Ethereum front runed me. I had a buy here around $3, $3,000 and I I was front runned by like I don't know $20, $50, something like that and decided to go. So, it's consolidating now. I think a pull back to 3,200. Um 3,200 would happen. And I do believe that would happen and that would be healthy. Maybe lower 3,100. That's what I'm looking for. I just want to tell this the market right now it's in some sort of a turning point. And I've been saying this for a lot of time. What we saw this week uh when Bitcoin had that move, I've been saying this while stocks are pumping, we will not see crypto pump. Okay? If you can just choose any stock and it goes uh goes up and you make money, there's no need for investors to look for crypto. you want Bitcoin, Ethereum, whatever. If they just need to go on the stock market and make money, they will not look for crypto. And today to sorry, in this week, we had exactly that happening. We saw the stock market pulling back, Bitcoin and altcoins going up. That happened on Wednesday. That happened before all the drama of the Clarity Act. So, I will stick by this. while stocks are pumping, while commodities are pumping. And if you're not trading commodities, you should be trading commodities. Um, there will be no major moves on crypto. There's no need for people to risk a more volatile asset. And volatility is not risk when they have the stock market pumping. So, you had that sign this week. We saw S&P, NASDAQ, Dow pulling back, and that's when we saw that move and this move for Ethereum. It's the same. That's when we saw it. So you have just in my opinion of course I might be wrong. You just have to be patient. You just need to wait for the market to start cooling down on stocks, cooling down on commodities and then in my opinion of course the rotation is going to happen. And that's already happening. Okay. The Russell 2000 is outperforming S&P 500 for the last 10 days. Russell 2000 is like the altcoin market cap of stocks and it's already outperforming S&P 500 for the last 10 days and that's a sign we might it might take more time. I know everyone wants to make money from one day to another but I'm following my strategy and so far it's being going it's going well. I will be wrong one day. I'm just hoping it's not this time. And I do believe that when we start the stock when we start to see the the stocks pulling back, then then we'll see um then we will see a good move on crypto. That's just my opinion. Let me just look at the comments and let me know where you are watching. I always like to know where my audience is and who is watching and where and I want to know who someone is saying Bitcoin is going to 60K. What do you believe is going to happen for 60k or 100k? Let me know that. I want to know that. I want to know because I love when people are bearish. I really do. Let me know what you what you think what's going to happen first. But this is for Ethereum. I think a pullback is needed. 3,300 3,00 sorry 3,200. Um maybe lower. Uh I I even set an alert here. I want to long Ethereum because I think Ethereum is going to start outperform the market really soon and I want to have this for I'm buying the Ethereum dips. Okay, for me I'm buying the Ethereum dips UK Pakistan. Awesome. Awesome. And I'm buying this dips. Okay, this is just me. Uh you don't have to do what I do, but I'm transparent with you. Transparent with you and I'm I'm buying the dips here. um because I do believe the market is going higher now. Falling XRP. Um this was a trade uh I gave last year. Last year I gave you this trade and it's I'm still on it. Okay, I still have another one for $182. Um and yeah, it was full TP. It's holding pretty well. Okay, I think the clarity act could have uh could have helped with an XRP move because it's an altcoin that will be impacted, but um it's holding support. So, if you want to take a risk and maybe take a weekend trade here that you should not um I will not take this trade just for you to be honest though. To be honest with you, I'm already long on XRP. I have two longs. I'm not going to open another one just with a super tight Sorry. with a super tight stop loss like that stop loss that you know that the major move and you'll be weaked out and you are okay with that and you just do this and that's it. Okay, if you want to do this it's like I would say that 90% of the chance that you're going to get stopped. Okay, 90% of the time that this trade you're going to get stopped, but if you want if you're feeling I need to pull the trigger. It's on a major support. It reacted two times. And so maybe you can take this trade. Okay, maybe you can take this trade. I'm not going to take it. I'm not going to follow it. Um because I'm already long. So I will only worry about XRP if we lose this support here. Okay, if we lose this support here, then I think that XRP is going lower. I still believe or or maybe I have a wish. I would like to see XRP below $2 again. I would like to see $160 per XRP uh so I can get more. Um let's see. XRPs are getting a lot of demands. There's a lot of thing happens, a lot of partnerships. So yeah, we need to check what's going to happen. And yeah, let's see. Maybe it's just a wishful thinking. So this is Solena. Um this trade here, the first one was given here on my Saturday shows. Um it's going well as you can see if you follow this my shows here on Saturday. I gave you this trade here. Um it's going super well. It's awesome. You can see it's on the on the Saturday. So it's going super well. Uh let's see. Solen Solen is one of the it's one of those that are looking really good right now. uh really good right now. Okay. And then we let me see what comment discussion needs to move to new cycle contenders not still shift from five years ago. I want to go on that. I'll get back to that later. But like I was saying, I hope I gave this trade on my Portuguese show. You should follow us. It's a Portuguese crypto. You should go there. I'm live I live stream every day uh in Portuguese. And if you if you are Portuguese or Brazilian or you speak Portuguese, watch it's crypto Portuguese and then you should follow us. So like I was saying, Solena, it's not looking bad here. Um this was a trade I think it was on Thursday uh that I share on the live stream. It was not the best one, but I do believe that Sena might go higher and it look like it wants it wants higher. Okay, it looks like it wants higher. So yeah, just pay attention to Salena. I think so there's a lot of things happening to Salena. I'm not the biggest Solena fan um as you know. Uh but I pay pay attention to this one. Okay, pay attention to this one because I do believe um that Solena wants wants higher really wants higher. So let's see. This is curve. You know curve is [snorts] at the resistance right now. It's fighting with the 40 43 resistance. Uh I think curve is looking it's prime uh to go up. Okay. Um but it's a defy token. You need to understand what curve is. Uh I'm a big believer on curve. I did a video about it and yeah I'm still accumulating to be honest because I think curve at 40 cents is a it's a bargain but right now it's fighting. I still have my alert here for the 47 cents and yeah let's see. Let's see what's going to happen. And so, let me see. Stop chasing dog water coins. I don't know what you're talking about, but maybe because I I chase the right ones, my portfolio is still on green. And yeah, but that's me. I'm not Maybe always chasing the new thing on the market doesn't work. Just saying. So, convex told you Convex is awesome for scalps. And you can see the chart right here. Okay. And if you go and check this, it reacted where I thought it would react. It wants to go higher. Uh be aware of this. Convex is amazing for scalps, but it's also a nightmare. Okay, it looks like it wants to go higher, then someone decides that wants to sell the rewards they get from staking and then dump it. So, be aware of that. I love to trade uh Convex and I think you should look at Convex. uh to trade it because if you are scalping that's awesome. Awesome. It's an awesome one. So yeah, I think that that it's one of those that you should look I want to show you this one because I think we talk about this one here. Let I think I have it here. Let me just check. We talk I think it was almost on my first show here. Yeah. So, I don't know if you remember this talk about Monero and I told I've been in Monero since $100, $120, uh, more or less. And at the moment, I said I was expecting a pullback. I got fronted. Uh, but if you want to see if Monero is the real thing, you need to see Monero pumping while Zcash is pumping. Okay? I love Monero. I I didn't sold Monero um because I do believe it's a a great privacy coin. I want to keep it. At least it's for me. I'm I'm willing to take the risk. It's almost a 7x since my entry. Uh but I want you to understand this, okay? If you want to see if Monero now is the real deal and the market is really looking for Monero, you need to see Monero and Zcash pumping. If not, the only thing are going to see its rotation, nothing else. Okay? You need to understand that if Zcash starts to pump and Monero starts to dump, you are seeing just a rotation from one token to another. When you see both pumping, then you know it's a privacy season. Then you know people are looking for both projects. Okay, just keep this in mind because it will be really helpful to trade Monero. If you are trading Monero, I don't trade Monero. I have my spot back and I'm okay with it. So someone's asking for Dash. Dash boot was another one that had a major pump. Yeah, I would not short now, but this was a good short. I I'm not going to short now on support. Uh that's against the rules. Uh but yeah, maybe short here. If you think the run is over, I don't follow Dash. But if you believe the run is over, maybe on a retest that it might had already done. Maybe that people are have already done. So yeah, uh I will not short now. I will wait then I'll short. Yeah, you see it's at support. It's a it's a it will be a good short but I think it's a a risky one to be honest. I think it's a risky short right here. At least it's just my opinion. What are people actually doing with Monero? The same that are doing with all the other ones. Nothing. Actually, you can there are places where you can transact with Monero. The same way you can transact with Bitcoin or whatever Zcash, etc. What are people doing with Zcash right now? Nothing. Olding. So, I'm having some troubles in my internet. I hope everything is okay. At least here I don't see any any issues um from my side. Now H bar is another trade that I'm that I gave here. Uh and I told you I was doing this trade. So far it's holding support. I'm still on the trade. Just an update and I'll keep this trade going. Okay. Um I will do I will keep this trade going and let it ride because I do believe something is coming for HR. They had a network upgrade and that's something that I do believe it's going to I think something is going to happen. That's like this and I do believe in that. Let me see what more coins are you are you asking. So XRP is going to $1. Yeah, I wouldn't mind that. Uh I wouldn't mind that at all. I wouldn't mind that if uh XRP went to $110. I think that's a bit wishful thinking. Maybe more in the future, but so far so for now I don't see it that so far. So yeah, moving forward, the one that I think you should really pay attention and it's still not at my bias buy area. It's here. It's Avac. Um, Avox has a lot of thing coming. Um, there's a lot of thing happening in Avac and someone just sent the wrong Uh, and I do believe there's a lot of thing there's really good things coming here. Okay, for Avac, it's a chain that I hold, a chain that I follow, and I do believe that things might come. And also, I want to talk about this one. Okay, I want to talk with you about lighter. Uh, I don't know if you if you uh were at the airdrop or not. Um, lighter has been amazing for scalp. I've been scalping on Bitix. You'll have the link in the description. Uh, but lighter is one of those projects that no one believed at the beginning. Uh, the airdrop came a lot of hype with the airdrop. A lot of life changes change. That's what we want. Uh, but pay attention to this one because we might be fighting a bottom here. Okay. On lighter, it's hard to know because there's the airdrop. There's always people dumping if something happens. But we had a major it start to drop a lot as you can see since the the altime might drop I don't know sorry like 50% more or less. So but now it's start may maybe it's fing in the floor. Okay. I know some people are waiting for $150, another people for $160. And I'm just telling you this, this is one of those coins and I had an air drop so I'm covered for any stop- loss that I really want to catch the bottom on the swing trade and I usually don't do swing trades. Okay, I'm just telling you my opinion uh because I I studied lighter. I was on the private beta of lighter and I know some people also from banter was on were on the private beta for lighter and I tested the platform. I do believe that they are going to do something new to the market. Just pay attention to this. Okay, put this token under your radar. It's lighter on Bitonix but the token is lit. Uh they are going to change it. I know uh this was just to avoid the confusion with another token because there were people buying the wrong lighter. I don't know if you were aware of that but I do believe that we might be finding a bottom okay not 100% certain because of anyone can uh decide to sell all the sell all the airrop uh but I do believe in that okay just pay attention to this one um if you want to keep it under the right radar as a good opportunity okay even if it's just for uh 50% move or 100% move I think there's an opportunity here okay and that That's that's my opinion and I'm following that. But again, I got the air drop. If I got any stop, I'm swinging already on lighter uh because I want to catch the bottom. But if I get any stop loss, I'll be covered by the air drop that I received. So this is you want to look at peeping. I can look at peeping. You want to see peeping? Yeah. I don't trade this. Look at this. I know some people are scalping this uh especially in crypto wells my the Portuguese community but look at this. What do you want to do here? I'm not going to touch this. No, I don't want maybe spot if you believe so. But I think I saw something about peeping at the concentration of supply. Uh I'm not sure about that, but I think I saw something like that. And so, yeah, but I'm not going to to trade this. Uh, I don't even know what to tell you looking at this to be honest. I prefer to when I don't understand, I'm out. I'm out. Okay. So, this one I'm completely out. And I know I saw the move. I saw the weeks. I saw the comments and I'm completely out. Yeah, you should put a like on the show for sure. Who wants to look at Paul? Paul is doing layoff. You want to check Paul and I'm the one looking for old coins. Okay, I understand. They changed the name so they might be new. And yeah, [snorts] honestly, I don't know what to tell you. Is that support right now? I didn't know Paul went so lower. I had no idea it went so lower. But yeah, I'm not touching Paul. I saw that they are doing layoffs. They are letting people go. Um I know there was a lot of hype, some partnerships, whatever. But yeah, if you want to go for it, it's a risky one. Like a big risk here. And yeah, honestly, I don't know what to tell you about this. Maybe if you clear this, which I don't know if we will. If we clear this and yeah, if you can clear this here, maybe do like this. Something like this. And this area holds, you can look for a trade here. Okay. But so right now, I won't do anything. Maybe short it. Maybe short it. I would short it. Maybe I'm not taking this trade, but this is something I would see me doing if it was not the weekend. I would definitely do something like this. It's not the best RR, but yeah, if you want. Yeah, it doesn't. Yeah, my trading view is going bananas again. This happened to me this week. Yeah, the the RR is not here. Not even for a short. It's too low. Unless you think it's going lower, but it reacted here. Yeah, the the way I would short this. I wouldn't trade this only like this will be the only scenario where I would be looking to trade Paul. Uh the only one. Okay, this would be the only scenario that I would be looking to trade Paul and no more than that. All right, guys. If you want to trade, I just want to tell you there's a link in the description for B2X and there's this competition happening here that you can join my team. You don't have to be registered with my link, but you can join my team. And we are at $100 price. There's a 4 million $4 million prize pool and right now Crypto Wheels team is in 40 41 place and $102 of price. Let's say like this. So just join us. Um I have the link on my ex and register on betix. If you are register with another link there's no issue. Just join us to the team so that we can get more more people and more from the price pool. We need more volume and just I'm counting counting in every one of you. Okay let's get the the price pool higher for everyone and let me see more matic peeping injective and I'm the one looking for the old coins. [gasps] Okay, I was with the injective. What's happening right now with the injective is going higher. Is the market moving? Okay, let me just check if the when I look at this Bitcoin chart. Okay, so yeah, I like Injective. I met the Injective CEO in Barcelona on a conference and she was really nice. But yeah, they need to they need to do more. They need to do more. They need to how can I say this? They need to [snorts] they need to get more utility on the network. Uh honestly, I don't even know what to tell you here. If it if you want to do something, maybe if it pulls back here. Okay, it's at the resistance right now. If it pull backs here at this area, maybe. Okay, just set an alert. That's something I'm going to do also here. And another one here. Just letting you know that's entering your buy zone. And if it pulls back, yeah, I would enter this trade. Um, yeah, I got the I just did the alert because I want to trade it. Maybe that it's gaining strength again. I don't know. But just one thing when I say I'm going to trade on the weekend just because I got I'm setting alerts, not setting limit orders. Okay, understand the difference because when I get an alert, I'm going to check the chart and I'll see, okay, should I enter or not to trade? If it was during the weekend and I see the setup there, even if I saw the setup there, I'll just set up limit trade and that's it. Weekend, it's different. We know that Trump likes to uh how can I say this? Likes to talk about the markets whatever during the weekend. There are some things that happen in the weekend that we don't like that might affect the market. So, I don't just go blind and place limit orders. Okay. Uh but for injective if it if I receive the alerts um then I'll look at it and I'll start to see what I'm doing and what I will do. Sorry. Yeah, we need some likes. I've been here on the shows. The last one th I gave you they all went bananas and Yeah. >> Sorry. >> Sorry. So like I was saying I I'm sorry, guys. Uh like I was saying, um yeah, just be careful on the weekend. Oh man, not H4. Why don't you like H4? I don't understand why people don't like H4. There's always someone against H4. Guys, before checking my charts, more charts, I want to talk about this because I think this is awesome and I don't know, nobody's doing it. And it's this. Okay, Ren shared this um I believe on Wednesday. No, sorry. Yeah, it was on Wednesday. And this is Jax and you should meet Jax. Jax is something that Bantry is doing is new. It's innovation and I think you should go there and you should see um what the future might look like. And this is something that Bant is really putting the effort on it to be different to differentiate from others. Uh go there, go check. I'm going to leave the link there on the chat. Um, go check J Jack. I think you like J. Uh, I think you'll like every what Jax stands for. And yeah, I think that will be awesome to be honest. Just go there and and just uh check the jacks. I'm not going to show you here because I really want you to go there, but I do believe that this is something different. I do believe this is something that you should look at and I do believe this is something that um how can I say this it's different okay it's AI and you know I'm a big AI user and so I gave you some AI prompts last uh last weekend I have more but there's news coming about that I'm going to have my own English channel soon and so there will be talking more about AI trading AI in crypto and but yeah go checks okay you should. And this is something that you should support. It's the future. So, it's what it is. One day, I'll be on the beach drinking margaritas and you'll be seeing someone like me here on the live streams. On the live streams. I'm joking. I'm not going to do that because I don't drink alcohol. That's the only part. I'm not going to do it. So, let's check more charts and see u where I going. H bar legit. Thank you. Someone's saying good things about H bar. Um, thank you. Thank you. I know there will be some H bar. There are two things I know that at least I'm trying. First, I know Jax one day will say something good about XRP and H bar, but first you need Ren to say something good about XRP and H4. So, and I told you there's no bull bull run resuming till Rand says something positive about H4. So till there we are just ranging with fake pumps just to make everyone with with hope and then it dumps. It's what it is. If Ren doesn't say something good about XRP and H bar, there's no bull market to anyone. [cough] Let me see more. So let me see if we have more here. Yeah, I want to talk about is ECP ECP. Yeah, ICP or ECP whatever internet computer it's pumping again. Okay, in this time I didn't saw any major uh how can I say this accounts talking about it. Okay, just it just start pumping randomly. So I would you see this here? I would be paying attention to this area here. Okay. Um, and we'll set an alert here when it's entering your this area here to see how it reacts. Okay. Uh, I do believe that we might see something regarding XR uh, sorry, ICP. Um, a move like this. I wouldn't be surprised to get something like this. Honestly, this wouldn't surprise me at all. Okay. Uh, I don't know, but this wouldn't surprise me at all. So yeah, that might happen. And be aware of this because I know ICP when it pumps, it pumps really hard. Okay, it pumps really hard. So uh I don't know, maybe you can ask Ren to uh Jack and then Jax to do a deep dive on ICP. That would be cool to know Jack's opinion on ICP. And yeah, I think that would be pretty awesome. Let me check if I can tell you more because I think there are good opportunities here on the market that I really want to share with you. But it's weekend. I There will be weekly shows maybe on X. So, let me see. Mooding. [laughter] You You guys really like meme coins? Mang. What do you want me to say about Mooding? That was the the EO one, right? Mooding. Was the EO one? I'm not sure. I think it was the EO one. Ah, [gasps] it's this one. This is mooding, right? Might have found the bottom. Who knows? [gasps] Look, I'll be honest with you. I'm not the biggest meme. [snorts] Not I'm not the big a meme fan or a meme trader, okay? Unless the chart says me tells me that, okay, there's an opportunity here. But yeah, maybe it found the bottom here. I don't know. The thing with memecoins is that there's always someone ready to dump and yeah I don't know if I if I wanted to talk to you about this one I had to see onchain or the accumulation or if there are a lot of concentration of supply a lot of things so before I tell look yeah we might have found the bottom maybe maybe are going to fill the week we are so close um the difference not that much like 2 cents or something but I don't regarding meme coins. I need to see everything uh before I talk about it. Um I just hope you're not overexposed and if you are that we have a huge God candle. Uh but this is just me. I'm not a big a big memecoin trader or believer. So that's what it is. Maybe Pepe. I don't mind trading Pepe. Dodge. Uh I have Dodge. I do believe Dodge is going um somewhere. There's something I do believe is going to happen with Dodge, but that's just it's written on a message that I said what's going to happen and if it does happen uh I'll show to everyone. But so till then I'm not going to tell this to anyone. Even Dodge might might be find finding a support here but it's weakened. So I'll be careful here. I would be really careful here. So let me see. Okay, more. Right, guys, I'm going to wrap this up. Like I said, there's a big drama uh because of the clarity act. Remember, Coinbase is a crypto bank. They do a lot of money from stable coin heels. Uh my prediction and my opinion what's going to happen? We are going to have a clarity act by July. I think by July of 2026, we going to get the clarity act. This is just drama theater to how can I say this? Get this bill a little bit uh softer. Let's select this. Um and there will be a lot of discussions etc. some compromises. I don't believe banks will uh I am missing the word in English. Sorry. I don't believe banks will allow them to have a lot of yields on stable coins. Maybe they'll match the bank ones and that's something they can compromise. Instead of giving 4% 7% they will match the bank ones. The yields from banks. Um that's something that might I see it happen. But you need to understand something. Coinbase is just one exchange. One exchange. Okay. There's a lot of ones that that want this to go for move forward. And don't ignore Ripple and Robin Hood lobby on Washington. Okay, these two they are really big. So I do believe we are going to get the clarity act. Till then there I think there's just be more drama, more theater, more negotiations. Uh the White House wants the bill. That's why they are saying they are pulling the support because of what of what Coinbase did. So yeah, this is just my takeaway what the end game will be. drama, discussions, volatility, but in the end, we are going to get a bill. We are going to get clarity, and that's something that the market needs um from a legal point of view. Thank you for being here. See you all next Saturday.",
