  "transcript": "together between gold and Bitcoin, you have this wonderful store of value trade that is really, really important because if you've held gold for the last 10 years, you've done pretty well by 260%. You held the S&P, you're up about 300, but the dollar has decreased in purchasing value by over a third. If you've held Bitcoin for that period of time, you're up over 11,000%. So, that juice is really, really important if you want to beat inflation over the long term. >> Huge news today. Crypto holders breaking. US cryptosar David Saxs met with lawmakers to discuss the crypto market structure bill this morning. This is what you need to know. David Saxs serving as the White House AI Cryptozar was spotted exiting the office of Senator Tim Scott where a dozen senators had gathered to discuss the Clarity Act, a proposed crypto market structure bill. The bill's markup is expected to take place later this month. Congress is expected to take the next steps on the crypto market structure bill later this month. The Clarity Act is hugely important for the future of this space. And regarding the next steps, if you're unfamiliar with a bill markup, a bill markup in the US Congress is a crucial committee session where lawmakers debate, amend, and rewrite proposed legislation before it goes to the full chamber, allowing changes to the text, adding or deleting provisions, and shaping the bill's final form through votes and amendments. This process is key to building consensus, refining policy, and determining if a bill advances, often involving the committee chair presenting a chair's mark at the starting text. So, we are hoping that this bill gets passed into law in Q1 or Q2 of this year. The delay right now is being reported as something that's largely political with Democrats reluctant to advance the bill ahead of the 2026 midterm elections over concerns over Trump's involvement in cryptoreated ventures. Also, apparently the banks are trying to relitigate stable coin yield which was already decided during the stable coin genius act. So, it's a big question whether the crypto market structure bill advances this year. Everybody is all hands on deck to try to get this to advance. You know, David Saxs is somebody who gets the importance of this technology and he's explaining the importance of this technology not only to Trump but to Washington to to everybody who needs to know. >> The thing that like all these like critics don't seem to understand is the technology. That's the common denominator. Whether it's like Howard Marx or Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger or whoever, they're they're all like great investors or whatever, but they're not technologists. And blind spot. It's a blind spot. And the thing they don't understand about the technology is that Bitcoin is the first digital asset to ever be created that you can't create infinite copies of, right? So, think about like a song or a photo or a video, whatever. Anything that's digital, you've always been able to make an infinite number of copies. Isn't that what the word digital means? Is that infinitely copyable? So, how do you have digital money that can't just be infinitely copied? Obviously, that would destroy the value. And that was the genius of Bitcoin is that every transaction is written into this ledger. The blockchain is decentralized and nobody over the last decade or so has figured out how to counterfeit Bitcoin, how to make a duplicate, how to double spend Bitcoin. >> And the Clarity Act specifically is so important, not even so much to Bitcoin, but for Ethereum, for XRP, for the greater crypto blockchain space, cuz you know, the US has big plans for different select altcoins as well. I've seen reports that it might have, for example, 50,000 ETH, which is Ethereum. When we figure out exactly what the assets are, we're going to move them into the digital stockpile. The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship. It's a place for safekeeping. It's a centralized, you could say, account under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the values of these holdings. >> So, 2026 has started off strong, although choppy. Right now, we're still above 90,000. But take a look at what smart money is doing. Take a look at this metric. Ethereum balance by holder value. Follow the smart money. Buy more Ethereum. This is happening with Bitcoin Ethereum quality crypto assets right now. Also, very similarly to what we saw before the spot ETFs were approved in 2024, before the Stable Coin Genius Act was put into law in 2025. We're seeing the biggest players get their ducks in a row and and really acting like the Clarity Act is soon to be passed. bullish. Grayscale's Ethereum staking ETF becomes the first spot crypto ETF to distribute staking rewards. They wouldn't be doing this unless they had some sort of certainty that the Clarity Act will be passing relatively soon. And today, the Grayscale Ethereum [music] staking ETF became the first spot Ethereum ETP to distribute staking rewards to shareholders in the US. The crypto asset manager announced today that the Grayscale Ethereum staking ETF made a distribution to [music] existing shareholders. The proceeds came from the sale of staking rewards earned by the fund between October 6th and December 31st, 2025. Now, as of market open, that represents more than $9.4 million in [music] total staking rewards being distributed to investors. This is Coinbase's head of institutional strategy. So he's in charge of heading up the team that actively talks to different institutions partnering with Coinbase or interested in buying crypto or getting involved with blockchain technology as a whole. Like he is an insider. So it's really interesting to hear what's going on in these insider conversations. >> Tell us more about what's happening right now in terms of institutional buying. what you're seeing in terms of either corporates, sovereigns, some of the big guys in terms of what their plans are for this year to the extent that they've shared them with you and what you thought the plans were going to be last year because there was a big view I don't know about halfway through the year that there was going to be sort of a huge push in and I don't know if the full push came. So it did and it is and this is sort of what's been frustrating for those of us who work on the institutional side for the last six, seven months has been the delta between retail negative sentiment and institutional and regulatory momentum. So we look back at last year and I must have been on 20 shows talking about how bad Bitcoin was doing. Net net down 6% for the entire year. This is an asset that's been the best performing asset by far by by by a mile. It's been the good nine out of 12 years. So institutions understood that. So I don't know a single institution that was putting in the work on crypto and Bitcoin last year that stopped because the asset experienced quite frankly typical volatility and was down 6%. >> There was nobody who paused or said to you early in the year, you know, we're thinking of going this direction. We're going to do this and then called you up and said, you know what, we're going to wait till 26 and see where things are. >> On the institutional side, no. If anything, the rapidly increasing regulatory momentum moved them faster. I think today versus a year ago, I don't know of a single large company that doesn't have an AI and blockchain strategy or at least thinking of one. >> Right. And my question is the ones that are thinking, >> did anybody slow down on the thinking >> on the institutional side? >> No. And are you surprised then that the value of Bitcoin didn't I mean g given what would have been the inflows from the institutional folks >> that you didn't see I mean obviously instead of it going up which it did for a period >> it obviously went the other direction at a time when you did have this big influx and so what what should we take away from that >> well again during that period of time you had massive ETF outflow so what I saw was retail panicking and institutional providing that support buffer and foundation for that price not to go even lower and now we're seeing retail returning. ETF inflows have been massive 520 million or so over the last 7 days and now we're seeing price respond accordingly >> because JP Morgan's involved with Bitcoin now, right? >> Well, not just I mean every every major bank is developing a blockchain. I don't know of anyone at a senior level in any of these institutions and we're talking to all of them. I mean there's been some major announcements >> that think Bitcoin's going to zero. You don't think it >> if you if you if you think that now at at a partner level, you're keeping your mouth shut cuz it's a bit embarrassing. >> Hey, make sure you subscribe to Altcoin Daily.

In this case, Cryptobillionaire reveals a crazy story of how in 2020 he paid 4.5 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett. And he told Warren, \"Invest in Tesla, invest in Bitcoin.\" This is from the School of Hard Knocks YouTube channel. He interviews millionaires and billionaires. This is Justin Sun, the CEO and founder of Tron Crypto. 6,000 likes so far. I'll leave you with this. My name is Aaron Altcoin Daily. Make sure you subscribe. Can you tell me a crazy business story? >> Yes, of course. So, I have lunch with Warren Buffett. >> You had lunch with Warren Buffet? >> Yes. Yes. 2020. >> How did you get a lunch with Warren Buffet? >> $4.5 million. >> So, you paid 4.5 million to get a lunch with Warren Buffet? >> Yes. Yes. >> And was it worth it? >> Yes. It's totally worth it. >> What did Warren Buffet teach you in that lunch? He said, \"Be careful with the one you marry. You need to make this decision like really hard.\" >> Warren Buffet of course told you. >> Yes. And I tell him to invest Tesla and Bitcoin. >> Do you own a lot of Bitcoin? >> Yes. I personally have a lot. >> Why are you telling Warren Buffet to invest in Bitcoin? >> The reason is because Tesla and Bitcoin is building something new. So never ever exist on earth before. So that's very important because in the capital markets we always give premium to new companies to new innovations rather than you know keep manufacturing the things we have been manufacturing for thousands of years. So that's why I tell Warren Buffett Tesla Bitcoin is definitely the bad and also the reason Warren Buffett told me not to hold Bitcoin is the reason I invest in Bitcoin. Crypto and the blockchain is the money for the internet. Basically AI and internet won't understand the traditional finance. They won't understand the dollar, you know, we invented um basically 100 years ago. Now they will understand Bitcoin and all the cryptocurrency because it's created by the machine language and created by computers. So better getting up.",
