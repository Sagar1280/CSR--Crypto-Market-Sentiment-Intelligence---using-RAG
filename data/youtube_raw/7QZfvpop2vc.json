  "transcript": "While everyone in the crypto space obsesses over \nthe Federal Reserve and Jerome Pal's next rate   cut, something much bigger is brewing on the other \nside of the world. China, which famously banned   Bitcoin mining and trading back in 2021, just \nquietly turned on the money printer. Reports are   circulating of a massive liquidity injection, \nsome claiming as high as $1.5 trillion worth,   aimed at jumpstarting the Chinese economy. \nAnd history shows that when China prints,   crypto pumps. But is this stimulus actually real? \nIs China secretly buying Bitcoin? And could the   next bull run actually be made in China? Well, \nthis is exactly what we're going to find out.   My name is Guy and you're watching the Coin \nBureau. But before we dive into the data, you   need to know that I am not a financial adviser. \nNothing in this video is financial or investment   advice. This is purely for educational purposes to \nhelp you separate the FUD from the facts. If that   sounds reasonable, prove it by smashing that like \nbutton like a central banker smashing the print   command. And let's get into it. So, if you've been \non crypto Twitter recently, you've likely seen the   headlines. China injects $1.5 trillion. China \nto buy 1 million Bitcoin. It sounds incredible   and like the catalyst we've all been waiting for. \nBut whenever numbers this big get thrown around,   we have to pause and look at the actual data. \nSo, let's start with that liquidity injection.   The rumor mill claims China is injecting $1.5 \ntrillion US worth of liquidity into its economy.   But here is where things get rather tricky. Other \nreports site a figure of 1.05 trillion yuan. Now,   for those of you who skipped maths class, at the \ncurrent exchange rate, 1.05 05 trillion yuan is   roughly 146 billion US. That is a pretty massive \ndifference. One is a market moving bazooka. The   other is your bog standard water pistol. So which \nis it? Well logically you have to look at what the   People's Bank of China or PBOC is actually doing. \nIn late 2024 and early 2025 they announced cuts to   the reserve requirement ratio or RR. basically the \namount of cash banks need to keep in their vaults.   These cuts release about $1 trillion yuan or $140 \nbillion of long-term liquidity each time. So the   $1.5 trillion headline you're seeing that appears \nto be a conflation of multiple policy measures,   potential stock market lending facilities, and \npure opium. It is not a single check being written   to the Chinese people. And then there's the rumor \nabout China buying 1 million Bitcoin. This claim   surfaced just a few days ago, allegedly from Panta \nCapital. But when we dug into the sources, we   couldn't find a single verified report, official \nstatement, or indeed any corroborating piece of   evidence from major financial publications. Just \na single report from a niche news outlet. From   our perspective, until we see a wallet address \nor an official statement, this is nothing more   than opium. But just because the headlines are \nexaggerated doesn't mean the thesis is wrong.   Because while the retail floodgates might be \nclosed, the institutional backdoor is being   prized open. You may have heard talk about the \nHong Kong ETFs as the gateway for Chinese capital.   When the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launched \nin Hong Kong in April 2024, the narrative was that   mainland Chinese investors would pour billions in \nvia the Stock Connect program. But then the ETFs   launched and the volume was frankly underwhelming. \nWhy? Because the Stock Connect program does not   currently allow mainlanders to buy crypto ETFs. \nThey're explicitly blocked. So game over for the   China narrative then, right? Well, not so fast. \nWhile retail is blocked, there is a massive pool   of capital that is quietly getting the green \nlight. I'm talking about the insurance sector.   The Hong Kong Insurance Authority is proposing \nnew rules that would allow insurance companies   to allocate capital into digital assets. \nWe're talking about an industry with roughly   $82 billion in gross premiums annually. Even a \n1% allocation from this sector would dwarf the   retail inflows we've seen so far. And here is the \ntwist. Many of these insurers are subsidiaries of   massive mainland Chinese conglomerates. So \nthis creates a legal regulated structure for   mainland institutional capital to gain exposure to \ncrypto assets without violating Beijing's capital   controls. It's not a retail tsunami so much as an \ninstitutional iceberg. And now let's talk about   the charts. Most crypto investors are glued to the \nUS federal funds rate, watching every word Jerome   Powell says. But if you look at the historical \ndata, Bitcoin's price actually has a much tighter   correlation with something else entirely. The \nChinese 10-year government bond yield. I know   bond yields sound about as exciting as watching \npaint dry, but stick with me. According to   analysis from researchers like TechDev, local tops \nin the Chinese 10-year yield often align perfectly   with Bitcoin impulse peaks. Why would this be? \nWell, it comes down to global liquidity. When   China stimulates, they expand their money supply \nor M2. And research shows that Bitcoin has a 94%   correlation with global liquidity over the long \nterm. Currently, the US Fed is cutting rates. Yes,   but China is in a unique position. Their economy \nis struggling with deflation and a real estate   crisis. They have no choice but to keep liquidity \nloose. While the Fed is trying to stick to a   soft landing, China is trying to prevent a crash \nlanding. And historically, when the East turns on   the liquidity taps, Bitcoin tends to float higher. \nIn fact, the 30-day correlation between the PBOC's   balance sheet expansion and Bitcoin currently \nsits at around 0.66. That is a statistically   significant relationship. Simply put, you might \nbe watching the wrong central bank. But liquidity   isn't the only thing coming out of China. Remember \nthe 2021 Bitcoin mining ban when China kicked   out all the Bitcoin miners and the hash rate \ncollapsed? Well, take a look at this. According   to recent data, China has quietly climbed back to \ncontrol roughly 14 to 20% of the global Bitcoin   hash rate. But wait a minute, if mining is banned, \nhow is this possible? Well, it turns out that   banned in China often just means don't get caught. \nBut there is a new narrative emerging that's even   more interesting. Many of these mining operations \nare reportedly disguising themselves as AI compute   centers. or they're operating under the umbrella \nof state-owned enterprises looking to monetize   excess energy from hydroelectric dams in places \nlike Sichuan and Shing Jang. Think about it. China   has massive overcapacity in energy infrastructure. \nBitcoin mining is the most efficient buyer of last   resort for that energy. So while the government \npublicly condemns crypto privately, it seems like   they're happy to let state linked entities capture \nthe revenue. So this isn't a resurgence of retail   miners. This looks like industrial-grade state \ntolerated accumulation of hash rate. And speaking   of accumulation, if you want to know what the \nsmart money in Asia is doing, you have to look   at the whales. And there is no whale quite as \nvisible or controversial as Justin Sun. Love   him or hate him, the founder of Tron, is often \na proxy for eastern capital flows. And recently,   Sun has been positioning himself aggressively. \nHe's invested heavily in projects linked to the   US political landscape, bridging the gap between \nAsian capital and Western regulatory hopes. But   beyond just one man, take a look at the exchange \ndata. Trading volumes in the APAC region have   surged 69% year-over-year. The Bitcoin exchange \nreserve ratio, which compares US-based exchanges   to offshore exchanges, shows a clear flow of \ncapital moving east. The coins are leaving   Coinbase and heading to Binance, OKX, and Bybit. \nThis suggests that while American institutions   are buying the ETFs, the actual liquid supply of \nBitcoin is increasingly being cornered by Asian   traders and entities. It's a massive transfer of \nwealth from west to east happening right under our   noses. Now, I know what you're thinking. Guy, this \nall sounds incredibly bullish. Should I reorggage   my house? No, please don't. Because we have to \nlook at the other side of the coin. The good news   is that China's economic instability, specifically \nthe collapse of their real estate market,   creates a massive incentive for capital flight. \nChinese citizens are sitting on a record 160   trillion yuan in household savings. With property \nprices falling and the stock market volatile,   Bitcoin is the only asset that can truly get \ncapital out of the system. This is the flight   to safety thesis. But here's the bad news. \nIf the Chinese economy deteriorates too fast,   we could see a liquidity crunch. When people \nare broke, they sell their most liquid assets   first. And crypto is liquid 24/7. Furthermore, the \nChinese government is sitting on a massive pile   of seized crypto, estimated at nearly 200,000 \nBTC from the Plus token seizure years ago. If   they need to plug a budget hole, if they need to \nbail out a developer like Vanie or Country Garden,   then they have a $12 billion piggy bank they can \nsmash open at any time. And selling that into the   market would not be nice for price action. So, \nwhile the stimulus is bullish, the desperation   that causes the stimulus is a double-edged sword. \nSo, to sum up then, is the next bull run going to   be made in China? Well, from our perspective, \nthe answer is yes, but not in the way you might   think. It won't be a flood of retail traders \nbuying Dogecoin on WeChat like in 2017. That   era is over. This cycle is about quiet, state \ntolerated mining. Institutional capital flowing   through Hong Kong insurance products and a \ndesperate need to hedge against a falling   real estate market. The liquidity is real. The \ncorrelation is real. And while the headlines about   $1.5 trillion checks might be fake, the impact on \nBitcoin's price is undeniable. Bitcoin is a global   asset. And right now, the wind is blowing from \nthe east.
