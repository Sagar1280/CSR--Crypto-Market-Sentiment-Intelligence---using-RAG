  "transcript": "On paper, America has never looked richer. Stocks at all-time highs. Home prices near or at all-time highs. A government spending trillions to [music] keep the illusion alive. But here's the question no one asks. What if the crash already happened and we just measured it in the wrong unit? >> Now look, stocks are down 70% priced in gold already if you go back to the year 2000. And so, you know, we're already seeing this major decline in the real value of US stocks. It's just that, you know, the nominal price doesn't go down because we keep printing dollars. That's Peter Schiff, CEO and chief global strategist of Europacific Capital, founder and chairman of Schiff Gold and one of the loudest voices on hard money in the last two decades, including predicting the 2007208 crisis on TV while most people mocked him. Now, quick context before we jump in, guys. I brought Peter on because I do think he's right about a lot of the macro setup and I absolutely believe in precious metals and I do think that they have a place in serious portfolios, but I'm not aligned with him on [music] Bitcoin. And in this conversation, avoiding Bitcoin was basically impossible because Peter kept bringing it up. So, what you're about to watch is two things at once. one, his core macro thesis for why the dollar system is weakening, and two, a very direct collision between gold and Bitcoin with zero fluff. Because according to Schiff, this isn't volatility. It isn't a cycle. It's a stealth collapse covered up by the very currency used to measure it. And when the foundation starts to rot, the playbook is always the same. Print more money. what the Fed just announced with its most recent uh interest rate cut uh was a return to quantitative easing. Now, they didn't officially say it's quantitative easing, >> but it's a distinction without a difference. What the Fed said they were going to do is start printing money to buy T bills. If Peter is right, the next crisis won't look like 2008. It'll look like a slow motion unraveling. The dollar weakens, assets pretend to rise, and purchasing power disappears without a headline that says crash. And he thinks that it ends with something bigger than a recession, a reset. That's going to be the next major monetary reset in the world is going to be the ddollarization. And that has profound implications uh for the US and for the rest of the world. It's going to be very positive in my opinion for the rest of the world because I think the dollar uh reserve system has worked against the world and has worked in favor of the US and I think the ending of this situation is going to be a boom outside the United States and a big bust inside the United States. Gold rising, the world repricing around hard assets and the US trying to print its way out of gravity which brings us to the moment I know that a lot of you have been waiting for. So, I'm curious though, what are your targets for in 2026 for both Bitcoin and gold and silver? >> Well, you know, I've been saying I think gold's going to at least hit. >> Stay locked in because by the end of this episode, you'll have Shift's 2026 targets for gold and silver, his full silent crash argument, and you'll hear exactly where I agree with him and where I think he's dead wrong. Drop a comment. Are you with Schiff on this, or is he missing something big? And if you're team Bitcoin, I want you to listen to his macro case first before you roast him. And again, remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. All right, guys. Without further ado, let's bring Peter [music] onto the stage. Peter, welcome to the show. It's good to have you here. Uh, thanks for thanks for being here. >> Oh, my pleasure. Thanks for having me on. So, Peter, I want to get into just a little bit about uh where we are in the system right now. And you've been talking about this, you know, huge crash that we're supposed to have for over a decade. And uh we haven't had it yet in the, you know, overall economy and the markets and things like that. Uh what do you think is what do we think is going on there? >> Well, when you when you're talking about a huge crash, what what are you referring to? Well, I mean, I guess the same thing. Do you not agree with someone like Robert Kiyosaki who says we're going to have this kind of massive, you know, Great Depression style crash? >> Well, I mean, we're not going to have a Great Depression style crash because we're not on a gold standard anymore like we were during the Great Depression. But I think that if you measure the price of stocks in terms of gold, we could absolutely see a decline of that magnitude, which is something like 90% decline uh in the value of stocks. Now look, stocks are down 70% priced in gold already if you go back to the year 2000. So, you know, we're already seeing this major decline in the real value of US stocks. It's just that, you know, the nominal price doesn't go down because we keep printing dollars. And in fact, what the Fed just announced with its most recent uh interest rate cut uh was a return to quantitative easing. Now, they didn't officially say it's quantitative easing, >> but it's a distinction without a difference. What the Fed said they were going to do is start printing money to buy T bills. So, with quantitative easing, they were printing money to buy Treasury bonds. Now they're printing money to buy Treasury bills, but it's only a matter of time before they go up, you know, the yield curve in duration. But the fact of the matter is the Fed is trying to lower interest rates. And in order to do that, it has to print more money to artificially suppress rates so it can take the money is printing and go into the Treasury market and buy up these bills to to to push down uh down down down the price. So, uh, eventually there's going to be a dollar crisis as a result of all this and so the dollar is going to go way down. Stocks may not go down in terms of dollars, but if the dollar loses half its value against other currencies and the stock market goes up 10%, that's a 40% decline in terms of those other currencies. And of course, if the gold doubles again uh from where it is, which you know would put it around $8,500 an ounce if gold were to double from here, that's another 50% decline in the stock market value, even if the stock market, you know, stays the same. And of course, now look at silver. I mean, silver is now over 50 63, excuse me, $63 an ounce. Silver is more than doubled on the year. uh so priced in in silver um the the US market is getting killed. So in that respect I agree you know that the US stock market's going down but it's not going to go down the way it did in the 1930s because we're not on the same monetary system that we were during the 1930s. During the 1930s the dollar gain value uh you know prices went down by about 30%. So you could buy more with your dollars. You could buy more of everything, including more stocks and more real estate. But [clears throat] today, the dollar is going to lose a lot of value. In fact, the only thing that you'll be able to buy more of with your dollar is Bitcoin. >> Yeah. Uh yeah, we'll get we'll get to that a little bit later. [laughter] I I am curious though. Uh what do you do you consider copper a precious metal? Do you do you >> No, Copper Copper is a is an industrial metal. >> Yeah. uh it's it's it's not a precious metal. Um but copper prices are headed higher now. Copper prices are very low right now in terms of gold. That's true with a lot of metals and things like energy. Oil is very cheap right now in terms of gold. Uh now I think copper prices and oil prices are going to rise uh in terms of gold uh because I think they're just too cheap. And so that's going to change and that's going to be, you know, compound the the problem for the Fed because those prices are going to bleed into the CPI, you know, more so than the rising gold price. I mean, I don't even know if jewelry or any of that stuff is even factored into the CPI. Uh, but when co copper prices are going to have a much more impact and obviously energy prices. >> Yeah, that's exactly why I was asking just because they need so much copper for all this energy demand that we have now. >> Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, although there is some a lot of industrial use for silver, so that's got to impact the CPI. I mean, silver prices are just on fire. They go up every day. You know, we're up another 2.5% today almost at $63.50 for an ounce of silver. You know, that when the year began, silver was $30 or under. It might have been I think it was slightly under 30. So [clears throat] we we have seen this you know meteor this huge gain in in gold over the past uh I mean especially I would say over 2025 right that's when it kind of really started to take off 2024 2025 >> January 2024 is when gold started to take off silver didn't start to take off till this year >> but gold took gold moved up at the end of of uh of 2024 and in fact at the beginning of 2024 but it had a selloff at the end after Donald Trump got elected and silver sold off even more and the ratio got to 100 to1. Actually, you you were able to buy more than 100 ounces of silver for an ounce of gold. Right now, it's about 67. So, silver has obviously had a huge rally off those lows. >> Do you think that the reason that that gold has gone up so much is because of the BRICS countries and what they just announced with the unit? No, it's well I think a lot of it is foreign central banks that have been buying uh and so that those would in include uh brick uh central banks. Uh but it it's clear that the the world is moving away from the dollar and so if they're moving away from the dollar they have to be moving towards something else and what they are moving to is gold. Right? So it's not a major move out of the dollar into the euro or into the yen or the pound or you know it's gold. gold is the beneficiary of these flows out of the US dollar and that also means that money is coming out of treasuries or money that would have gone into treasuries isn't going into treasuries because it's going into gold instead. And I think the big change for 2026 is going to be that the central banks not only continue to buy gold, but they buy more. and some of the central banks that hadn't, you know, taken the plunge yet, they're they're going to they're going to they're going to see what's happening and they're going to see, you know, how well the gold is performing for the other central banks that have been buying it and they're going to realize that they need to buy it too. But the other the big difference is going to be I think in 2026 that's when the private investors who were selling a lot of gold in 2024 uh and most of 2025 they're going to start to be big buyers. You know uh institutional investors which would be uh pension funds, endowments, hedge funds. uh you know they're going to start allocating some of their portfolio to gold where they have no allocation now and not just physical gold but gold mining stocks and I think the retail investor who has really kind of just been focused on tech stocks or crypto certainly in America right I think that money is going to start flowing back into gold I think as the air comes out of the AI bubble uh and the meme stock bubbles uh I think that uh mining stocks are going to be very appealing to people who are looking for big gains because they've already delivered huge gains this year. Uh and but they're still cheap. And I think a lot of the money, the Wall Street money that got into Bitcoin last year and this year as a result of all the hype that surrounded the launching of all the Bitcoin ETFs and then the election of a Bitcoin president and the Bitcoin strategic reserve and all that stuff. I think a lot of that money is going to go back to gold because I think a lot of it came out of gold, right? wasn't a coincidence that when all these big inflows were coming into the Bitcoin ETFs that we were seeing big outflows from the gold ETFs and gold mining stock ETFs. So this, you know, is is kind of hot money. You know, that the people that own these ETFs, they're not the same type of people that were, you know, at the Bitcoin conference, you know, there in Abu Dhabi or the one I was at in Dubai. And you know, you're not they're not your Bitcoin maxis who are holding, you know, their Bitcoin in their uh private keys with their own wallets, right? These are people who kind of got into Bitcoin in the last couple years, two, three, so they don't have any gains, you know, and um but they got into it because they expected big gains because they were there was so much hype around, you know, a million-doll Bitcoin or this is the new thing, this is better than gold, this is going to be the fastest horse in the race. Meanwhile, you know, for the last couple years, Bitcoin is the slowest horse in the race. I mean, it's standing still and the other horses are are running way out. And I think people are going to get frustrated by the fact that they're missing out on these huge gains in gold and silver and gold and silver mining stocks that they may have owned in 2022 or 2023, but they got out of them in 2024. They changed horses. They got on the Bitcoin horse because they thought it was going to be faster. And instead, you know, they're on the slowest horse. You know, uh it's not even in the race. It's going in the wrong direction. and and so I think they're gonna they're going to get out. So I think this is going to be a big headwind uh for crypto next year. Uh but it's also going to be part of why you're going to see a bigger rally in in the precious metals. [clears throat] I think [clears throat] I I don't I don't think that a lot of people that got into Bitcoin over the past two to three years did it because they expected the number to go up extremely a bunch. I think that they are likely frontr running what they see uh coming to the world via adoption. So I mean gold has been around for millennia as a store of value as a as a you know some some utility within jewelry making and other things like that but mostly just store of value. So that's been accepted for a long time. Had a long time to mature and a long time. It went through, you know, that that was the kind of decisive play between either China or United States becoming a superpower was the, you know, who was holding the most gold versus silver. And you know, China went and and tried to hold a lot of silver and United States held a lot of gold. There's a big silver deposit found, right? and uh that that skyrocket the price of gold, you know, decrease the price. >> When you say that people aren't buying Bitcoin because they expect the price to go up, I mean, that's just not true. And even if you say it's because they're expecting, you know, more people to buy it, they're expecting more people to buy it, driving up the price. You know, the the people that are buying these gold ETFs, they're not trying to get out of the dollar. They're trying to accumulate more dollars and they're hoping they're going to do that with with these Bitcoin ETFs. They hope the price of Bitcoin goes up so they can sell and get more dollars than they started with. Right? That that that's where this buying is coming from. I I'm differentiating that between, you know, the MC Bitcoin Maxi who's pricing his his net worth in Bitcoin and isn't buying to get crit, you know, get rich quick. he really believes in this thing and and thinks it's the future and and so he's you know he's all in. Uh I I mean I disagree with these guys. They're going to get, you know, their ass handed to them. Uh but I'm talking about the buyers who are likely to jump ship in the next year. I I I think that the diehard Bitcoiners, they're not going to sell their Bitcoin at 50,000 or 30,000. They're going to hold on to it. They may buy more, but you know, a lot of the trading money that is there, they're not going to, you know, they're not going to go down with this ship. They're they're going to have a a mental stop or or an actual stop where they decide to cut and run, right? They're not going to hold on to this uh and, you know, all the way down. They're going to they're going to limit their losses at some point. But what is going to happen though, I think a lot of the uh the Bitcoiners that are not in the ETFs, you know, that got in early, right, that had big gains, right? I'm talking about people who bought, you know, 10 years ago or longer, right? Who bought Bitcoin sub 10,000 or sub 1,000, right? And so they had big gains. I think a lot of those people who had big gains because they didn't want to sell their Bitcoin and realize those gains and pay taxes, but more importantly, they didn't want to miss out on the future gains. So, I think a significant number of those people uh borrowed against their Bitcoin. And so, I think that there's a lot of Bitcoin out there that is collateralized loans. And I think that in these circumstances, those Bitcoiners are going to have no no choice. That Bitcoin is going to get sold and it's going to get sold at a very inopportune time. It's going to get sold after a big drop. And and so we haven't really had that uh situation in the past where instead of buying on the dip, we're going to end up getting massive selling on the dip because the buyer the the holders aren't going to have a choice in the matter. the lenders are going to sell the Bitcoin right out from under them. >> Well, yeah. [clears throat] So, I I think that uh again, like I like I said in the beginning to you before we started recording, I don't I don't I don't think that it makes a lot of sense to continue to argue the Bitcoin versus gold case because I mean, I'm I'm also a huge >> got nothing to do with gold. This is just this is just unique to Bitcoin. Doesn't matter what happens to gold, right? If Bitcoin goes down, there's going to be a lot of lot of forced liquidations. >> Yeah. So I mean for me my belief is that uh we're just in the early days of adoption right you see I mean Bhutan coming on board El Salvador you see Pakistan uh a lot of countries that also want to get uh you know free themselves from the dollar and also see as a as a >> re but the countries that want out of the dollar are buying gold I mean that's why the price of gold has doubled in the last two years and the price of bitcoin has gone down because >> these countries are mining bitcoin and it's a you know they're not having they're not paying their way into gold. >> Yeah, but mining mining Bitcoin and selling Bitcoin and making money as a minor is not adopting Bitcoin. >> No, they're not selling. It's it's generating not selling it. They're not selling it. >> Well, what are they doing with it? >> They're holding it as a as a as a reserve. >> We'll see. Well, somebody's selling it, right? The price the price is going down, >> right? That's that's that was a self-fulfilling prophecy of the four-year cycle which I I believe is just temporary because I don't believe that exists anymore. But back to back to gold and uh the bricks because I've been talking about this for a long time. Can you explain kind of just how that move to gold will actually work in developing this new currency? >> Well, right now it's not a new currency. It's it's about backing their existing currencies with gold more than US dollars. Because you know when you have just a currency, a paper currency, something has to be there to give it value. Something has to back it up. Something has to be the reserve. And a lot of countries have had US dollars as their primary reserve asset. That's what's changing because central banks are recognizing the inherent risk in the dollar. Not just a political risk that you know the US could sanction you and and and kind of rugpull your dollar reserves. Uh but you know inflation the the fact that we have you know massive debt that we can't pay and that we're printing all this money and keeping interest rates artificially low. All that is negative for the dollar. And so central banks don't want to hold a depreciating asset as reserve. And so they are replacing dollars with gold because gold is the best substitute for the dollar because the other fiat currencies are flawed too. Like if you sell your dollars and buy euros, I mean what's so great about the euro? I mean they got plenty of problems in the euro zone too. You know Japan, I mean they got problems there. So gold is the only uh clean shirt that's not in the hamper, right? Everybody was saying that the dollar is the cleanest dirty shirt. I I would argue I don't think it's the cleanest dirty shirt, but I agree that all the shirts are dirty when it comes to currencies. But gold is pristine, right? It's it's it's it's not even near that hamper. So that is the choice. It's not between the dollar and euros. It's between the dollar and gold. And and gold wins hands down. And so people are central banks are buying gold. Now whether the bricks or China or somebody decides to officially back their currency with gold in a where it's pegged to it where you have a defined relationship between the currency and gold and you have a a a you know a convertability at a set rate where a holder of a currency can get an amount of gold. uh that might happen and I know what countries are already doing now and countries like like India uh and China and Russia is they are settling their global trade in gold. So they can trade with one another and they can net out the buys and the sells but they can settle up the differences instead of using US dollars they can use you know gold. Uh and so gold can be a settlement monetary instrument that can replace the dollar. I mean gold is universal. Uh every currency can can look towards gold and and and price their currency against gold. And so gold is basically taking away the role of the dollar. But the dollar took the role away from gold because before the world used the dollar, we used gold. Uh and then when we started using the dollar, it was because the dollar was as good as gold because it was backed by gold and convertible into gold at a fixed rate on demand. And so that that's that's what we had when the Brentton Wood system was launched. And we stayed with that system until 1971 when we defaulted on the commitments to pay gold and we basically went on a pure fiat standard. But the world stayed on the dollar standard even though the US was no longer on the gold standard. The world stayed on this dollar standard and they're still on it. but they are in the process of of of getting off of it and that's going to be the next major monetary reset in the world is going to be the ddollarization and that has profound implications uh for the US and for the rest of the world. It's going to be very positive in my opinion for the rest of the world because I think the dollar uh reserve system has worked against the world and has worked in favor of the US and I think the ending of this situation is going to be a boom outside the United States and a big bust inside the United States. Now how we react to that you know we'll see you know if we if we'll we'll you know put in the right policies. Uh right now it doesn't look that way. Um, but I but investors need to bear this in mind and I know a lot of people in the crypto space that may have similar outlook for the dollar and and share my concerns about uh, you know, what's going to happen. Uh, they're just convinced that this is going to benefit Bitcoin too. That is when when people want to get rid of the dollar, they're going to want to buy Bitcoin instead of dollars. And there's no indication that that's going to be the case. Uh because Bitcoin up until today has traded like a risk asset. Uh not like a safe haven asset. It's if anything, it's negatively correlated with gold. So something that is necessarily good for gold is not necessarily good for Bitcoin. In fact, I would say it's the opposite. I mean, the worst thing or one of the worst things that can happen to Bitcoin is gold keeps going up, silver keeps going up. Because one of the reasons that Bitcoin was able to do so well uh was gold and silver were were not going anywhere. It was when gold and silver were flat going sideways. That's when Bitcoin was able to make a big gain. But now that gold and silver are actually going up, you don't have the reason to buy Bitcoin as an alternative anymore because people are doing very well in in real gold. They don't need to take a chance on on fool's gold. >> [clears throat] >> How are these countries uh that you said are settling in gold actually settling in gold? I mean that it are they physically delivering gold to each other? >> Well, no. Basically, the gold doesn't really get shipped around. They can they can hold the gold uh and and just, you know, assign ownership, right? They can have it in their vaults and they can just say, \"Okay, you got this gold.\" And, you know, they don't have to keep shipping it back and forth because they may have to settle it the other way the following year. It's like a ledger, you know, but China can have some gold in its vaults or Russia can have gold or India can have gold and they can hold gold for each other, you know, so you don't have to physically put it in trucks every time somebody, you know, owes the other, you know, gold just like with just like with dollars. It's not like all these dollars were being put in in in in uh in big bags, duffel bags and just shipped around. They were just, you know, doing it electronically. [clears throat] But to you is a settlement. It's it's you know I don't want to call it a currency because it's actually money but you can settle up in ounces of gold. You know the difference between your imports and your exports because a lot of the bilateral trade you know balances out right you know I buy from you buy from me. It's just that one side is going to have a small surplus with the other side. And so how do you settle that? Right? If I export goods to you and then I import goods from you, but I don't import enough, right? How do we how do you pay the difference? Well, we do it in gold, right? That's how it works. You know, they weren't doing it in dollars, but now now they're going to be more and more doing it in gold because the other side doesn't want dollars, >> right? Don't you think they would prefer to be able to settle in real time with, you know, holding the assets and verifying that they actually have the assets that they're owed? They can they can do that with gold. They're they're perfectly happy to do that. >> Well, no, they can't. Actually, you said they just settle, you know, numbers on a screen and then eventually they settle once a year on with a physical underlying asset. >> Yeah. Yeah. Ex Well, yeah, but I mean Well, there's the what? There's no alternative unless you're thinking that they would rather do it in Bitcoin, but there's no way that they're going to want to do do it in Bitcoin. I mean, the Bitcoin can collapse at any moment. I mean, who the hell wants that kind of risk, you know? I mean, these they're trying to they're trying to do this with something that's more predictable and and and and uh less volatile. Uh they're not they're not going to take a chance on like on using Bitcoin. >> Well, I mean, gold and silver when you're talking about massive amounts of money that these guys are settling in, if it if it has a, you know, five or 10% drop or rise, like that's a big difference in uh actual at the end of the day, the bottom dollar. >> Yeah. Yeah, I mean look, there's, you know, daytoday, but you know, gold is pretty nonvolatile. I mean, every once in a while, you'll get a big swing like a couple of percent in one day. Uh, but it it's typically uh just been moving up uh in a in a slowly every day, you know, in a you know, it's not like runaway freight train. It just keeps going higher and higher and higher. And it's mainly because the dollar and other fiat currencies just keep steadily marching lower. Do you believe uh do do you trust these governments and and everything that they tell you as far as uh you know spec specifically to the amount of gold that they hold and the uh do like for has all the gold that we say it it does have. Well, you know, I think that some countries like China probably have more gold than they let on because I believe that the Chinese are start trying to accumulate a lot more gold and so they don't want the world to know exactly how much they have uh because they want to buy it cheaper and so I think they're playing their cards close to to the vest. Uh but it doesn't matter whether I trust them or not. I mean I'm not transacting with them. I mean they they need to trust each other. >> Well, how about Yeah, exactly. And how about America? Do you do you think that we have all the gold in Fort Knox? >> I don't know. I mean, you know, we may have loaned it out, you know, or leased it. Uh but, you know, our politicians lie about a lot of things, but the problem is, you know, how do you keep a lie like that hidden? I mean, it would require quite a few people to be quiet and it's usually hard to organize a grand conspiracy. >> Not that hard. I mean, if you look at the history of the United States, >> I mean, it's interesting that Donald Trump >> and, you know, Elon Musk and a few other people were talking about auditing Fort Knox uh early on and then you don't hear about that anymore. >> They didn't audit it and you don't hear about it. >> I know it's a it's a it's to me that's that's you know concerning and I I just am you know that this is I think I'm just curious on the audibility of of gold. I mean you it's that's that's the one thing I you know you say that Bitcoin has is magic internet money and has no utility but I think audibility is is uh is a big one you know to always know exactly what you have in real time. Um, >> yeah. I mean, and if you don't trust governments, I mean, private companies can tokenize gold, right, which is something that I'm talking about doing at T- Gold. Yeah. You know, my website's t-gold.com. But you can we can tokenize gold and we can have audits that are done by credible third parties that are real time audits visible where all the bars are accounted for. They're all numbered and you can see them all. And in fact, the tokens when you get a tokenized gold, you actually know what bar your token corresponds to in the vault, you know, because everything is is matched. Uh so I mean that's the interesting thing that with, you know, when when I did the the thing with with CZ and he, you know, he brings out this kilo bar gold from some, you know, unknown uh um you know, fabricating, you know, you know, company, whatever, whoever made it. So, I I can't recognize it, but it's like, \"Hey, is this real gold?\" Well, you maybe, but I mean, there maybe it's not 100%. I don't know, you know, what's in the middle of it. I can't I don't have X-ray eyes. I don't have um you know, there's there's equipment that you can easily assay a bar and know if it's, you know, got all the gold that is, you know, stamped on it. >> But that's not easy to do. >> When you have token when you have tokenized gold, it is every bit as verifiable as Bitcoin because it's the same principle. It's on a blockchain and the blockchain validates that if you have the tokenized gold that you have exactly what you're supposed to have, you know, trust you. >> Huh? >> Now we have to trust you instead of the government, right? And they >> Well, no, no, you don't have to trust you have to trust No, but you you have third party auditors, you know. I don't know what this, you know, all this stuff about trust, trust, trust. I mean, most people that are in Bitcoin have insurance. They have auto insurance. They have fire insurance. They have health insurance. All that is about trusting a third party. So if you're not willing to trust a third party, then you can't have insurance. >> It's all about third parties. >> We have to have it. I have to have auto insurance to drive my car, right? I have to have >> Well, you don't have to have collision. You just need liability. Do you have collision? >> Uh, no, I don't. Uh but a lot of people do because they're worried that if they if they cause an accident and they wreck their car, they can't afford uh to to fix it. So they they buy collision. But >> collision is only as good as the insurance company's ability to pay you. >> Yes. >> So you're relying on a third party to keep its promise to you and and honor your claim. um which we know >> gold worked very well as money for thousands of years and during a large part of that time gold was stored with third parties and we used paper backed by gold and it worked great and it wasn't a problem uh you know so Bitcoin is a a a a solution in in terms of a problem we we we don't have this huge credibility problem with not being able to trust third parties We can trust third parties. Now the problem that you have is if the government seizes uh your assets and you have it with a third party and a government comes in and seizes it from a third party. Yes, it's easier to seize your asset if they can take it from a third party. But apparently it's not that hard to seize Bitcoin either because that's where the US government got all its Bitcoin. That's where the Chinese government, that's where the German government or that all the governments that have Bitcoin, they got it because they took it from people. Yeah. >> So it wasn't impossible to confiscate. They did it >> right. Yes. I mean, but that's also true for currencies, for gold, everything. If you take down a drug, the government can take it all. >> The point I was making is that I think that a for me audibility is a big deal. Just to have the peace of mind knowing that uh within 10 minutes if someone sends me Bitcoin, I can verify it on chain. Uh and that's indisputable that you actually >> Well, you could do the same thing with with tokenized gold. You could verify that instantly. Yes, you can verify that you get the digital token from it, but you can't verify the fact that that's real gold sitting in a in a real >> Well, you have to Yes, you have to trust that the custodian before they tokenized it made sure that the gold that they were tokenizing was was legitimate. So, you have to trust. But again, so it all comes down to what you want to trust because with Bitcoin, you still have to trust something. It's just a different thing that you're trusting. So with gold, I'm just >> I'm with gold, I'm trusting that it's actually gold, right? But with Bitcoin, what you're trusting is that people will want it even though it's nothing. Even though Bitcoin isn't something valuable like gold, Bitcoin's value comes from the trust that people have in it, the confidence that the faith. And so what you're what you're gambling on is that there's going to be a robust community of people in the future who are going to want your Bitcoin because they also trust it, right? So you have to trust in that in the in the continued expansion of the pool of people because it's not that you you know if all the people that own Bitcoin today, right? If it if nobody else wants it, if it's just whatever today's community is is that's it. that's the end of it. And there's no new people coming in. It's just whoever owns it, then it's over because then the price can only go down because the people who own it have nobody to sell it to but but themselves. But if they've already if they already own it, uh then all they can do is sell and they don't have any buyers. So what you're trusting is that there's always going to be a larger pool of people who want Bitcoin so that the people who own Bitcoin now will always have somebody to sell it to later. But those people have to have the same leap of faith. They have to believe, yes, I'm buying now, right? I'm buying my Bitcoin. Let's say, you know, oh, we think Bitcoin is going to 200,000. Well, the person who buys Bitcoin at 200,000 has to believe that somebody else is going to pay 250,000 or 300,000 or they're not going to buy it. So, everybody has to believe there's more buyers coming later at a higher price. But it's possible that we've already seen the the highest price and there are no more no more buyers coming in. There's just buyers trying to get out try sellers, right, that are coming or maybe there's more there's some people coming in but there's not enough people coming in to accommodate the people getting out. And it may not even be numbers. It may be that the people getting out have a lot of Bitcoin. The big the big guys, the OGs, the whales, they're trying to unload. And even though more people are coming in, they're small buyers, right? So there's not enough of these small fish to get the whales out, you know, without the price dropping, which is why it's dropping. >> Yeah. I I do I mean, [clears throat] there's a lot of people both in gold and Bitcoin that are speculating on price and trading the asset, right? And I think that's, you know, that's true. But when you look at the like Bitcoin will continue to be volatile, as long as it's a small asset relative to gold or something like that. When Bitcoin gets to the same valuation as something like gold or even, you know, a quarter of the way there or half the way there, there'll be less volatility in it and more reason for people to do the kind of use cases. >> Well, you don't know that. I mean, that's just a a guess or hope. You're hoping that that would happen, >> right? But I I it's based on it's based on kind of logic and it's based on the logic of of auditability like I told you about and trust and I think it's a big deal as we discover more and more lies from the governments from everything that's happening. Trust in everybody and everything has gone significantly down. People, you know, there's all kinds of data that that shows you that trust in the governments, trust in in third parties has plummeted to absolute lows. Well, people could also lose trust in the Bitcoin uh industry and the Bitcoin providers. >> Why would they though? It's been it's it's some of the biggest liars out there. I mean, look at look at Michael Sailor. Look at the look at the stuff that he says. >> Well, look, he's not Bitcoin, though. He's just a sales. >> He's the biggest Bitcoin buyer there is, >> right? Yes. >> Not Bitcoin, though, right? He's just a >> But no, but he he he is he basically he's the reason that Bitcoin is as high as it is. he he's bought you he's spent almost $50 billion buying it. Um so I mean he is a huge factor and it's not just micro strategies buying of Bitcoin that has fueled it but because people know that he's going to keep buying Bitcoin. They feel comfortable in buying it because they know that Sailor's there like to keep he's the buyer that's like going to keep on buying it no matter what. And and so I if if people thought that Sailor was finished buying, you know, and that there was and and which, you know, at some point he's going to run out of firepower and he's probably very close to having to stop buying Bitcoin and then the key is going to be when does he have to start selling it because that's going to happen. And and I think when people start to realize that sellers got to sell, they're going to want to sell first, right? You're going to want to get rid of your Bitcoin before before >> speculate. Everything that you say is speculating the same way when I speculate the fact that that we're going to get adoption. You're speculating on logic. >> What the your logic is the fact that it has no underlying value, which I'm telling you that I believe that it does because you can audit it on point. You know it's real. Unlike you and I both agree, >> you can audit it. I I agree. Look, I agree that you can you can absolutely tell that you have a legitimate Bitcoin uh and you cannot counterfeit it. But the problem is what you have is legitimately nothing, right? You verified your ownership of nothing. So, you know, that that's the the key flaw there. At least with gold, when I verify, I'm verifying that I actually own gold. When you verify Bitcoin, all you get is a verification that you don't own anything because Bitcoin itself is nothing. That's what you have to wrap your arms around. It is nothing. >> It's a super scarce asset. It's same like >> No, it is not. It is not an asset. It doesn't have any qualifications of an asset. It does. It you know, it's a token. I'll give you that. Uh but I think it's a fake asset because it you know, it doesn't have any real use. It doesn't generate any income. It we've we've we've decided it's a meme, right? You know, does Trump >> Well, does Trump coin have any value or Melaniacoin or Fartcoin? >> They don't, right? >> Why not? What's the difference? >> Well, they I I guess they could if everyone believed that it was going to serve the same purpose as >> Okay, so the difference is belief. If you believe in it, then that makes it so. >> It's the same thing with everything else. The price of of of gold is determined. >> No, it's not. Gold has value whether you believe it has value or not. I mean it objectively is a valuable metal. I mean look at all the look at all the industries that need gold have to buy it. >> But but that that but that value of gold is significantly lower than it is right now. Right. That that >> No, you mean no it's not >> the use case for it. Yeah. For you but you're you're arguing that it comes to jewelry and you know manufacturing and things like that. If it was actually valued at the utility for which you're claiming it has utility, what do you think the price would be? >> No, it's mainly been valued for that. Uh because we haven't even used it as money. Central banks have been using it and so there's been a value there from central banks and that's just starting to to come into it. But remember the all of the gold that we store what we're doing is storing the the future use of the gold because gold can always be used in manufacturing. It can always be used. And the reason that gold is not used even more often is because it's too expensive. And so, you know, maybe we we use copper for wires instead of gold. Gold would work better, but not for the money. Copper copper does the job good enough and it's a lot cheaper. But you know uh the thing about gold is the gold that I have today in a thousand years in a 100,000 years it's exactly the same. It could still be used and reused. So it's it's not going away. So the the today the price of gold represents the the present value of the future uses of gold. So you're not just saying what's gold worth today. It's what it's going to be worth from now until the end of time. Because most assets aren't like that or most commodities, they have a shelf life. They go bad. If you don't use it by a certain date, you got to throw it away. And a lot of other assets, right, you buy them, they depreciate and then you write them off because, you know, they're obsolete. But, you know, the gold that we're using today is the same gold that they used 5,000 years ago, right? I mean, it, you know, it's here. It doesn't it's not less valuable than it was back then unlike everything else that they might have used is you know gone to dust. Okay. Um, so you so your solution here is to make gold. First of all, I I what you said it feels like it contradicts itself a little bit because if gold becomes too expensive uh to actually be used in manufacturing for example or jewelry or whatever and so they switch to alternatives uh then then the price of gold to be used down again. it it it will never be too expensive to be used uh because in the areas where gold is vital uh they're going to use it uh even at the higher price. It's just in certain areas where it does you don't need gold. gold will gold will do the job the best, but it's not the only metal that will work. Then you can substitute other metals. But there are certain circumstances where gold is the only thing that will work. And then you've got to buy the gold regardless of the price. Gold's $10,000 an ounce. You're going to buy it because you need it because you can't use copper because copper won't work. Um, and so there are a lot of things for gold uh that, you know, just require people to buy it at whatever the price is and that's going to happen. A lot of it is not gold prices going up. You have to separate the fact that it's really the value of the dollar and other currencies that are going down. >> Right. But I Yeah, we definitely agree on that. Uh [clears throat] I but I'm just like genuinely curious because I don't I don't know uh what what are the utilities for gold that that cannot be substitute with some other sort of asset or >> I mean gold is unique in in the way it reacts to other chemicals uh and uh and and the way it conducts electricity and its malleability uh and the the things that other metals you can't do you could do it with gold like they had they had this u Hubble space um uh telescope that they launched into space. And in order for it to work, they had to coat the mirrors with gold >> because any other metal wouldn't have worked that the mirrors would have either burned up or whatever. It would the only way they can get the the mirrors to actually survive space and that I think or was it just even getting into orbit or being out in space? The only thing they could do is coat them in gold. And even though it was expensive, the whole thing wouldn't have worked unless they did it. Um, but you know, there there and and gold gets used in a lot of things that go inside the human body because it it doesn't it doesn't interact. It's very neutral. Other other metals will will have a reaction >> like what? >> Uh so so it has it has properties that are unique to gold that give it a lot of of value apart from the fact that it's just a beautiful uh metal. I mean, that's why it's so popular in jewelry. I mean, not just because it's beautiful, but because of how you work with it and, you know, and you know, you have a nice gold uh jewelry. You know, a lot of people like jewelry to be an heirloom. They like to have jewelry passed down uh from their father and their grandfather and their great-grandfather. And you could do that with gold jewelry, right? And >> on that one, for sure. I mean, I I have a bunch. I even have a I even have a jeweler that makes all my gold stuff. That's That's why I'm I'm actually curious like this is all gold. Everything I've got on me is gold. Like uh and I >> Yeah. And as you know, you can go, you know, you can go in the water with it. It's not going to get rusty. It's not, you know, it's not going to tarnish, you know? >> Right. So, but okay. Um >> and meanwhile, just we're just getting a big boom here. I'm watching, you know, now gold's up $45, getting back to close to $4,300 again, and silver is up almost another $2. We're almost at $64 now for the I mean, I've been telling people I thought silver was going to get to $100 an ounce uh by next year. And you know, we're going to be pretty damn close. I doubt we're going to get I mean, we're going to be pretty damn close this year in 2020 uh in 2025. I mean, so it's not even going to be that big a call, but yeah, I mean, I think $100 silver uh is very very realistic for next year. Is silver just the beta play to gold or does it have a lot of the same properties and things like that you just described for for gold? I mean, why why is it chasing gold so much? >> Well, silver and gold historically are correlated. They're both monetary metals. Silver uh is has a lot more industrial use because of the lower price, right? I mean, if silver was the same price of gold, then obviously people would try to use something else. Uh but silver has been cheap enough that it has been used more widely in in industry. Um so a lot of its demand comes from industry more so than than gold where more of the demand is savers, investors, central banks. Uh and what was going on was that central banks were doing the buying and when central banks were doing the buying, silver was kind of, you know, just kind of left aside because silver is more uh for private investors, not central banks. They they focus on gold. Private investors buy both, but private investors were not in the market. They were just complacent. They were in tech stocks. They were buying Bitcoin. They weren't buying gold or silver. But now that uh private money is finally starting to come into the market, some of it is going into silver and there's just not a lot of silver there. Silver has been a very short supply. It didn't really take that much and there were a lot of shorts in silver. Uh and I think now they're being taken out uh you know and and beaten up pretty bad. Uh so I think the shorts are in a lot of trouble. Um but silver's been cheap. I mean, I've been, you know, pounding the table on, you know, my podcast, you know, for shift gold because silver was down to 100 to one. You were able to buy, this is at the end of last year, early this year, you could buy uh 100 ounces of silver with a single ounce of gold. I mean, that had never happened. That was the cheapest silver had ever been. >> And, you know, and so it was a it was a good buy. Silver is just catching up. I think this I think it's we're headed to 50 to1 and and so maybe we get there maybe when silver is $100 an ounce, gold is $5,000 an ounce or you know and that's about that's about it. Um do you Peter, do you uh do you ever wonder or worry as technology increases that we we will find a lot more gold and silver in the earth or somewhere else that uh >> that I don't think technology has already increased a lot and we haven't had any any major gold discoveries in a decade or two. >> Um >> there's been pretty big ones like in Africa and China. >> Yeah. No, most of the most of what you hear about big gold discoveries is is you know being uh uh you know just dis um um distributed by uh by Bitcoiners. Like especially I get a kick out of the asteroids, right? the gold asteroid that's coming where it's going to make gold worthless. Um, but no, I mean, there hasn't been a lot of money even spent looking for gold because the gold price hasn't even been high enough to justify it because it was so expensive to mine it. Now, finally, the gold mining companies are making a lot of money. Now, gold at 4,000 and change. Now, they're going to start looking for gold. But even if they find it, it's going to take years and years and years to get it out of the ground. Even assuming they find it, it take years to find it. It's not easy. >> Yeah. But the second that the markets are always forward looking, the second that they find a huge deposit, if they do uh like a real significant one, then everyone understands at the moment. >> Well, you don't know until you actually dig it up. They can do tests and they can try to estimate what might be down there, but you don't really know for sure until you actually, you know, get in there. >> You can't audit it also. But yeah, there's not going to be look when people are trying to figure out, you know, crazy ways that the value of gold can be disrupted. You know, it's much more likely that something happens. You know, quantum computing hacks Bitcoin, there's, you know, a solar flare that wipes out, you know, there there there are more things that are likely to happen even if there's a slim chance of it. But I think you have more vulnerability to Bitcoin and way that your Bitcoin can be wiped out than gold being uh you know becoming worthless because of you know some event like you know a golden meteor just shows up out of nowhere. >> Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I guess we we we don't really know, right? Uh so I'm curious though. Uh what do you what are your targets for in 2026 for both Bitcoin and silver? Sorry, gold and silver. Well, you know, I've been saying I think gold's going to at least hit 5,000 by next year, which isn't even that, you know, crazy when it's at 4,200 and change right now, but at least 5,000, maybe six next year. And I've been saying $100 silver. And, you know, we're getting closer and closer to 100 even before we get into 2026. But, you know, it's always possible that the prices could be a lot higher if we have a real dollar crisis. I mean, I know a dollar crisis is coming. >> Yeah. I just don't know when because I've expected one for a long time now and you know we haven't had it. We we've been able to kick the can down the road. But when we have a real dollar crisis, uh then we're going to see much much higher gold and silver prices. >> Yeah. All right, Peter. Uh thanks for coming on today. Really appreciate it. For the folks watching, uh where can they learn more about you, follow you? >> You can follow me, follow my podcast. I'm gonna, you know, at shiftradio.com or on my YouTube channel. Subscribe to the YouTube channel. uh you know follow me on X that's my biggest platform for uh you know communicating with people uh you know I compose all my own posts there so you get to hear my thoughts real time and I do have a newsletter a free newsletter that you can subscribe to at shifts sovereign.com so it's just my last name shifts sovereign.com and just input your information you'll start getting the newsletters in your inbox a lot of good valuable information uh that we're putting out on a regular basis from shift >> sovereign well there you But folks, uh Peter and I definitely agree on on one thing is to diversify and uh and but we are quite the opposite in which we we think the runner will will be the most where uh you know I have some some uh amount of my portfolio in precious metals, gold, silver uh things like that and uh but majority >> set up a small account you know you just set up an account of T- Gold. You know you can put in 50 100 bucks that don't even matter. Just get going. I prefer physical I prefer self custody. Uh but >> yeah. Well then we we do that too at shift gold. We just we ship it right to you. >> I think it's important. I think I think it's important to to have you know physical gold. I don't I don't think it's going to you know I agree with with you Peter on a lot of things. I don't think that it you know I think that gold is a solid >> uh it always has been a solid investment but um you know for me uh I believe in this kind of a you know changing and and potentially what happens. And so I want to be there for the upside as if it happens. But I do believe in diversifying. So uh so yeah, thanks Peter for coming on. Really appreciate it. And >> all right, take care. >> Catch you on the next one. >> All right. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
