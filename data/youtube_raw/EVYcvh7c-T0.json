  "transcript": "I'm also working to ensure America remains the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin, all of them. Congress is working very hard on crypto market structure legislation. >> Cryptocurrency is taking over the world economic form in Davos this week. As just in, President Donald Trump says our stock market is going to double in a relatively short amount of time. He says he's running this economy for growth. He's running this economy hot and crypto will be next. You know, stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So, Iceland's already cost us a lot of money, but that dip is peanuts compared to what it's gone up. And we have an unbelievable future in that stock. That stock market is going to be doubled. We're going to hit 50,000 and that stock market's going to double in a relatively short period of time. >> So, what will be the new narratives and the new reason why crypto continues to do well in 2026 and beyond? Well, CZ Binance just laid it out. He says, \"In Bitcoin and crypto's first 15 years, it was exchanges and stable coins that did well. In Bitcoin and crypto's next 15 years, tokenization, payments, and particularly AI. AI will use crypto more than people.\" Listen, >> but right now in the crypto space, there's really two proven uh industries, the exchanges and stable coins. Those are large businesses. I'm really excited about three new more. Uh I think uh tokenization is a huge one. I'm talking with probably a dozen governments about tokenizing some of their assets because this way the government can actually realize the financial pro uh financial gains first and use that to develop those industries extractions um you know uh the the trading markets etc. U payments is something that we've tried have not really conquered in uh well have not really started in crypto. We tried but it doesn't nobody really pays in crypto. But I think now we're seeing the convergence of traditional payment methods being on behind the scenes being supported by crypto. So the the spenders swipe a card crypto gets deducted from their account. The merchants gets US dollars or euros or how whatever they get. So now when we have those bridges I think payments is going to become pretty big. The third one is what you guys all mentioned is AI. Uh the native currency for AI agent is going to be crypto.

So, smash the like button, subscribe to Altcoin Daily. Cryptocurrency is taking over the world economic form like never before. I was surprised to hear the Bitcoin World Economic Forum like this. And you know, he's agreeing with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond. He's agreeing with Black Rockck CEO Larry Frink. The host asks him, \"Hey, don't you think Bitcoin's best days are behind it?\" He goes, \"No, I think Bitcoin and crypto's best days are ahead of it.\" Saying, \"I think all the cryptocurrencies are going to continue to see strength. I think there's a lot of excitement, not just from early crypto players, but from traditional finance.\" And that perhaps is the most surprising. >> I think all the cryptocurrencies are going to continue to see strength. I'm sure you saw the comments from Jamie Diamond about how, you know, this is a better technology. Um, you know, to kind of run everything's on the token or or crypto layer. Um, that's great. The more it becomes mainstreamed though, the less impressive Bitcoin's performance does. I'm just curious if you have any comments about that. >> I think there's many use cases on top of the digital technology that we have. So, Bitcoin deserves full credit for having pioneered this space as the first token that we had. Um, initially it was designed, you know, to be potentially a payment system. on the payments side, you know, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction there, but it's certainly very clearly a great store of value. I think all the cryptocurrencies are going to continue to see strength uh over the long long arc of time. But then on top of that, we now have new use cases, right? So stable coins you're very familiar with may turn out to be an easier payment system for most people because it's one to one tied to the price of the dollar. Um on top of that, we've got DeFi, we've got tokenized equities, you know, and rather than take it from me, I mean, you can ask uh Larry Frink from Black Rockck. He says every asset, every to every stock, every bond can be tokenized. So I think there's a lot of excitement, not just from the, you know, early players, the technology side, but also from traditional finance, which is really why it makes it so exciting to to be here New York Stock Exchange today. >> Two trillion BNY Melon CEO is echoing this sentiment. It seems so many of the largest players in traditional finance are coming out and saying, \"Hey, we're excited about AI. We're excited about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and crypto. >> We're excited. We're excited about AI. We're excited about digital assets. We're excited about innovation. We're excited about our people. And all of that is for serving our customers. And so you can feel that in the halls of the company today. And that's that's a fun thing. Smash the like button if you're getting value on Altcoin Daily. We always try to keep things real with you. This is why you subscribe. I'll be honest with you guys, in the short term, it is a bit concerning that Bitcoin and crypto aren't seeing the same strength that the stock market and precious metals are seeing. Taking a look at Bitcoin on the daily, we are back testing ascending resistance from the 50-day moving average. This is not ideal. You can see there's some resistance here. Like I said before, guys, we have to get out of January and early February. We have another government shutdown looming. We have a Fed shakeup. Who knows what Jerome Pal is going to do? We have the Supreme Court tariff decision. In the short term, just looking at historically, again, we always try to keep things real with you. If a black swan type event happens, a 55k Bitcoin is possible. Again, I think Bitcoin could touch 55K in a black swan type environment. I think more likely in the short term, what Bitcoin would do is not make a huge leg down to to 55K all the way down here. I think more likely last cycles resistance now turned into support. We briefly touched 75K back here in April. I think in the short term we could see and this would scare people going below 75K to low7s maybe even touching 69420 and then a V-shaped recovery. So low70s are possible in the short term. It could even be likely but you should be a buyer at these levels. What did Warren Buffett say? Be greedy when others are fearful. Smash the like button on this video if you agree with that because for me there's no clearer signal than the realized capital flow. The realized capital flow. Look where it is. It shows whether there's net capital flowing into or out of the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past month. And right now we're deep in extreme red, meaning there's net outflows. this is exactly where I'd want to be buying because it's not just President Trump saying, \"I'm going to run the economy hot.\" Other analysts like Arc Invests CEO and CIO Kathy Wood, she just shared her 2026 predictions for crypto, but all financial markets for the US economy and all markets and why she thinks the US economy is a coiled spring. What do you think about her analysis here? >> You call the US economy a coiled spring for many reasons. I'm wondering how you think that translates into what the markets may do this year. >> Yes. Uh well, we think that uh we've been through a rolling recession. We've seen it in housing, manufacturing, small business, consumer sentiment, and that thanks to tax cuts, big refunds this first quarter, but corporate tax cuts as well. So, big investment cycle ahead. uh as well as deregulation which I think is highly underestimated in terms of its impact uh and lower interest rates and lower inflation sounds like Goldilocks. Uh that that is all going to play out this year and be very good for the financial markets. >> So that being said, it is no surprise that Kathy Wood also came out to say Bitcoin's bottom is in and this will be one of the shallowest four-year cycle declines in Bitcoin's short history. I know there's a lot of fear about the four-year cycle. We didn't have much of an up cycle by Bitcoin standards. So, we think we're pretty well through the down cycle here. We may test in this 80 to 90,000 range on Bitcoin. Uh but we do think that the test will be successful. It will be the shallowest uh four-year cycle decline in Bitcoin short history. Uh and then we're off again. Uh we think this is three revolutions in one. A global monetary system rules-based competing against fiat currency to be sure. It is a a technology revolution and it is the leader of a new asset class. >> Also, I would be buying Ethereum here. Look at this. Ethereum is the bedrock of tokenization. There's no getting around the strength, the growth of the momentum of this ecosystem. More from Arc Invest. Arc just put out their big ideas 2026 in Bitcoin, crypto, tokenization. Ethereum is winning the onchain asset war. Ethereum hosts 400 billion plus in onchain assets. Ethereum remains the preferred blockchain for onchain assets. Stable coins, tokens, DeFi, memecoins, RWAs, most of this is taking place on Ethereum. Also, Ethereum layer 2s. Salana, BNB chain, and Tron make up 2, three, and four. Arc Invest is predicting in general that digital assets i.e. crypto could reach a 28 trillion market cap value by 2030. Right now, Bitcoin's market cap is less than 2 trillion. The greater crypto market cap is way less than 2 trillion. Traditional finance understands something which was hard for them to grasp in Bitcoin's first 15 years. Bitcoin is now battle tested. It has a Lindy effect. Bitcoin is maturing as the leaders of a new institutional asset class. And here Arc Invest talks about everything Bitcoin made it through in 2025. The good and the bad. Speaking about Ethereum, should you buy Ethereum here? I do personally think now is a great time to buy. The last two times Ethereum dropped below its TVL, it was an amazing buying opportunity. This is Ethereum fully diluted market cap versus ecosystem total value locked. We are here. As the Ethereum network grows, the floor price will rise. Once stable coin adoption really explodes, there might not be much time to buy cheap ETH anymore. Eyes on the Clarity Act and stable coin growth will explode. We know this. the next generation of blockchain networks. They're designed specifically for the financial and economic activity of a world where three years, five years from now, uh, one, I think, can reasonably expect that there will be billions, literally billions of AI agents conducting economic activity in the world continuously on a continuous basis. They need an economic system. They need a financial system. They need a payment system. There is no other alternative in my view other than stable coins to do that right now. and that can keep up with that pace of technological change. >> And we did get our hands on the Bitine Ethereum 2026 market outlook. Obviously, we understand Bitine is bullish. But how bullish are they? Well, their conservative case for Ethereum is actually where Ethereum is now, maybe a little bit higher. Their base case, this is what they think is likely to happen, 6,000 to 9,000. And then their bullcase for Ethereum in 2026 and beyond is 20,000 plus. This is if everything goes right. In other news, former Almeida Research CEO Caroline Ellison has been released after serving 440 days in federal custody. As you know, she worked with prosecutors to take down the rest. Bitcoin up 18% since she first reported to prison. And founder SPF still has 19 more years to go. So much is happening in crypto. It's hard not to be bullish. So many people just don't understand everything that's coming up, the tailwinds to take crypto to its next level. But that's what we show you every day here on Altcoin Daily.
