  "transcript": "Banter Fam, happy Monday to you all. New start \nof the week, new weekly candle closes, giving us   a little bit of insight. If I look at the last \nweekly close, it did show that this week would   start off red, but it is showing us we should \nstart off quite aggressively to the green side   at the end of the week. There are a couple of \nbig things that I want to show you guys today.   Momentum is starting to change, specifically \nmidterm on a lot of altcoins. I want to show   you guys the key tools to see which altcoins \nare stronger than the rest right now. I want   to paint this picture for you that we are starting \nto shift the tides. The bear is starting to slowly   run out and we are starting to get really strong \nindicators to show that over the next couple of   weeks we are going to see some upside within the \nmarkets. We can then take that information and   strategize where we are putting our money. What \namount of money are we going to be trading where?   What are we leaving for the midterm? What are we \nleaving for the long term? What bots are we using?   It is so important for you to have structure \nand understanding of what is strong and where   we are right now. I think the big question has \nbeen, are the tides turning? I am here to show   you guys today that I am seeing on specifically \n10 to 20 good altcoins that we are starting to   get bullish momentum back into the market. So \nguys, happy Monday to you all. Missed you all.   Last show was on Saturday. New week, new start. \nLet's get a game plan. Let's go. I try and help   everyone in my space and this is what I get. I try \nand fight the devils, but inside I am just like,   yes, squad, how are we all doing? Hope you have \nhad a great weekend and are nice and recharged.   Now let's start going through a plan for the week. \nFirst, I want to start by making sure that you are   seeing opportunities when they are coming. It \nis very important when things are starting to   turn. Even though we are still seeing a little \nbit of chop within the markets, we saw some   strength come in and I think the question is, was \nthat strength enough to break structure? If so,   when you see redness like we are seeing at \nthe start of this week, this is activation   redness. This is confidence. I am building on \nthis current pullback. Was the pump enough on   whatever altcoin you are paying attention to? Was \nit enough to break structure? If it was enough to   break structure, it is very important to have \nthe confidence to enter the trades. It is very   important to get on the horse and look at the \nbest strategy you can use. You have learned   from the past. There have been times this market \nhas taken money and given money in the last year.   You need to activate on this pullback. You cannot \nallow past fear to slow you down. Today is a   starting point of you getting back on the horse \nand having confidence behind your trades. For me,   I will always have bad and good streaks. But \none thing that will never die with me is I   know that my wins are bigger than my losses. \nThe confidence is what really drives me to   get back my money or to get way ahead. It is not \nabout being perfect or winning more than losing,   but confidence is a big thing. I want you to \ngo recap your career in crypto. Look at where   you went right, where you went wrong, and what \nworked really well for you in the past. I want   you to play your strengths. May this be only spot \ntrading, leverage trading, investing, or bots. The   key this year is to play your strengths. When \nit comes to experimentals, play them with one   or two percent of the capital. When you can sit \non a red day and enter trades with confidence,   that is when you know you are comfortable with \nthat strategy. The big mistake many traders make   is going too big into a new narrative too quickly. \nThere is a cycle to everything. If I learn   something on two percent and then activate thirty \npercent of my account four months later, you are   setting up good fundamentals. If you are desperate \nto make money back, play your strengths. Are you   really good at leverage right now or are you \nreally good at spot trades? What is your number   one A-game? Make sure seventy percent of your \ntime right now is playing A and B because it is   conservative time. It is time to not lose anymore. \nKeep growing, but grow with ten to twenty percent.   As this market starts to break structures and move \nup again, those plan B, C, and D strategies will   be used. Let's jump into what is happening right \nnow. Can I get some likes? I am going to give away   five Bitfunded accounts today. Get the likes up. I \nwill choose them in the stream. Get yourself into   a routine on a Monday. I want to look at things \non a high time frame. Look at where we closed on   Bitcoin price. We closed with a red candle. The \nreason why there is a start of redness right now   is this wick. We had some strength but ultimately \nclosed red and left a wick, which means liquidity   is sitting lower down. That is why the market \nwants to come down and capture liquidity. Have   we broken structure to say that it is a big \nweek of redness ahead? If I look at that, we   have not broken structure. We are actually coming \ninto support. In a bullish scenario, the market   will come down, pull this liquidity, and we will \nsee growth to the upside. An accelerated amount   of growth happens when we break that trend to the \nupside. Right now, the market is starting to slow   down its range. Bitcoin altcoins range is a little \nbit bigger. I am always confident in support   buys. I am not confident in resistance buys. When \nBitcoin was at 94,000 or 93,000, I was not buying   because that is straight into resistance. I am \nconfident when we hit support. Redness is actually   very good and greenness is actually very bad \nfor entries. The moment we start to switch those   two things around, you start to find success. We \nhave been taught to chase things that are green,   but then we are always late to the party. The \npeople who made all the money were fishing in   the red previously. You do not want to arrive \nwhen the club is about to close. The best time   is to get there early and be part of the party \nas it is rallying. The only way you get in early   is to fish when not many are fishing. As it stands \nnow, have we broken any structure to the downside?   No. My bottom trend line validates that. RSI has \nbeen sitting at the bottom and we are about to   exit. Every time we have exited, we have sped up. \nBitcoin has been oversold on the weekly since the   first week of September 2025. We are sitting at \nfour or five months of the market being oversold.   The bulls do come back into play and buying power \ndoes return. The bears are arrogant. They are   certain Bitcoin is going down to 50,000 dollars. \nWe all know what happens to arrogance in this   space. Tides turn and tides wipe people out. Where \nis max pain right now? What will catch the market   most off guard? Most people think 70,000 dollars \nis more believable than 150,000 dollars. Do not be   surprised if the market goes for max pain, which \nis always going against the tides. When Bitcoin   was above 100K, people really believed in a 200K \nplay. That is when the off-guard move catches   everyone. What is up, Fefe? Good to see you, \nbro. Altcoins had a little bit of a red candle   as well. But look at the wick from last week on \nthe downside. It is much smaller than the Bitcoin   wick. Altcoins are getting a little bit stronger. \nThey are holding downside better than they   previously did. The pullbacks are starting to get \nsmaller because there is no one left to shake out.   We broke some key structures and trends. We are \non hot zones with a higher high in play on the   weekly. Charts are saying altcoins are gaining \nmomentum. When they get bullish, they get really   bullish. The key is to buy them now rather than \nsix months from now when they are aggressive.   Bitcoin dominance is telling the same story. Look \nat this candle. It closed red and has a big wick   to the downside. High time frame shows we lost \nthat big trend. It is very likely this is going   to start dropping aggressively. This aligns with \nTotal 3, which is showing a retest and a push to   the upside. Waves to the upside start off slow and \nthen increase. The next wave is the hope phase,   and that is the bigger leg up. You can use moving \naverages to look at sentiment and momentum. Put in   a 20 MA and a 50 MA on the daily time frame. These \nmoving averages show when momentum is shifting.   You are looking for a cross. When we crossed to \nthe upside previously, we rallied from 60,000 to   100,000 dollars. When we crossed to the downside, \nwe went from 97,000 down to 80,000. Right now,   the lines are just starting to cross and holding \nsupport areas. This is not just slightly bullish;   it is a significant shift. Bitcoin is starting to \nshow strength. Now let's look at the altcoins. SUI   pumped and made a way higher high. We see \nthe cross on SUI. This is what you should be   paying attention to buy on this pullback. SUI \nis the signal. Cardano has not crossed yet. It   is still in a downtrend and is one of the weaker \ncoins right now. It does not mean it won't pump,   but it is not the shiniest object yet. I am more \ninterested in building SUI bots today. Is there   a cross on ETH? Yes, there is. We are in support \nto buy right now. This is where I need to build my   ETH positions. Solana is very close to the cross. \nIt is looking stronger than a lot of altcoins.   Solana will really pump when it breaks the high \nit has not touched since October. 130 to 140 is a   good area to accumulate for the long term. AVAX is \non the verge of a cross and coming into support.   Chainlink is coming into the test but has not \ncrossed fully yet. It is a good area for the long   term, but maybe not the trading token for today. \nFetch is seeing a golden cross and coming down to   test. Render has been strong and is a great area \nto build on this pullback. Algo has broken out and   is on the verge of a cross. Doge is not mega \nbullish yet but is a good place to accumulate   before the market wakes up. Zcash is losing \nmomentum to the downside, so it is not the most   exciting short-term play. Bitcoin is starting to \nshow a cross. Large caps like SOL are starting to   break structures. We are not in a full alt season \nyet because smaller coins pump only after money   has already come into the big caps. Bitcoin, ETH, \nand SOL will bring the most liquidity into crypto   first. I am paying attention to blue chips. LIDO \nis showing strength and coming to retest. Gaming   like Illuvium is not strong right now. The 20 MA \ntracks the last 20 days and the 50 MA is a higher   time frame tool. When we start losing the 50 MA, \nthat is when we see big changes. The 50 MA is a   powerful tool to tell you when to exit. Right \nnow, it is the lowest risk in the market to   enter in the last two years. If you look after \nthe downside, the upside will come naturally.   Those with the cojones to get in when things \nare shifting are the ones who get rich. I am   allocating to bots on Pionex right now. \nThese are low leverage with stop losses.   On my Bitfunded accounts, I am at 99,300. I am \nwaiting for the next opportunity. On the short   time frame for Bitcoin, I do not see us dropping \nmuch lower than 89,800 before pushing to 94,000.   The market might be crappy for the next 24 to \n48 hours, but look for upside around Wednesday.   I am looking at a short-term relief rally for \nZcash. It is a 13 percent trade. Bitfunded has   raised the maximum loss and daily loss limits. \nThe buy one get one free promotion is running   out today. It is one of the safest ways to trade \nleverage. ETH dominance looks strong. SUI against   Bitcoin is also showing outperformance. Beam \nis a good long-term accumulate but might need   a few weeks for real momentum. Do not miss \nthe hope pumps. David, Shane, Devie Diva,   and Roberto, you all get Bitfunded accounts. \nI am fighting with Cryptomanran in a good way   to get crypto live trading started. Have a \nfantastic day. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.",
