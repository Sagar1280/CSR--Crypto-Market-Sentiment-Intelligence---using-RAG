  "transcript": "They just postponed the Clarity Act, the exact catalyst everyone said was powering this rally. So, if Bitcoin pumped on the headlines, this should have dumped hard. But it didn't. And that is the tell, my friends. Today's episode, it's simple. Was this move real demand or just narrative and leverage? Yes, that was a question we asked yesterday, but today, new details have emerged. You'll want to hear that because the market just gave us a live stress test. We talked about that yesterday and the results, they do matter. Welcome back, my friends. Quick 15 or so minutes, high signal only show. If you appreciate that, do me a favor, destroy that like button. If you're new to the channel, what's up? My name is Kyle. Subscribe to the channel if you're not already. Let's get into it. Today, we're going to cover why the Clarity Act got postponed. the real reasons, not the cope. What the money is doing right now, ETFs, leverage, positioning, and the two levels that decide if this is a breakout or fake out from here. We're also going to cover some macro things that are very, very important. Great show today. And again, remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. First, we're going to talk about why the Clarity Act was postponed and why. First, official confirmation. The Senate Banking's executive session to consider HR 3633 is marked postponed. Let that sink in for a second, guys. This was supposed to be the clean bullish catalyst. Instead, it hit a speed bump publicly. Now, here is the why. Coinbase actually hit the brakes. Armstrong called the current bill materially worse than the status quo. meaning if this thing passed the way it was, we would have been worse off than we were with no clarity whatsoever. And he pointed out several landmines. One, tokenized equities were getting effectively boxed out, which is important to what we're doing at Wealth. DeFi restrictions were expanding. Not good for us again in everything I'm doing at Block and Wealth. Stable coin rewards getting targeted. Banks didn't like that. We'll talk about that later. And even the fear that it reduces CFTC's role versus what industry wants, which is CFTC to control us, not the SEC. And that translates to this wasn't a crypto wins regulatory moment. It was a the draft text is a problem moment. And it really was. And it was different than what we have been promised publicly. Very different. I'm glad that didn't slip through. And now let's talk about that bigger fight that no one really wants to talk about, but that's the banks versus the stable coin yield. And here's the deeper reason why it keeps getting very, very messy. There's an active turf war right now between banks and crypto over tokens that pay rewards that look a whole lot like interest. And banks do not want that normalized. The Wall Street Journal frames it as a major clash that's delaying progress. So even if you love regulatory clarity as a narrative, the sausage making guys, it's not bullish, clean or fast. And this is why these bills don't just pass, they get negotiated into something nobody recognizes really. Also important, while banking got postponed, the Agriculture Committee, which is a CFTC jurisdiction, laid out a fresh timeline. Well, that means the text will be released on January 21st, close of business day, and the markup on January 27th at 3 p.m. So, it's definitely not dead. It is delayed and it will be negotiated. And that means the regulatory catalyst is now less of a this week kind of trade and more of a this month or quarter kind of trade. And if it takes longer, it takes longer. We'd love to see clarity, but we want to see clarity done right. This is so important that this bill gets it right. This is setting the standard of how we as an industry may or may not move forward in America. And often times other countries look to America for guidance. So this could be setting the tone for a lot of other countries as well. And that one framing shift changes how you should trade it, how you should be looking ahead, and how you should potentially size it. Now, here's why today matters. Bitcoin held up around the mid 96ks even after this hit the tape. And we recently saw that it got up to $97.7,000. Now, that's not what a purely narrative pump looks like. If the rally was fake, you'd see a quick rejection, loss of prior support, and an unwind in a hurry. But if you're watching the charts today, you can see every dip is getting eaten up. So, we are seeing resilience. So, you can see we talked about yesterday. If you look at this long-term tread line over here all the way back from November 2024, Bitcoin had bounced off the 50week EMA, the exponential moving average. It came be it came below it, which is what people freaked out about saying that we were definitely going into a bare market. Right? This is from the October 10th catastrophe that happened, the capitulation. What we're about to see here pretty soon probably is likely the telltale if this can get back above this 97.5. In the yesterday's show, we talked exactly this this marker right here 97.5K. We said it probably reject on that point. As long as it stays above this blue line that we drew here. Yes, I know my technical analysis is extremely awesome considering that I am a big technical analyst guy. Just joking. You guys know that this blue line here that has been resistance ever since at about $945,000 every time it boom tries to break through it, bounces off, tries to break through it, bounces off, tries, bounces off, finally broke through it. So for me, as long as we can stay above this 945, we're probably likely to change and the reverse the trend. Also guys, every time you see one of these red sales on my buy bit chart, guys, that is me stacking SATs. Again, I use Sequence. There's a link down below. It is an affiliate link. I do make some money when you guys trade off of your Bitcoin, but it's only if you make if you're only able to stack stats, right? Every single one of these, again, I have to say this, the the previous history of success does not equal future guarantee of success. But with that being said, what I've achieved so far has been a 0% loss rate. And guys, let me know in the comments below if you let me make a video just on sequence. I tell you this because it's an amazing product. I'm using it myself. I started testing at March 10th of 2025. And what I'm likely to do is I'm actually I had one Bitcoin in there to start with. I now have 1.1467 in 10 months. Almost 15% gain in my Bitcoin. Phenomenal. Where else can you do that? So, I'm going to add more Bitcoin probably again coming up here pretty soon. I'm going to start probably tripling or quadrupling what I've got in there right now. So, anyway, just wanted to share that with you because it's awesome. But also, uh just remember this this line right here has been major major support. Can we flip it into resistance? let me know. And the the next key major resistance is 97.5. Maybe we break that through. Maybe we break through that today. Maybe we don't. But nonetheless, I'm excited to see what happens. Guys, let me know in the comments below what you think will happen. So again, the reason that we're seeing this resilience, well, it's because the market just told you something. Even when the headline catalyst gets delayed, there's still a big bid under this thing because spot demand showed up in size. And we talked about this yesterday, guys. What did we say? We said if we saw continue to see big demand from ETFs, boom. Well, that's what we wanted to see and we got that yesterday with an even bigger day than we talked about yesterday. Yesterday we talked about this 753.8 million inflow which was the largest we had seen since the beginning what was it like I forget but we said yesterday but in many many months since early October I believe and we got an even a bigger day yesterday. Let's see what happens today. But again uh the markets are still looking good. The chart's still looking good. When the NASDAQ opened earlier today, we saw a $1,500 wick candle down, but that's been eaten up ever since. We're still sitting right here at 96.713. So, yeah, guys, that's a roughly $1.6 billion inflow in just 2 days. And the composition of how that's made up is important. On day one, Fidelity led that charge. The next day, Black Rockck absolutely dominated. That looks like institutions are reallocating, not just retail chasing candles. This is the difference between price went up because Twitter said so versus price went up because real money actually had to buy spot, not futures, not leverage, spot buying. All right, guys. Now, real quick, just a quick break. You worked hard to protect your crypto and your data. Guys, said this before, don't be a dumb dumb and let one bad click undo it. NordVPN is the first line of defense. It hides your IP, encrypts your data, and keeps you one step ahead of scammers and trackers. And here's a pro tip. Literally, I showed you guys when I did it before on a video. I saved over $300 on my last trip. Most people never realize they're being overcharged simply because where their IP location is or where they where they live. So guys, it's a no-brainer here. Protect your portfolio. unlock the full web wherever you are and save while you're at it. There's a link in the description, guys, to get four free months and over 70% off. They cost less than a cup of coffee every single month. Don't wait for the hack to learn the hard way. Use Nord like I do. Stay private, stay protected, and stay ahead. And now back to the show. All right, guys. And now a quick macro dashboard for the people like me who unless I'm using sequence aren't trading with leverage and we are in this for the longer hall. So this is the macro segment so we could talk about what's going on with the liquidity with the plumbing because if you're trying to understand why Bitcoin can stay bid or buy pressure even when political catalysts wobble you need to watch liquidity not the vibes guys. And you have USM2 which is like the liquidity baseline right it's the money supply and the latest print we have was in November and that was 22.32 trillion dollars now that matters because broad money growth tends to lead risk assets over time not dayto-day but over quarters global M2 which is even a bigger tide and if you aggregate the big four the US Euro zone China and Japan global M2 is roughly $97 trillion and the 3mon month change is about 1% up. Now, that's global liquidity. It's not exploding, but it's not contracting either. It's stabilizing and slowly rising. And that seems to add up with what we're seeing from the federal balance sheet as well. Quantitative tightening is over. And are we going into a stage of kind of stealth easing? Well, the the Fed total assets are about $6.57 trillion on the latest weekly report. Still lower versus last year. So this is not a QE is back moment, but the more important part is the plumbing. The plumbing is the part that moves markets quietly. So let's talk about that for a second. We got the reverse repo that dropped roughly from $462 billion to about $328 billion recently. That's cash leaving the Fed's parking lot and re-entering the system. Then you got the TGA, the Treasury General Account, and it also dropped from about 873 billion to about 784 billion. That's basically fiscal cash getting spent into the economy instead of sitting idle. We also have what the Fed is doing right now. The New York Fedes has a schedule to buy over $55 billion in treasuries between mid January and midFebruary. Reinvestments plus reserve management purchases. Again, this is not a QE headline, but it is liquidity management that can support risk assets at the margin. So guys, the big picture for holders is we're not in a massive liquidity boom yet, but the headwinds have eased. M2 is steady, moving slightly up. The reverse repo is draining. The TGA is drawing down, and the Fed is actively managing reserves. That's why Bitcoin can stay bid or in a buy position even when political catalysts like the Clarity Act get delayed. You got spot demand and improving liquidity plumbing which beats narratives. And I've seen a lot of you guys have been very kind of negative in the comments. That's fine. I I I don't actually disagree with you guys who said this is a fake out. We just don't know yet. What I would love to see for me is I would love to see again that we close the weekly above that 94.5 to 95 zone. So we would like to see that it could even hit it, retest it, bounce off of it. Would love to see that it's just defended at that 94.5. It would get us out of that long-term kind of range that we kept going back to that 87.5 uh and maybe set us up for the next like higher. We also want to watch ETF flows and see they remain positive. They don't have to be $800 million every day. They don't have to be 500 million, but they should be positive. We also want to see that leverage stays controlled. Coin allies shows open interest is up. Funding is positive. Liquidity is not insane. It's fine. If funding rips and open interest balloons while price stalls, that's late cycle behavior. We're nowhere near that. And if this is a fake out scenario, what we want to look for, what breaks the bullish case is if we lose that 94 to $95,000 and we can't break back above it. And if the ETF flows, if they cool sharply or flip negative and if open interest stays elevated while price chops, then you get the liquidation move the other way. Right? What helped us pump was shorts getting liquidated and causing a short squeeze moving us up. The opposite can happen too if we drop down below that zone. And I'll say it clean, guys. If we're holding support with real inflows, dips are the opportunities. You've seen that today. If we lose support while flows fade and leverage stays crowded, that's how you guys get a trap door. What I'll be watching, what we'll be covering here is, well, we'll we'll still be covering big news that happens. We'll still be covering what's going on, but this is going to be the strategy. We're going to watch and see what's happening moving forward to kind of get a get an idea on the big picture and on a shorter time frame too if you guys are interested on what's happening. So if you want to take initiative into your own hand, what do you want to watch to be early and not reactive when these happens? Well, you want to keep watching the daily ETF flows. You want to watch open interest and funding together crowding the gauge. Any concrete reschedule update from the Senate banking which is necessary on top of the agriculture committee that we talked about, right? So when is this next going to actually happen? When is the next meeting to decide clarity? And then of course we have FOMC at the end of the month on the 27th and 28th. But we believe that's already likely priced in. So it's probably a nothing burger unless there's a decision made unless PAL just goes up or down on rates. But right now the market is pricing in no rate cuts, no change whatsoever. And if you guys really want to be ahead of it, keep one eye on the liquidity plumbing we just covered, the RRP, the TGA, and the Treasury purchase schedule because those moves don't show trends on Twitter, but they absolutely show up in price. And if you guys don't want to go watch that yourself, don't worry about it. Uh we'll be tracking that guys for you. Just make sure you subscribe and have your bell notifications on to make sure that you can stay on top of what's going on. So here's the takeaway, guys. Clarity, well, it got postponed. Deal breaker, absolutely not. It was just a test for us and that removes a clean headline catalyst but that's coming up again probably toward the month or who knows it might be postponed again again to me the most important part is that we get clarity right we don't rush it but Bitcoin didn't fall apart amongst all of that because the market has second engine right now institutional spot demand is through the roof right now on ETFs and we've been expecting that for a long time you 2026 was going to be a bullish year 2026 liquidity was coming back. This is the earliest signals of that happening. And in the background, you have these liquidity headwinds and they've eased enough for that spot bid to actually matter. If we keep holding this key support zone and flow stay positive, guys, the path of least resistance is up. So guys, let me know. I mean, if you guys watch the videos every day, great. I appreciate the comments from yesterday. Even though a lot of you guys thought this was a fake out, does this change anything for you guys? Do you guys still think it's a fake out? I saw some of you guys saying we're going to $70,000. you know, if that happens for me, the more likely scenario is, and let me know in the guys, guys, also if you want me to make a video on a black swan scenario, but I do think that like rather than us just going back down to 70,000 because the charts say that we have to go back down. To me, geopolitical risks are real right now. And that's something I don't want to discount, right? I think that something that we definitely should acknowledge. And so if you're playing with leverage, be very, very careful because it's been a long time since the world has been this uncertain where we stand right now on the kind of well, you know, as America calls it, the Department of War. So anyway guys, that's going to wrap it up today. I hope they're having a phenomenal day. It does look like to me this looks like a strong natural spot bid, which is really healthy for our markets, and it's also helping to validate what we've been talking about here on this channel for a long time. The four-year cycle that we've known is likely done for. And this what we've seen this correction since October was in my opinion a midcycle correction. And 2026 is going to be a great year for all of us. All right guys, that's it for today. Stay sharp. Continue to stack your Satoshi's. I'll catch you guys on the next one. See you.",
