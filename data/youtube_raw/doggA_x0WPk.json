  "transcript": "Well, it's certainly getting risky out there in the cryptoverse, right? We see Bitcoin threatening some of those key levels that we spoke about yesterday where we said that if you do start to see price taking out Tuesday the 13th of January's low, well, that would be time to get out because you're probably going a whole lot lower. In today's video, we'll have a look at how much lower you likely to go. Is it all over? Is the local top in? Are we going lower? And if so, how much lower? Smash the like button. Let's get straight into it. Surprisingly, unbelievably, on the hourly, some of these coins are bouncing. But if you do look at the daily, well, that's going to be a bit of a a different picture for the top 100 coins with a lot of them coming down now in the double digits. So, we are coming into a super critical key level of support. But if this next level is lost, well, ultimately going to have to look out down below for much much lower. We'll talk about that today. Again, guys, smash the like button as well. Vote on the poll over there. Um, and we'll go straight into the show content. Looking at gold first and foremost, extending the gains. Now, I want to be clear, I haven't actually taken any profits over here. This was take profit level one that we're atteing to take profits, but I told you previously that based on how we approach this level over here. I think this could slingshot through and begin to accelerate a little bit more. And it's one of the first times as well that we're starting to see gold putting in higher gains than silver, where silver is usually leading the moves, right? So maybe um it's time for gold to play a little bit of catch-up and we can start to extend into some of these higher targets over here. So based on the way we've approached this, I haven't yet taken any profits. Typically, I'd shave about 25 to 30% off at the first intended target. Since entering this trade over here, um we are now up and of course we've entered this trade many times over the last couple of years. 14.42% upside gain over there. We're looking to take 25% price move from entry to that final take profit. If we look at silver, still bullish, very very very strong continuation higher over here. Previous stop losses had been placed um you know below those lows. I think that now you can pretty much start to raise that bar and trail that stop loss at about 91.33. You do want to see continuation. Consider taking profits as well if you were in this trade. And then quick look at platinum. still waiting for this one to get going, but platinum um you know, hanging around and starting to apply pressure. The first candle that closes on a daily above 2,413, which basically means that you're going to close above these highs, that will be your confirmation that platinum is ready to extend the gains further alongside what we've seen in other commodities like gold and silver. So, all in all, that's looking good. We'll have a quick look at the stock market. Stock market starting to come down, right? And um you'll start to see a lot of posts over there identifying patterns that we saw in uh you know prior times like this. This was tariffs as the tariff pressure started to build up into the um beginning of 20125. We led to that massive downfall. We then had an absolutely face melting rally towards the upside and now it's starting to wedge right the S&P 500 is starting to move into that rising wedge with a bit of a slowdown. If this does start to fall out, well, you can expect a lot further downside probably. Um, you know, main key support area, strong strong horizontal coming in between 6,000 and 6,200. Am I calling for that right here right now? No, of course not. But that would be the main level to watch, right? So if we have a look over here just to measure that out as a price move well that takes you around 10% downside which given that Bitcoin and crypto are showing a lot more weakness relative to other markets that could be pretty um you know devastating for the crypto market where you would see a lot further downside. So we'll keep an eye on that. uh Dow Jones still extending the gains. It's been one of the stronger ones, but of course um on both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, we've effectively reached some of those main take-profit zones over there. So, you should have banked a lot of profits. Tesla, of course, will be on struggle street alongside the rest of the equity markets. Um if we do start to see breakdowns over there on the S&P 500, such as this rising wedge over there, then you can expect that Tesla would start to break down, which is why we said have a tight stop loss, right? have a tight stop loss over there. Apple still printing for us on the short trade. We'll talk about adjustments that I've made as well um to these positions that we have. Nothing in the equities, nothing in the commodities. All of those positions remain. Nothing has been changed over there. Uh Micro Strategy as well still hanging about barely got any kind of a relief just coming into this zone over here as resistance. And this one could extend those losses further if you're a hodler, right? if you're in a short trade like us will extend your profits even further. So one thing to keep an eye on and another thing is the return on investment. We current currently following the purple trajectory over there. So, you know, the expected outcome is unfortunately a slow bleed down. And we're seeing that we're seeing that if you look over here at the Google search trends and what's interesting now in Google Trends, you can actually um you can toggle between web searches and YouTube, which is really nice, right? So, you can see the YouTube searches also tanking coming towards the downside over the last five years. Web searches over there um also rolling over over the last five years. So um there is you know complete apathy in the market and just complete lack of interest. So that interest is still um around. It's just rotated into other markets such as the equities, such as the commodities, gold, silver, stealing the show. And then in terms of crypto, well, you know, Poly Markets is surging, right? If you look at Poly Markets, which is a betting site, uh you know, built on crypto on chain, this has started to move towards the upside alongside Kulshi, which is another prediction market. So people are betting, right? they're getting directional bias based on on the betting sites over there. So looking at Bitcoin, we spoke about this. I just want to highlight this over here. This is previously where we had that relief rally and we said that there's some at least similarities that are reminiscent of that prior time back in 2022 January where you rallied all the way up into March and then you put in a major top. We spoke about the timing already which was nine bars. Nine bars from bottom to top of that rally. And maybe this one was slightly front run where we put in the low November last year and then we went in for the eighth bar. Now the ninth bar this week and maybe this is going to start to fade. If you want further confirmation of that, well, as soon as you start to trade below the red line and I'll show you what it looks like on the total cryptocurrency market cap as well, that is taking out $90,000. We spoke about that yesterday. We said if you start to close candles below $90,000, that's going to be a bearish sign. That's going to look like a major rejection. Remember, that rejection was also coming off of both the 21 EMA and the 50 EMA, which are currently downtrending over there. So, you'd have a hard rejection off of those levels. And once you take this level out, that starts to look like a confirmed local top. Um, which will probably hold for at least a while. Not necessarily forever, but at least a while. Now, if you look at the total cryptocurrency market cap, it's the same thing. Remember, we spoke about this candle across the board. This is the candle that occurred um on Tuesday the 13th of Jan. You didn't want to take out that candle. Both Bitcoin on the daily as well as total on the daily has now taken that level out. And now you need to be looking out for 3.02 trillion. If you take out that 3.02 02 trillion on a closing basis, you have a whole lot of liquidity over here that could be swept and you could be easily easily visiting at least the bottom of that trading range, possibly even further down. Now, if you can sweep that trading range when it comes to the total cryptocurrency market cap, you're going to have a clear range level over here. So, I'll put it in a different color for you. Let's make that um we'll put it in let's put it in yellow. There we go. We'll put that in yellow. If at a later date you sweep that range and then reclaim, we would view that as bullish and will give bulls another chance to send price higher. But for now, understand this. As soon as you take out that level, high probability coming back down for that low at 2.81 trillion. And just to give you a general idea, um let's put that back on yellow. Let's give you a general idea of the percentages, right? Of the percentage change over there. Um let's put that in yellow. There we go. You would be looking at from current price down to there about another 7.8% right 7.8%. Which means USDT dominance might have the chance to break up. Our bias has been that the medium to high time frame USDT dominance is most likely going to trade up between 7.5 and 8% into this zone and then we can always re-evaluate. But we expecting this to break up higher and that is going to affect the rest of the market. So we can see the market is still heavily short with the majority of market participants on the short side. We have 52.7% short versus 47.73 long giving you a 4.53% difference or skew over there. Uh fear and greed down to 32 market still in uncertainty in terms of the funding rate. If you can start to red line into no capitulation panic zones on the funding rates while simultaneously hitting those key supports, that could provide a little bit of an opportunity, especially especially especially if it coincides with that sweep, right? That sweep and reclaim with the funding rates going incredibly negative over there. Fear and greed resetting as well. That would be a good sign, but we haven't yet seen that. We still have very, very, very low liquidations and low volume. Look at that. volume is diminishing alongside of course the interest in the market. Of course they go hand in hand, right? Um if interest goes down, people are trading less. That means that volume goes down and if volume is going down, you cannot have a sustainable rally within the market. And that's why we said that we expecting the ETF flows or outflows, I should rather say, to pick up. Um and we'll see. We'll see what happens over there, right? So we expect those ETF flows to pick up negative deltas over here on the really granular level when it comes to the majors BTC, ETH, and Salana. Again, just confluence and in agreement with what we're seeing over here on the funding rate. Confluence and agreement with what we're seeing in terms of the positioning. And when this gets really, really, really aggressive, that's where we can start to look for the counter trade. But it all comes with context, right? So, one bounce opportunity would be right here at the 50 EMA. Many traders would be looking at this, but I would definitely take this with a pinch of salt. And the reason why is mostly because you've taken out this candle anytime that you've basically full retraced a move. It's not going to be good for the psychology of the market and it increases the momentum or the ability for this level to break. So I'll just simply be an observer of price action at these levels and I wouldn't get too um you know interested in in just simply buying this up unless you're a super low time frame trader and you're actually looking for sculp entries. I think it's pretty dangerous because price has lost the short-term 50% level and um it's also below the RSI pivot level which is your yellow line. I'll just pop it up over there. That means as long as you're below that daily RSIs will trend down. And I do want to remind you of course um you guys know we're coming off of now the bare moon striking just on time and gravitating price towards the downside. So therefore I mentioned to the whale remembers based on what we're seeing over here with your momentum oscillator now this trend line starting to break down this can easily come down a whole lot more which means for price you could easily sweep down below that yearly open and that's where you want to watch that sweep of the bottom of the trading range. So if you can sweep into there, that's where I'd be looking to or I'd be more interested to do some business is if you can sweep that lower part of the range simultaneously doing the same thing on the total cryptocurrency market cap simultaneously extending the skew a little bit further whilst getting deeper negative funding over there showing just shorts are absolutely frothing by the mouth and going absolutely ballistic with big liquidations. Right? We want to see big liquidations on the long side maybe over a billion. uh well then there's a bit of hope and an opportunity to execute a trade. So, right now, this is just maybe the very very very start of what would be a deeper breakdown, dropping Bitcoin, you know, anywhere down to even the $80,000 region, right? We we need to gauge the momentum. The momentum as we're coming down, the momentum has only just turned on the daily over there. So, something to be cautious of and aware of, but price level wise, well, first level of interest, $89,000. That's your key 50% level when considering the bottom to the top of the trading range, right? So the local low to the local high. Next level of interest is around that yearly open. You got double confluence over there because your golden pocket the 618 and 65 fib is also over there. So that's pretty interesting. Um, but then there's something you need to be aware of because if these things start to get lost, such as the 50 EMA, such as the golden pocket, and you start to trade and gain acceptance below the bottom of the trading range, well, that's where real trouble comes into play because then you're talking about the bare flag breakdown, which we spoke about as well. failing of course over here at that 95k level which was your um point of control for the overall trading range over the last 12 months of price action from the inception of this move that drove price up. So price ranged between all those different levels and that is your volume point of control. you failed that. Which means which means which means if you lose this level, if you lose the bottom of the trading range level over here, not only have you rejected off of that key point, which is your green line, that point of control from volume standpoint, but also you'd be trading back below this um volume profile, which is meant to act as support, right? So you can see the little uh pink zone that shows you a lot of Bitcoin was traded at this point, which means it's a key psychological level. So, if you start to break below there and gain acceptance underneath that, well, here's your bare flag, right? There's your pole. Price comes down, consolidates into the flag, rejects, trades underneath the volume profile. Unfortunately, that takes Bitcoin down into the 50K zone. And I'm not calling it yet. We'll have to see. We have to gauge the momentum, but that's a real possibility and you should be aware of that if you're a crypto investor, Bitcoin investor. Volume dropping off. We got some optimism with that spike up, but then we said there was no holding above that green line, right? There was no holding above 95K and ever since then the volume continued to drop off. All totally in alignment with the apathy in the market with the daily exchange volume dropping off over here. So we'll see if that rolls over again and therefore that causes a lot of trouble. Now, a lot of this would be of of course um fueled as well, more aggressively fueled by what's going on with Trump and the tariffs and trying to take over Greenland and all of that. There's a lot of geopolitical things that are going on and that's partly why maybe gold is extending those gains because this is the true flight to safety. So, um you know, Bitcoin is meant to be gold 2.0, but maybe just not this decade, right? Maybe not yet. It's not acting like gold, that's for certain. They're actually trading completely inverse to each other. So, we'll go into a couple of the altcoins. I do also want to remind you, we'll do our giveaway today, the $1,000 giveaway. So, for those of you that signed up to Bit Unix, you all in on the draw. Um, I think for today, I wanted to give two people the opportunity to win. So, we're going to split it. We'll give $500 and $500 for anyone that did sign up to Bit Unix and make a deposit. if you haven't already and you want to participate in the next draw because I just need to see how long do we have. We have until the 31st of 31st of January and it's only for the first 1,000 users. So, you need to get in uh you know before the thousand users spot has ended. Once you have a,000 users um it's going to be capped in terms of the giveaways on the daily streams for the $1,000 giveaway. So, for any of you that were in on the previous ones, you have been funded, right? It was sent on the 16th. Sent on the 16th. You guys have been funded. So, let's do the next draw. The next draw, we're going from row number 57 down to row number 91. It's going to be randomized. If it lands, of course, on one of the yellow lines, which is a date, then you can't win. But if these are one of your user IDs, $500 is coming your way. it will be funded directly into your account because we have your user ID, right? That's why you have to sign up and deposit so we know you're real and not a bot and we have your user ID. So, let's go. Let's spin to win and then we'll get into some of the other coins. Um, row number 62. Let's see. Where's row number 62? This is randomly selected. Uh, congratulations. You won $500. And I'll zoom in just so you guys can see the user ID. So if your user ID is 496762164. So again 496762164. Um you won $500. What a return on investment. This guy only put in like 50 bucks. He just made a 10x just for signing up. So congratulations. Uh let's do another spin. One more $500 to go. Row number 81. Row number 81. Let's go to row number 81. Uh here it is. Congratulations. You also won $500. And your user ID number is 486763194. I'll say it again. 486763194. If that's you, congratulations. Um, you also got some pretty good returns over there. So, 500 bucks over 2x over there for you, okay? Just for making a deposit. So, if you want to participate in the next one, we'll do it again before the end of the week. Make sure that you sign up. Use this link in the description below. Otherwise, you will not be considered. And it's for the first 1,000 people. Remember, there's no KYC, which is the amazing thing about Bit Unix. No KYC. And you can trade things like gold. So, if you don't want to get a brokerage account, you can trade gold over there as well. So, win winner winner chicken dinner. Let's go. Let's get into some of the other things. Now, remember, one of the trade ideas that we had was to potentially go short on Tron based on this buildup of massive liquidity. And, you know, it's starting to break down. Could this be the moment? I think you can take less risk on over here if you do want to enter into this trade with just a tight stop loss now using the hourly back above there. So maybe that's a trade we should consider. We'll just enter in pretty much over here. Stop loss back above. If this starts to trade back above, maybe this is the moment we start to see that breakdown. It is a trade I'd be willing to take. So what changes have I made? Well, the one change that I made on uh these trades that we had set up over here was I closed the Ethereum position. And the reason why is because I believe that prices are probably going to start to head lower. We had already taken a lot of profit on Monero, which has been one of the strongest coins in the market. Um, I could take a little bit more. I'm going to leave it on the table. We've taken over half the position off already. I'm going to leave Monero. These are the only long. Monero is the only long and we had ETH. Uh, the rest of the market is other assets, right? Pippen I'm still short on. we paying in funding to be um short on this position, which is the only reason that this is in the red because price has already moved directionally uh in alignment with where we said it would. So, I think this is a worthwhile trade to take to suggest that um you know, this massive amount of liquidity here is now starting to get swept, right? You're beginning to break this down. You started to change structure, lower lows and lower highs on a low time frame, on an hourly basis. And if the rest of the market starts to come down and we see these red lines taken out on Bitcoin as well as total, it can fall through very quickly. So I think from a risk-to-reward perspective, it probably makes sense to consider entering into the Tron trade. Um because let me just fix that over there. we are only taking on a 2.537% price move against us to accept defeat and say that our short trade idea is wrong and we'll re-enter. So therefore, if this is going to be the start of the breakdown, I think I'm just going to go for it over here. Um even though you're coming into this trend support, it's more about the structure. Lower lows, lower highs, this could start to break down. It's very very very simple. Get back above here. Low time frame, it's going higher and then we can just invalidate on that trade. So, that will be the next trade that I'm going to take is TRX. It's Tron. Um, we'll go over here for that TRX. Uh, so TRX, we need to go to um I am on futures. Let me just try this all over again. So, we need USDT. There we go. TR TRX. There we go. There it is. TRX. We got Tron over here. We're going to go to our futures grid. We're going to go to short. Um, we are going to set the price range. And we may as well just look at it from here. There we go. We're going to set the price range. So, the highest price, uh, which is where we basically want to exit this trade, is going to be 3157 0.315. I'll go 58 over there. The lowest price is going to be where we intend to take profits all the way down at 2611. So, 0.2611. And I'm going to put in about 250 grids. There you go. That's your trade setup. And I'm not going to go too big because it's starting off as a shorter term trade. I'll just put in like $2,000 into this position over here. Um it's only like six or 5% of this account size and that's it. All right. So, that'll be my trade entry over here. So, I'm allowing margin to scale up a bit more on higher time frame confirmations of breakdowns. So, that is Tron. Okay. That's the one trade that we had eyed out for quite some time. Um, and very very very low risk on this because it could easily spike back up. I don't have higher time frame confirmations of reversals yet. Here's your daily. But this was the intended area into the 50% level. Rejected, right? Started to come down. Okay, cool. What else? Justin will come to squeeze all shortters. That is absolutely possible. If there's one person out there that has uh pockets deeper than Warren Buffett, it's probably him. He seems to never run out of money. I don't know where the money comes from. I don't know if he's secretly part of the Chinese government, but um if he wants to squeeze us, we are definitely getting squeezed, which is why we keep a tight stop loss over there. Justin Sun has endless money. Okay, next. What else? What else? Uh let's see. Let's see. Let's see. So, we'll have a quick look at Monero just because these are some of the other trades. So, I did mention this bounce zone over there, but I said I think it's going to struggle to get into or or through this level. And the main base case rejective zone is coming into the pink box. And that's exactly where it hit. Right between $650 and um $700 is where we said there's a very good chance that it will reject. It has started to come down. Uh is that the complacency bounce and this thing is going to continue to drop? It's really possible. I'm actually going to even take a little bit more profit off this just in case. So uh to take profit on these grid bots, you go to details over here. You scroll down to uh where it says more and then you can say add to or reduce your investment. So we're going to reduce the investment over there. I am going to take as much as another 25% profit on this trade. Okay. XMR um futures. Let me just double check. Yeah, it's the right one. And let's go. Let's go. Okay. So, a little bit more profit taken off over here on this trade. That is for XMR. Um, feel free if you want to do the same. If you do want to sign up to follow these grid bots, by the way, they're all linked below. It says Pinex over here. Uh, maybe hard if you in in the background there. You can just raise this to the top. But if you click on the strategies over here, there you go. You should be able to copy them. So, when the stream ends, what I'll do is I'll make sure Okay, I see we already have TRXes already on the list. So, it is available already to copy. If you want to copy that short trade, I see it's already reflected over there. Uh, would I flip the XMR bot to short? No, I would not. The reason I wouldn't is because it's still one of the strongest that's out there. I'm looking for things that are much weaker with confirmed breakdowns on high time frame uh before going short. And uh Monero is not one of those yet. It's still very high volatility and therefore very risky um to to short this. If you're a low time frame trader, absolutely you could probably short this all the way back down to the bottom of the range. But this may just range right on a high time frame. So if we go back on the daily, what you may see is even if it comes down, you know, this may just range like that, which would actually still be bullish for higher prices um later on. So that's why not willing to short. All righty. Um what other coins did we have over here that we needed to look at? Uh let's have a quick look at ETH. So ETH, we we took profits on this trade. We moved stops to break even and as I just mentioned to you, I closed what was remaining on this position. It hasn't actually taken out the low which occurred on Tuesday. So, it's relatively speaking, proportionally at least, a little bit stronger than Bitcoin for now. But I wouldn't hold my breath. There's a good chance that that's going to take out that low and then ultimately this is going to come back down um you know all the way back to the bottom of the range around 2,800 would be the price level for um for Ethereum. Okay. Um adding to Tesla is one of the questions over there for all rise moon mission 111 right quite a mouthful over here some of your guys um your your YouTube names. So adding to Tesla you could consider it but you have to be very wary of the the weakness in the rest of the market. You know this to me is now it's spending a lot of time here. It's almost spending too much time over here. So I must I must say that I think that you we we were debating is that going to be a lower high and ultimately this is going to trade lower like that. It's starting to look very heavy and very possible that that's what's going to happen. So personally I wouldn't be adding any more over here. What I have is what I have and if we trade down here I'm just going to stop out that trade and I'll just look for a new opportunity. Right? It is what it is. You cannot get through this game right this space this industry without taking losses. You have to uh mentally understand that it's part of the game, right? The same way that if you're a racing car driver, sometimes you're going to bump the other driver. Once in a while, you're going to bump the other driver. Your car is going to slide. You may scrape the side of it. These things are part of the game. It's going to happen. Okay. All righty. So, what else? What else do we have over here? 420 for um Yes, possibly 420. 420 for Tesla. We know that's Elon, one of Elon's favorite numbers over there. By the way, guys, if you want more information and a more handheld approach, you guys can always jump into Whail Room. Uh, this is where you can see I've been guiding everyone each step of the way. We're constantly going through all the trade ideas, talking about what we think is going to happen next. I'm not the only trader in there, right? There's a lot of different traders um that are professionally trading the markets. There is a link over here for anyone that has been asking and you want to get into whail room, it's over there. Okay, cool. Need to invite to copy on Pinex. Uh, I will disable that just after the stream. Like, uh, just give me a second once the stream ends. I'll disable it. Then you can just come through to the copy section and it should work for you. Okay. Uh, what about the privacy narrative? These are just narratives, right? That's the thing. You got to wrap your head around that. Crypto, the narratives are getting shorter and shorter and the rotations are happening quicker and quicker. The privacy thing, it's just simply a narrative. we uh read the other day. I may have dropped that in the Discord over here. Uh it was something around Let me just see if I had it over here. It was uh I don't know if I'm going to be able to find this now because I dropped so much information in here. that um around the privacy narrative, they showed that there was a lot of crypto that was hacked and basically people were washing that through Monero and Zcash and that could have been part of the reason why uh those charts were pumping, right? So, it's just a shortlived narrative. These things don't necessarily last very long and he needs to be aware of that. Okay. All right. Quick look at Salana chart as well. Let's go to the Salana chart. I know there's a question over there. So I said I believe Salana will probably trade back down to these lows and then ultimately your key support level is still this between 103 and 110. So that low $100 territory is where you want to see Salana begin to to bounce over there. Okay. Um all righty. What else? What else? What else? Let's see. Uh Dash Dash is probably going to start to give up its gains. I know that had that random pump out of nowhere. So, this would be one of those coins. Um, if you're a low time frame trader and you wanted to to gain that entry on a short trade, there would probably be an opportunity on something like Dash. Right there it is. So, that's probably it. The local top is probably in. Expect full retraces. Not necessarily in one go, but you know, over time, probably something like that. And a slow bleed down by March. You're probably sitting at new lows, trading below those lows on Dash. Okay. So that is Dash Micro Strategy we've covered. We said Micro Strategy is probably also going to continue down slowly but surely. All right. Slowly but surely it's going to just continue to bleed. Failure to get any real kind of relief rally over there on Micro Strategy. So I am continuing to hold that short trade over there.
