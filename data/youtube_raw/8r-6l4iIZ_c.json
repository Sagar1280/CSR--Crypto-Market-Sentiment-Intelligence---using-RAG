  "transcript": "It's looking very risky out there for the crypto bulls, the Bitcoin bulls as well. We started to see a breakdown of some of those key levels that we spoke about yesterday where we said you do not want to lose those levels. If you do start to lose those levels, there could be mass acceleration towards the downside. In today's video, I want to talk about the key trigger point that you can have a look at um where if we if we close at least two more candles underneath this zone, you can expect the probability is much higher than not that you are going to see continuation down. We'll talk about the golden platinum breakout. Gold extending the gains further, hitting some of those key targets that we had marked out. Uh this is now TP level two out of the three TP zones, take-profit zones that we had. I haven't yet taken any profits because we said there was a lot of momentum coming into that trade. Uh platinum as well breaking above the key level that we outlined. We'll have a look at equities which could potentially be starting to roll over and that's going to um of course put crypto and bitcoin even further even deeper down into those dark waters and trouble street. Um and then we'll outline some of the trades that we took. One of which we took live on the show yesterday that being Tron breaking down with price what to do with that trade. Stay tuned until the end. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Smash the like button. Please vote as well. I'd love to know from your guys' perspective. What do you think happens next? Right. We got bounce here, set a lower high, and then down from that point to 49% of you believe that to be the case. 16% of you believe we're just going to have a full-on reversal and trail back towards the upside. And then we got 31% of you saying down she goes with equities and 3% believe something else. All you have to do is let us know in the comments if you do believe something else. So, let's go. Starting off over here with this. This is now the take-profit zone too that we had marked out. Now, no, it's not an as shiny object as many believe in terms of like Bitcoin and other markets, but nevertheless, it's doing the job. It's providing the profits. Uh we have about 24% on the table from entry to final take profit over there. And we've now hit this target over here. You can see a little bit of rejection coming off of those zones. That being one of the target zones that we had. So question is, is it wise to take profit over here or should we just continue to hold on? I'm going to give it today. I haven't taken any profits. I'm going to continue to maintain my exposure. We do have a stop loss underneath, which means we'd be giving up a decent portion of those profits if this were to flash down like that. Even if it were to flash down, I do believe that you'd probably find support coming back into the range breakout level for gold. Uh so it would look something like this and then you'll probably lead to further continuation. So, for now, I'm going to monitor this throughout today. Um, we can have a look as well at platinum. Platinum started to break out. I told you if you get a daily candle close above that red line over there, which we got, I would expect continuation and a repricing back into platinum where we should see this um moving up higher as well. So, platinum looks really, really good. We have silver, which in my opinion is starting to get really, really risky. We're also trailing a stop loss over here on the red line that's coming in at 90.911. So um somebody called the ambulance right 911 90.91 if that gets taken out I think silver will come down quite hot but for now it is a parabolic move I think everybody knows and understands that these are parabolas and they'll probably break down at some point um probably within this quarter right before the end of March so for now at stop losses are pretty tight trailing all of these prices over here then we need to talk about equities they're starting to roll over. Um, QQQ is the weakest. NASDAQ is the weakest of the three. So, maybe let's just start with that straight away. Remember, we were attempting a breakout trade over here. We stopped out early on this trade, so there's no loss over there. And this is the reason you want to utilize a stop loss, right? Because now trailing underneath this yellow box over here, price action closing and opening below that could easily, easily, easily, easily start to break down and then your massive targets towards the downside. I'm actually curious to see how the Fibonacci levels line up with this. But of course, the one obvious level is going to be um this uh horizontal support. Horizontal supports are always very significant to me. And that's coming in at about 530. And then what we can do is assuming that that's a top and we're starting to roll over and you're putting in um you know a local top over there. Uh let's quickly see how that's going to line up with from low to high. So, you can see that 50% level, which is always significant to us, is coming in just below that box, which means that's if things get really, really ugly. Percentage-wise, what would you be looking at percentage- wise? Um, this could drop 14, 15%. That would be pretty catastrophic for Bitcoin and it would take Bitcoin, in my opinion, down into the $50,000 zone, which would also be the confirmation of a bare flag breakdown. Arnold coming in the chat over there, you know, can we short it? Of course, you can definitely short it. If these things start to roll over, you can definitely short it. We have taken a bunch of short trades over there. Um, we can quickly have a look at them. So, short trades on the table that we have right now. Tron short, Pippen short, Apple short, which has paid big bucks, and Micro Strategy short, which has also paid big bucks. So, we are holding those positions. Personally, I'm not looking to allocate any more risk into new short positions. The trades that I have is the trades that I have. um if something you know standing out like an absolute sore thumb I would be willing to take it but for now I'm just going to continue to maintain these and uh you know spot exposure in the form of USDT right so USDT just holding that USDT waiting to get into other positions at a later stage so we have seen the S&P 500 as well taking out the red line we didn't want to see that that's 6866 that level's taken out you haven't broken below the yellow box which I will remind you QQQ has already done. The NASDAQ's already below that line. Um, of course, a lot weaker and even the Dow Jones, which has been more recently a lot stronger than the other markets. This is starting to come down as well, taking out some of those lows, but you do have key support levels coming into play. I would raise this bar over here. If you start to break below 48,000 on the Dow Jones, expect this is going to have a bit of a rollover effect. So, one of the trades I had to stop out on was Tesla. I took the early loss this morning. Um I think inevitably you're going to take this level out. You have started to break this trend line over here and therefore one of the worst case scenarios would be that this is a big deviation um of a major key level. If you deviate and close multiple candles below this could easily fall through. So I'm not going to go through targets or too many details over here. Very simply put in order to reposition back into strength for Tesla. What would need to be seen is a reclaim and a recovery back above these highs at 450. Give it a bit of time, let it digest the move, let it reset. Um, and then you can start to look for new positions. Three candles closing underneath this trend line over here. So, one, two, three candles in this vicinity would increase the likelihood that this is going to start to break down um quite quickly. So, for now, I've taken the loss. I'm out on that trade, but any of the losses that I incurred over there are definitely covered in the form of profits, which I've gained on Apple, for example. Apple almost hitting that final take profit down at 235. So all in all, everything is looking good over there. We got Tesla stopped out. Apple almost at final TP. And then I want to talk a little bit about other things. Google looking a little bit scary, right? So let's go over onto the Google chart. For now, it's been a face melting up trend. But the reason I say it looks scary is because um you know the quicker you go up, the quicker you come down. And this has been an absolutely face melting move um for uh Google. So, if Apple, if Alphabet, Google starts to break down and confirm some um change in direction or change of structure over here with lower lows and lower highs, well, ultimately I'm going to be looking way further down. We don't have a trigger, but I guess as per the question in the comments over there, can you short? Well, if you did want to short and you believe that things are going to start to break down, this is going to come down quite aggressively. Uh, you know, in theory, you could probably enter into a short trade over here at 322 and you can just float your stop loss. I would even say at 336 you would have a very very very tight stop loss. If this liquidity starts to get taken this will be aggressive. It will do something like that. So you can imagine from a risk-to-reward perspective um entry over here stop loss over here TP somewhere down here. Very favorable odds probably giving you about a five to a 7:1 risk-to-reward ratio. Meaning for every $1 that you risk you stand to gain $5 to $7. That's a bit of a trade idea. I'm not taking it. Again, I've made it clear the positions I'm in, I'm happy with. I'm just going to continue to hold them. No changes needed over there. Then we have to talk about Micro Strategy as well. Micro Strategy, one of the only buyers of Bitcoin, coming out with a massive buy yesterday, $2.13 billion. That's absolutely insane. But yet, the Micro Strategy chart continues its journey down. um rejecting off this key level, failed attempts at a relief rally, and straight away down it goes. Once it starts to threaten these lows at 149, you're probably going to accelerate a bit further. Um we nailed this trade absolutely perfectly if you participated in with this. Let me know in the comments section. Um a big congratulations to all of you that that did take this trade. Um it was very difficult to take at the time. I was definitely getting a lot of hate for this trade. Some people even DM'd me, right? Um all righty. So the fact uh you know the I guess the greater risk factor over here is for Bitcoin because if Micro Strategy is the only buyer putting in these massive buys yet price continues to go down they're almost immediately underwater and that's a massive risk for them and therefore it just shows the weakness of the overall crypto market. The other thing that's looking relatively weak which I wanted to discuss and I think could come down quite aggressively is Robin Hood. So, Robin Hood threatening this trend line over here. We spoke about it. Multiple tests into this trend line. One, two, three, coming in for that fourth test. Candle open and close below here. This could easily drop down to about $65 as per my little lop lines that I've drawn out over there. So, therefore, again, if you do want another short trade just to hedge, maybe you just want to take the short trade simply to hedge your positions. Well, of course, an obvious stop would be over there at 121 and you could easily short this down to about 65. Therefore, this is giving you a $2.5 to1 risk-to-reward ratio. So, for $1 risk, you stand to make $25. Of course, a better entry would be if you do get something like that that rallies up. This would drastically change your risk. Um, now you'd be looking at about a 8 to1 risk-to-reward ratio, but nevertheless, I'll leave that trade idea on the table for you guys just in case somebody's missed out and you do want a trade opportunity. um maybe just to hedge. Again, even if it is just to simply hedge, you basically don't want this to to get back above 121 and holding underneath this level. This thing could fall through super super quick. So, I'll very quickly just run through some of the other stocks over here. Um Nvidia also losing the key mid-range level. That's calling therefore for about 150. That could come down a lot. Meta has been horrible. Probably going to create new lows. Microsoft on its way back to 409. Um Amazon also losing the range high over there. This can easily come back down to the range low about 182. Circle uh coming in probably for new lows. I would expect that very soon. Coinbase threatening this parallel channel. A loss of this parallel channel means Coinbase down to about 163. And of course, if there's a lack of volume, which I can tell you for a fact within the markets, it means Coinbase is probably not making that much money. And therefore, you do have to look for low prices. So, these are some of the things we're looking at. I love to see this. by the way, made $7,000 on Micro Strategy short from BMBB228. Congratulations. Um, let me know, guys. Let me know your wins. We we it's very transparent over here. I talk about the losses as well. But if you guys have been winning big off of the trades, let me know. Um, I would love to see it. Right. Natural gas, one of the questions over there. I did see natural gas had a massive move up. We can have a look at it. When I say massive, that is really massive. 21.55% up. Uh but there's no real trade for me over here if you in on this trade. Of course, you can expect resistance coming in at about 680. So uh that is that right? Let's move on into Bitcoin. The levels have lost. The levels have been lost. The red line we said you don't want to break back below there and um and especially not close under there on a weekly. Daily is already done the job. It's already closed below $90,000. This is a massive risk factor where you could start to see a deeper breakdown and therefore even if you are bullish at the key support levels. Um you know you have to look at the preceding trend which is down and therefore this is a massive risk factor following that move down. So we've seen that on Bitcoin, we've seen on total as well the breakdown. Now there are some potential bounce zones coming in at about 2.81 trillion uh for the total cryptocurrency market cap. Again, I think it looks very very very weak. And the fact that you have one of the only big buyers coming out with a massive order, 2.13 billion, and immediately it's down. Uh it's not a good sign. It just shows you don't fade the cycles, right? The cyclical path that things tend to follow, which is about 1,080ish to 1,100 days of a bull run from bottom to top. And then you're looking at about 365 days of, you know, a downtrend with bounces in between. And that's currently the trajectory following is the purple popping on and off the screen over there. It's very, very, very similar. Look at that. Nothing has really changed. So maybe you'll find an intram low uh in the coming days and weeks and then a little bit of a bouncy bounce and then of course you just continue that journey further down to to finish off the bare market. So I posted this as well in the Discord and I said posted without comments. I can throw that same comment to you guys. Post it without comment. What do you think comes next? If this is a five minute chart, what are your thoughts? Right. Well, you've lost the seven moving average on the monthly chart. You've lost the 20 moving average on the monthly chart. And you can see that's looking like a hard rejection. If we start to close this candle red, uh the natural expectation would be acceleration down towards the 50 MA, which is moving towards the upside. that you would probably even break through that just like we did in the prior cycle when we found those FTX lows. Now, this won't happen overnight. All I'm suggesting is focus on this chart. If this were a 5 minute or 15 minute or 1 hour chart, what would you be doing? Would you be longing or would you be shorting or would you just be sitting on the sidelines waiting for some key levels to get hit? Personally, I'd be waiting for key levels to get hit. Something like that. That would be my expectation. Just drawing little quick lines. What does that look like? 30 to 50k somewhere within that vicinity. I've expressed the levels that I'm targeting on previous streams. That's why you must make sure that you watch every single day. Going on to the USDT dominance. Again, this could lead to the breakout if we do start to break down very very soon. And we'll get into a little bit more depth when it comes to um the daily analysis on Bitcoin. We should know soon, very very soon. If there's validity behind the bare flag on Bitcoin, well, we should have that confirmation of the breakdown really soon. And then I'm expecting USDT dominance up into the 8% region. So, there is a big discrepancy over here or skew between the longs and the shorts with negative 4.5%. We did hit the criteria of what I was looking for in terms of the liquidations hitting over 1 billion and majority of those came from the long side, 822 million. So those were some of the things we're looking for. But if you have a look over here, the um funding rates over here. So you know if if you want to click on this and have a look, true positioning index is what we've labeled this. The true positioning index is just looking at the funding is sitting in uncertainty which is showing you that there are still a lot of longs that are trying to buy the dip over here. So it's not aggressively short. We need to see capitulation like signals um while simultaneously in you know capitulation or extreme extreme extreme fear on the Bitcoin sentiment. We recently just tick back into that zone at 24 with a big skew. We've got some of the telltale signs but you always need to understand and utilize the context and the context is that the trend is your friend till the end of the trend and price action or price structure trumps every other indicator. These are confluent factors that we like to use alongside price action analysis and the price action is very very very bearish. It still is daily exchange volume struggling over there. Um you had a little bit of an uptick but mostly due to the increase in liquidation of longs over there. So more activity on exchanges but that's not necessarily a positive thing. This is is still just bleeding out right bleeding out all the way down. Lower lows, lower highs. I'm expecting more ETF outflows as well. probably even negative on the week for this week um given the losses that have been incurred. So those are the main things that we're looking at. Remember the site over here for you guys to use is totally free. You can see what our traders are doing as well in whail room on the left hand side over here. And our number one trader for the day um is trader Clary 77 with a 1,73% profit. So congratulations and that's a long trade on silver. They're actually long silver over there in WHM. Yesterday in WHO, I posted this. I said that expectation would be a quick move down into the yearly open. We've effectively seen that, right? We've effectively seen that. There it is, the move down into the early open. Now, with this little bit of a bounce over here, I actually think that um it's an easy short opportunity with a stop loss above yesterday's candle high. If you're not already in a short trade, uh you know, I I don't think it's going to stop here. Personally, I think that you're probably going to see continuation down, especially especially if the stock market rolls over where we seeing some of that weakness, right? We've seen some of that weakness over there. So, um, moving on, looking at Bitcoin, we spoke about the one level of support. So, this is just confluent with this. Take out that red line, take out that red line. It's not going to be a good sign. And then we go back to Bitcoin over here, and we said, well, um, there is support, but it's weak, and you're having multiple tests into this key level. So, I personally think it's going to be swiped. That's 1 2 3 and four. Now, closing underneath this zone over here. Again, I just said you could theoretically have a short stop loss if you want to hedge against positions. All you need to see Bitcoin do um well, let's just quickly say not now. All you need to see Bitcoin do is to recover and get back above that candle. This is your breakdown candle. This means that any little bounce over here is most likely going to fail and you're probably going to see that continuation further down. So, closing multiple candles underneath that 50 EMA is looking like a hard rejection, right? A hard rejection from the 50 and 200 EMA over there. You didn't even quite make it that high and it is getting very risky. And this is your bare flag. And I do want to remind you the bare flag does have a measured move. Unfortunately, this is the truth. 56,500. I say unfortunately, but to tell you the truth, it's very fortunate because this is the only way that I make money in the markets is by buying low, selling high, and re-entering when that asset comes down once again. And I'm very, very thankful for the volatility. The more volatility, the bigger the swings, and the quicker they happen, the more money I can make quickly. So therefore, multiple candle closes underneath that 50 EMA with this angling down will confirm the bare flag breakdown. Now again, don't um you know, don't bet the farm on this because of course patterns can morph and change, but closing multiple candles underneath this $86,000 zone over here is going to be losing the volume support. We spoke about this volume support yesterday. We said the rejection of the point of control that we had labeled already months ago. We started to come down over there. We've threatened now into the bottom of that flag. And if we start to close multiple candles underneath that 50 EMA, you'll simultaneously be losing your volume profile support over here and then you're going back down to the bottom of the range. Yes, there'll probably be a little bit of a bounce. I could see it doing something like this. Move down to 80K, maybe a little bit of a a throwback into resistance, a move down to 70K, strong technical support, probably another lower high, and then continuation down um you know for the end of the quarter. That is if there's validity behind this bare flag. The bare flag has validity because every rally has mostly been failed or met with a drop off in volume. So that's something that you want to be aware. Therefore, bulls rarely have their work cut out for them. All I'm suggesting is bulls need to get back above this candle to get any sort of um and I'm actually going to price label that level for you. 92,849. If they can get back above that level over there, uh we can talk. We can talk again. Otherwise, bulls don't even talk to me. There's nothing to discuss over here. You're wrecked and you're probably going to get more wrecked, unfortunately. Right. Let's go review what the polls are saying. So, vote over there on the polls. Uh, bounce here and then lower. 46% of your full upside reversal. Still 15% of you who who need to prove me wrong. All you need to do that 15% to get me on your side is just get back above 92,849. That's all that I need to see. Um, no disrespect to anyone. This is why we have a market because there's two sides, right? We we need longs and we need shorts and that's what creates a market for us. And then we got 36% of you down only. So smash the like button there guys and we'll get into into the altcoins. If anyone wants to take this trade, by the way, if you're looking for a short trade over here, I'm not really a fan of shorting, you know, late. Um we we had already taken our short trades with Micro Strategy being the um call it the higher beta play where we thought that if Bitcoin goes down, Micro Strategy will go down much harder. The same way that people take the opposite side on Micro Strategy when it's a bull run. You get much bigger returns. So, I can take on less leverage or even a slightly slightly um short position on Micro Strategy and it will pay out dividends versus heavy heavy strong high leverage long uh shorts, excuse me, on on Bitcoin, right? But if you do want to take this trade, you can take it on gravity. Guys, remember I do want to remind you you there is currently an airdrop to be farmed over here. So, if you did want to take this trade over here, stop loss goes above yesterday's um high point of that candle, which is about basically you can put it at the exact high exact exact high 92,885. If you get back above that level, you stop out the short trade. If the bare flag is going to break down, well, you should get paid a lot of money in the coming days and weeks and you'll be farming the airrop over there. So, that is all linked in the description below. Um, gravity in partnership with ZK sync. So zero knowledge rollups over there and I do want to go into altcoins right I have a few things to discuss the Monero rejection that's one thing to discuss the Tron short trade in the money on point another thing to discuss Pippen short trade also in the money another thing to discuss I've got uh hype some take-profit zones also coming into those key levels that we spoke about and then XRP which is looking pretty brutal so those are the altcoins that I want to discuss let Let me know in the comments if there's something else that you guys want to have a look at uh and we'll get into it. So, starting off going on to the hourly monero. We spoke about this high probability rejection zone rejected down it goes. We took a lot of profits. Now, you are going to be approaching key support. So, I definitely wouldn't be shorting Monero over here because I do think that um you'll probably get a bit of a technical bounce out of this zone. you'll set another lower high most likely in this 560 580 zone and then you can probably take a little bit more profit over there on the long trade or re-enter onto a short trade if you haven't already. So that's the one thing is Monero. The other thing is Pippen. Pippen is in the money, right? Pippen is in the money. The trade is playing out. We um have almost almost tagged that first take profit. TP1 23 cents, TP2 168, TP3 uh 0.0733 and then you can just leave the remainder on the table for 18 0.018 that is. So that's what I'm looking at on Pippen. Just follow the simple price structure. The stop loss over here should now be safe. I wouldn't necessarily move it to break even, but rather just float it above those previous highs over there. Um and and we'll give it a chance to see if this thing holds. It's obviously a very manipulated coin that whoever the founders are hold a massive portion of the supply. So they could easily margin long that and liquidate a bunch of us, but I don't necessarily think there's too many people in the world following the short trade. So you may as well just continue to hold short. I think it's just a matter of time before trades down to 0.01822. So that's the pip and short trade. The next trade that we had to discuss over there was Tron. So for Tron, what we'll do is we'll go on to also the hourly. There it is. Remember, we took this live on stream yesterday. I also believe your stop loss is totally intact over here. Um, and is very very very unlikely to get hit. So close to TP1. I'm just going to continue to maintain my short exposure over here. I think this might bounce up a little bit like 30 um, you know, to 31 somewhere around there. 31 and then ultimately down it goes again to 29 28 27 and then finishes off at 26. So that is for Tron. There's your high time frame. This was the complacency bounce that we're looking at into that 50% level. Up 200% on the Tron short, says Shauna. Well done. Congratulations. Uh we got in on that trade perfectly, perfectly perfectly. So you can see my stop similar to what I've outlined for Bitcoin today is above yesterday's high. So that's where if anything recovers yesterday's high, the short side is invalidated. The longs are maybe back and it was a little bit of a a bear trap over there. Okay, next one we need to discuss hyperlquid. Let's go on to hyperlquid. Hyperlid starting to break down more aggressively as well. We're already hit take profit zone one that we spoke about at 23. I then said 1956 and then after that 1724 and we may as well quickly look at the other per dexes. Um, Astera continuing to break down over here. Not looking good. And then we got Lighter still following its journey down for 70% move from high to low. At least 70%. I guess 60% is also something to consider. 60 to 70% would take it to about 129. Then we'll look for this to to maybe slow down a little bit. The next one to look at is XRP, right? XRP looking really really weak here. And the reason that I say that, you had the fake out over there for one candle, rejection off of that trend line over there. So faked out above, rejected, still failing at the mid-range. But now you're breaking back below this range. And I I spoke about this one before. I said that I think that it's very easy for something like XRP to full retrace into this zone over here. So we're going to add a new price label for XRP, and we'll call that Destiny as well. And we'll change it into pink. Um, and why do we lose the wording then? Let's just Okay, we have to put it again. Let's find Destiny. There we go. In pink over there. So, XRP could very, very, very easily lead to full-on distribution. You've had so many tests into this level. I personally think XRP looks incredibly bearish over here. And similar to Bitcoin, you could just be placing a stop loss underneath or excuse me, a stop loss on a short trade just above yesterday's high. And um we should see we should soon see follow through towards the downside over here. There will be multiple takeprofits along the way. You got these clusters of support coming in over here at about 145. Another one at about just above a dollar and then ultimately down to 62 cents uh is what I'd be looking at full retraces. Okay. So there's a lot of work a lot of work from the bulls that needs to be done. These are the main things I'm looking at. if you want a great place to take these trades. By the way, guys, anyone that's new over here, you get a $50 immediate sign up bonus over there. $50 immediately if you sign up on uh Bybit, and you can get up to $30,000 on a sliding scale depending on how much you deposit into that account. So, $50 is guaranteed up to 30,000 depending on what you deposit. And then of course they have staking options as well for anyone that wants to you know you just want to hold um USDT and and and wait for uh the bare market lows which we'll see we'll see when that comes into play. So I think if in a worst case scenario for the bulls price comes down to 56k probably puts in a massive bounce over there and then maybe you you le it down one more time but there is going to be bidded zones along the way right areas that we need to buy. So, yes, going to be brutal for the XRP fans. Again, no disrespect to anyone. You know, it's it's your money. Do whatever you want with it. I'm simply just outlining what looks factual to me on the charts and backing it up with, you know, at least um a prior track record. I would hope a prior track record. So, let's quickly see what the votes are, how things shifted over here. Almost a thousand of you have voted and we got 36% of you. is starting to skew a little bit where some of you don't even believe we're going to get the bounce over here. I think it's going to be very dependent on what the stock market does. Uh we can have a look at a bunch of the other coins. So I know some of you are throwing out requests there. Avac, Salana, things like that. So you know we can have a look over here. Um I still think Salana down to about um $100 region 100 110 Sui you have to consider this right once this breaks this is going to be acceleration down. So, you got that little bit of trend support, but we spoke about this taking out Tuesday the 13th of January's candle um low, which was the expansive candle that got a lot of bulls uh hoped up and and all giddy for higher prices. As soon as you took that out, you knew there was trouble coming. Uh we have already Sonic going into price discovery to the downside. Say new lows. I I warned of all of this, right? I already warned of all of this. Cardano, brutal, absolutely wrecked. It's probably still going lower like 24 cents. Avac is going lower. It's going to make new lows as well. You'll probably eventually take out that wick low which was the 10th of October mass liquidation event. Uh Ton also probably new lows. Casper probably coming in for new lows. You'll find intram support over here bouncing off of this trend line at some point. Tron, you guys know the story. XPL just brutal straight down. Pumpf fun actually one of the stronger ones that are trying to hold up over here. There's just um you know no confidence in taking any of these altcoin trades. Ono I had a previous target. I'm just going to move it slightly up to the right side. Uh ages ages ago we said that on we think will come down into this circle over here which is let's give it the midpoint at about 21. Okay. Um what else? What else? What else do we have? So those are the main things. Those are the main things that I was looking at over there. Um can you still take the platinum trade? The the time was yesterday. I I did say it multiple times. We can have a look at the platinum trade. Um let's quickly see over here. Maybe I'll drop onto a low time frame. So platinum, it's it's a little bit difficult. Look, if you were to take this trade, you're going to have to execute on a lower time frame and just hope that these are higher highs and higher lows forming. Therefore, trail your stop loss underneath the higher low. So I wouldn't take it over here. Personally, I don't know. It's it's what is your upside potential? That's what you have to consider. If this plays out in full 25%, I guess it's pretty decent. But I mean, I was happy to take it where I took it. I It's hard to answer that question for you. I think if you saw a flush down like this, if you got something like this on platinum again, that gives you another opportunity for re-entry. That's probably the best place. For me, this feels a bit too risky to take it over here. I would rather wait for more structure to form. Something like that. A little bit more structure to form on the hourlys. So, I probably wouldn't take it. Okay. Pippen is up or piping up. I don't know. I'm assuming you're talking about Pippen. It is up a little bit today, but uh just like everything else, a little bit of a bounce. Uh we still in profit, right? It's in the money over there. Okay. Uh what else? What else? Has silver peaked? Uh difficult to say. I don't think so. Not yet. But it will soon. I think it will soon. So, it's clearly in a parabolic uptrend over there and at some point you're going to put in a major top. That's why you got to trail those stop losses over there. Um, all righty. So, also another thing, guys, that I can recommend is if you do want to reduce the amount of exposure or risk that you're taking on in the markets, one of the easiest and best ways that you can do that is of course with um gaining funding, right? So, you can use the link in the description below for Bitfunded. A lot of traders are withdrawing massive profits. I just wanted to show you on Apex, for example, risking $1,000 to pass the challenge can gain you access to $150,000 worth of equity to trade with. That's big. If you know what you're doing and you know how to calculate your risk-to-reward, remember, there's an amazing calculator. I personally believe it's the best in the whole industry because I made it. Um, it's over here. It's on the website. You can go long, you can go short. You can know exactly what you're going to risk for each trade before even entering that trade. Um therefore you predetermine what your downside would be and your losses and having a funded account further um decreases your risk because the max you can lose is you blow the challenge and you'll lose $1,99. And if you want a smaller challenge, well you they go down as far as only $79 to get access to $5,000. So everyone that's been through the trading journey knows and understands this. eventually get to this point where you transition away from trading with your own cash and capital to rather utilizing someone else's money. So for any of you that want that, it is linked as well in the description below is bit funded over there. Righty, quick look at the comments. S&P6900 long. I don't know about that. Let's have a look at it. Uh I can't imagine if everything else is going to go down that this is a good idea. It is coming into key support, but um there's just no signs of strength over here. This is this is just price discovery almost to the downside. You do have lower lows from back in March 2025. I wouldn't be bullish on this. So many tests into this level. I think this is going to accelerate back down towards these lows. It's brutal. Very very very brutal. Okay. Um thoughts on render? I'm pretty sure I looked at this today and it was it was bad. Uh rejection off of what was previous support, right? Previous support flip now into resistance. It's probably going to come back down for these lows. Uh $1.19. Okay, $1.19 is a possibility over there. So, there is money to be made. You need to be on the right side of the trade. You need to be taking the short trades that we've been given. Uh and we you need to be taking the commodity longs that we've also given. So, that's it from me. I'll see you guys on the next one. Take advantage of Bitfunded as well if you guys want to get access to other capital. I'll see all of you on the next one. Have a good day and cheers for now.",
