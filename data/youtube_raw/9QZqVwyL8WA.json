There's a reason why Bitcoin's price is exploding. It's due to a massive global liquidity shift. There's a reason why altcoins are up 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70% today. Less than 24 hours to go before the Clarity Act Senate markup. We do have a big update about this. Most people have no idea how quickly this is all happening. We will explain everything to you today in 9 minutes or less. My name is Aaron at Altcoin Daily.

Bitcoin's price is exploding because of a massive global liquidity shift. We knew this was coming. It is now here. This is confirmed by Mara CEO. Mara is probably the largest Bitcoin mining company in America. Their CEO, Fred Teal, brother of Peter Teal, explains what's happening. Bitcoin and Ether, in all fairness, outperforming the market year to date. Bitcoin up right around 8% year-to- date. You say this is part of a shift due to how the world is just viewing monetary risk and geopolitics. What is the shift that's taking place and why do you think Bitcoin's benefiting? Well, Bitcoin benefits really from global liquidity primarily. So if you think about markets right now, you have US government increasing liquidity. Interest rates have come down. You have other comp other countries also increasing liquidity. And Bitcoin operates in two particular worlds. The developed world and the developing world. In the developing world, Bitcoin is really a hedge against the decrease in value of local currencies. You can see what's happened in countries like Iran, Turkey, Venezuela, other countries like that where their currencies have been debased and it's a great way for people to hold value um against that debasement. In the US and the developed world, it's more of a store of value and you've seen now banks come into the market. You've seen tradi institutions really come into the market and adopt it. And so it becomes much more affected by global liquidity because it's treated more as an investment asset and an asset that trades sometimes like equities, sometimes like gold, but really is driven primarily by global equity global liquidity. >> So as we know, certain altcoins are already being singled out for the Clarity Act. This is actually quite bullish. We updated you on this in yesterday's video. For a full analysis on why certain altcoins are more greater affected than others, make sure you check out this video. I'll link it. So, the markup is scheduled for January 15th, tomorrow. We have a big update. US Congressman French Hill surprised a lot of people by coming out and saying he's looking forward to the crypto market structure bill passing. He says it's a good week in crypto. Listen to his update and you give me your thoughts below. Yeah, we've got uh it's a good week in uh crypto in the sense that Senator Tim Scott is having a markup this coming Thursday tomorrow on the uh crypto legislation that we sent to the Senate last July. This is the market structure. This is the rules of the road for dealers, individuals on how they will use digital assets and what the fitforpurpose regulatory structure would be. So, I'm really looking forward to that debate in the Senate tomorrow, and I hope this means that we're moving closer towards having a law that President Trump can sign, which is one of his commitments to have both a stable coin bill signed into law and a market structure bill. >> And in addition, let me give you more updates on the crypto market structure bill draft markup. Props to Eleanor Tourett, who is a cryptojournalist covering this extensively. She says new with less than 24 hours to go before the markup, tensions are high and fatigue is clearly setting in. One senator's comments described to me by somebody present at this morning's bipartisan member meeting to discuss the amendments summed up the mood. Quote, I can't wait to never have to hear the word crypto again. So, it sounds like they're really talking about it. So, you know that the bill markup is tomorrow. This is just something that has to happen before it can get voted on and hopefully passed into law. But there is more to know on the process. Quick recap here. Crypto market structure legislation requires action from two Senate committees. Banking, which oversees the SEC and securities, and agriculture, which oversees the CFTC and commodities. Because of their separate jurisdictions, each committee drafts its own bill text and marks it up independently. Once both committees finish, the texts are merged and the full Senate votes on the combined legislation. Senate Agricultures markup is the one that has been pushed to the end of the month. The Senate banking one is tomorrow. Note, the same procedure occurred last summer in the House with House Agriculture and House Financial Services following a similar process. And with all of this going on, this was actually surprising to me. This guy's big on Wall Street, big on CNBC as an analyst. He usually doesn't cover crypto or talk about it. It's not his thing. So, him admitting this kind of a big deal. CNBC analyst says Bitcoin and crypto is the next big trend for 2026. I've said it before, it looks in the near- term like Bitcoin's probably developing into the strongest nearterm trend with momentum. Listen, >> I said before it looks in the near term like Bitcoin's probably developing into the strongest near-term trend, but are we seeing signs of of a rally that wants to to slow down and stall or we just simply seeing some growing pains as we see this broadening? >> I think we're seeing the consequence of elevated volatility and it's been that way since the beginning of the year. You use the word momentum. Momentum is trying to find what will be the next trend establishing itself. Um, interestingly enough, it looks like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is where that next trend ultimately is going to be. >> Guys, there is a mini altcoin season going on right now. This is actually good to see. It's It's good when speculation and risk appetite comes back into the markets. So, we need the market structure bill to pass in my opinion to see higher highs this year. We need the Fed to start cutting and getting us into an easing cycle. And there is a looming government shutdown again at the end of this month. We need to get past this. So if things go similarly to how we think they're going to go this year, there really is a lot of room to run for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Salana, quality altcoins. Again, I don't think people realize how quickly this is all happening. >> Do you expect this is where financial services are is going? Are are the major banks and the brokers out there today moving increasingly toward tokenization? >> Oh, absolutely. And it's the uh the way the world will be uh you know here in the I mean maybe not even in 10 years maybe even a lot less time maybe a couple years from now. So I think that all of this modernization of the markets I think is good. We're actually embracing it and I believe that we need to be embracing it to keep the United States at the forefront as far as cryptocurrencies and whatnot. There were really only two countries in the world here in the last few years that were working to make cryptocurrencies illegal and that was communist China and the US through the SEC. So that's changed. It's a new day now and so uh we want to embrace uh this new technology. >> Thank you. so much for 2 million on Axe. Again, thank you everybody.
