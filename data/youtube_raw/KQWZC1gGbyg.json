  "transcript": "Crypto has got $275 billion in tokens that \nare going to hit the market by 2030. There is   nowhere near enough demand to absorb it. This \nisn't a prediction. This is locked into smart   contracts right now. And in this video, I'm going \nto show you the math that explains why alts keep   bleeding. This video is for information and \nentertainment only. It reflects my personal   opinions and is not financial advice. Check \nthe description for more information. Always   do your own research. Hey guys, I'm Alessandro. \nWelcome back to the show. Here is something people   don't realize about the stock market. In December \n2023, something changed. For the first time ever,   passive funds overtook active funds in total \nassets. This is across stocks, bonds, you know,   everything. This means there are more price \ninsensitive buyers than price sensitive buyers.   They don't care if it's the market top. They don't \ncare if the market is up or down. The money just   flows in regardless. 401k retirement accounts \nhold $9.3 trillion. And every payday, a slice of   that goes straight into index funds, straight into \nstocks, regardless of price. Total US retirement   assets are at $45 trillion now, 62% of all \nequities. Vanguard's VOO, which is Vanguard's S&P,   did $116 billion last year. That is more than \nevery Bitcoin ETF combined since they launched.   And then when you add corporate buybacks, \nover $1 trillion was bought back in 2025,   which was an all-time record. It was also enormous \nthe year before as in 2024 about $800 billion in   buybacks happened then too. The other thing about \nstocks is that businesses are the best vehicles   humans have ever created for turning money into \nmore money. They generate earnings and on top of   that there is always an underlying bid. Bitcoin \nhas that too. Saylor's buying every single dip   regardless of price. Corporate treasuries are \ncopying him as well. Again, price insensitive   buyers. They're not trading. They're just \naccumulating. Doesn't matter what the price is,   they're buying regardless. Since January 2024, \nBitcoin ETFs have pulled in about $56 billion   in net new money. It is the most successful \nETF launch in history. And Michael Saylor's   MicroStrategy and the corporate treasuries \ncopying have also hoovered up an enormous amount   of supply. MicroStrategy bought another $2 billion \nin Bitcoin just last week. On the supply side, the   miners produce about 450 Bitcoin per day. About \n$14.6 billion per year in new supply hits the   market. ETF demand regularly exceeds miner supply. \nThere was one day where ETFs bought 8.2K BTC,   about 18 times what the miners produced that day. \nVery clearly, demand is greater than supply. And   that's why Bitcoin dominance has gone from 38% in \n2021 to 59% today because capital is rotating into   the one major crypto asset that has structural \ndemand that absorbs the new supply. And this is   where it gets pretty ugly for alts. Alts don't \nhave demand absorbing supply. They've got the   complete opposite. Way more supply than demand. \nI went through every major alt and calculated how   much new supply is locked in vesting schedules, \nthe tokens that will hit the market no matter   what. And the number by 2030 is $225 billion. This \nis just in unlocks. We've got staking inflation as   well. Every proof of stake chain is constantly \nprinting new tokens. These tokens are used to   pay the validators on the network. Solana inflates \nat roughly 5% a year. Avalanche is roughly 7%. ETH   is, you know, 2 or 3% and this adds another $51 \nbillion in new supply over the next four years.   By 2030, then $275 billion is going to be hitting \nthe market. So that math is already locked in. It   is in the smart contracts. It is in the vesting \nschedules. It is happening regardless. The vast   majority of those unlocks happen sooner rather \nthan later. The 2021 VC vintage are hitting their   four-year cliffs as well. The recent tokens that \nwere launched in 2024 and 2025 like Hyperliquid   for example again also coming into their initial \ncliff unlocks. 2025, 2026 and 2027 are where the   most amount of unlocks have been positioned and we \nsaw how much damage that did in 2025. The average   alt last year is down 79%. But wait, you might \nsay, what about the ETFs? Aren't they bringing in   billions as well? The thing is it's not helping. \nTotal crypto ETF inflows, all of them combined,   Bitcoin, ETH, Solana, XRP, $71 billion in 2 \nyears. And now the alt market has $70 billion   in new supply hitting every single year. The most \nsuccessful ETF launch in history, Bitcoin, 2 years   of inflows, is less than what the alt market needs \nto absorb in a single year. Even if every dollar   that went into the Bitcoin ETFs had gone into alts \ninstead, essentially it wouldn't be enough to hold   up current prices. Before we continue, guys, \nI just want to quickly tell you about today's   sponsor, Uphold. Uphold is a long-running digital \nasset platform offering access to crypto, stables,   traditional assets like commodities, all in one \nplace. They've been operating for over a decade.   They support a broad range of assets and put \na strong focus on transparency and operational   disclosures, including publishing reserves and \nbalance dates that many platforms still do not.   One of the practical frictions in crypto is moving \nvalue from on-chain assets into everyday spending.   Uphold offer a payment card that allows supported \nbalances to be spent directly. Super convenient.   Crypto is extremely volatile and unforgiving. \nYou can lose all your money. There is no safety   net. No one will come and protect you from bad \ndecisions. Only get involved if you understand   the risks. Thanks to Uphold for sponsoring this \nvideo. Stablecoins are crypto's killer app,   right? The one thing that's undeniably working. \nSo successful that Congress right now is actively   debating regulation. This is crypto's breakthrough \napplication. It is like the adoption story. The   stablecoin market in the last two years has grown \nabout $150 billion. Call it $75 billion a year.   Alt unlocks are about $70 billion per year. So \nstablecoin growth is just beating the rate that   the alt market is trying to exit. Think about \nthat. The biggest breakthrough application in   crypto is only just beating the current supply \nside issues that alts have got. When you think   about that, it is crazy. Even if all of the \nstablecoin growth went directly into alts,   essentially it would be a one for one for \nabsorbing supply. Now that's not actually   how markets work. If you injected $75 billion into \na $600 billion asset class, then yes, it goes up   by much more than just the one-to-one. But this \nis very clearly a supply demand side discrepancy.   But you might say, okay, now what if I just \npick good projects, real revenue, real users,   that should work. And that is essentially the \nonly thing you can do. But even that is not enough   to overcome poor tokenomics. Look at Jupiter, \nright? Jupiter is one of the most successful DeFi   projects ever. They've got avenues in basically \nevery successful DeFi vertical there is. They're   the biggest aggregator on Solana. They've got \na perpetuals market. They've got a borrow lend   market. They even did $70 million in buybacks. \nAnd the token is down 89% because revenue doesn't   save you from tokenomics. Total crypto buybacks \nacross all projects was about $1.4 billion last   year and total unlocks about $97 billion. So \nbuybacks are absorbing about 1.4% of unlock   pressure. Even doing everything right doesn't \nprotect you when the supply maths is broken. Now   here is where we have to flip the script slightly \nbecause this isn't a crypto is dead video at all.   Stocks work because businesses are the best \nvehicle for turning money into more money. That   is their fundamental reason to exist. Crypto is \ndoing the exact same thing and it does it faster   and more efficiently than traditional businesses. \nLook at this chart. It shows how fast companies   hit $100 million in revenue. Hyperliquid was \n89 days. pump.fun 121 days. Axiom 117 days. The   companies that make it the fastest are in crypto. \nFor comparison, OpenAI took 1,825 days to make   that much money. Crypto businesses scale rapidly. \nBusinesses that exist on-chain are very clearly   able to scale faster for whatever reason that is. \nAnd this is where it gets even crazier. Look at   revenue per employee. Hyperliquid generated over \n$800 million in 2025 with less than 15 employees,   about $75 million per employee. Tether is very \nfrequently given the most efficient company in   the world status. Hyperliquid arguably is \nmore efficient, but regardless, Tether,   again, massively efficient company, makes loads \nof money, hasn't got many employees. Apple $2.5   million per employee. Meta $2 million per \nemployee. Google $2 million per employee.   The numbers just don't even remotely make sense. \nOn-chain businesses aren't just fast. They're the   most capital and labor efficient businesses \never built. Perpetual futures are one of the   breakthrough applications for retail being able to \ntake on leverage. Stablecoins are an application   that are essentially going to proliferate across \nthe entire globe and already are. Say what you   want about memecoins, but having some token tied \nto brand equity is a real thing. Goodwill exists   on balance sheets. There is a world in which \nmemecoins are essentially goodwill tokenized.   These are verticals with real product market fit. \nThey're generating real revenues. Yes, memes are   not. They have tiny teams. The problem isn't that \ncrypto is fake. It's that the tokenomics often   kill the projects. The tokenomics are regularly \nbroken and they just struggle drowning in unlocks,   especially as the market gets dead, especially as \nthe hype leaves the market, which is what's going   on right now. The actual industry is healthy. It's \njust most tokens are not. ARK Invest just released   their report for 2026. There are entire sections \ndedicated to blockchain and blockchain innovation.   You've only really got to look at how the adoption \nof Bitcoin ETFs have been to understand that this   truly is something that the financial system is \ngoing to be running on in the future. Blockchain   will be the backbone of financial rails in the \nfuture. It's just that right now valuations are   way ahead of the revenues they're making for \nmost tokens. And the supply side dynamics, i.e.   the amount of tokens that still need to hit the \nmarket without enough demand are still going to   be a big issue. And so when does it end? Well, the \n2021 VC vintage, which was enormously high FDVs,   that hasn't really stopped when you look at recent \nlaunches, is still ongoing. Most new tokens have   4-year vesting cycles, if not longer. So, until we \nchurn through the vast majority of those tokens,   2021 tokens are coming into the end of their life \ncycle. But all the ones that were released in   2023, 2024 are mid cycle for enormous supply side \npressure. As I said at the start, we're going to   see $275 billion hit the market by 2030. At the \nmoment, the worst years for unlocks were 2025,   2026 is also going to be a tough year. And 2027, \nthese are where the peak pain is going to be. But   once we churn through these, some of these tokens \nhave a real chance of actually surviving. And the   ones that should survive are the ones with real \nrevenue, real users, real reasons to have existed,   the ones that are mostly done unlocking. They'll \nemerge into a cleaner market. It is by no means   the end of crypto. It is just like awkward years \nthat have to be gotten through so that the supply   can actively get into the market. Stocks go \nthrough massive corrections despite being the   best money-making machines on Earth. Bitcoin can \ndrop 50% even with a continual structured bid.   Alts can pump even with broken tokenomics. We've \ndefinitely seen it happen. There is no guarantee.   There are only probabilities. But here is the \nthing. On the whole, assets that go up over   time share certain qualities. Demand that absorbs \nand ideally exceeds new supply. Real businesses   turning money into more money. Investing in the \nproduct and producing better revenues as a result.   Also price insensitive buyers that accumulate \nregardless of sentiment. Most alts have none.   $275 billion is coming. $70 billion in unlocks \nper year including staking rewards. The most   successful ETF launch in history doesn't even come \nclose to one year of alt supply side pressure. The   math is the math. But crypto is building real \nbusinesses. Hyperliquid, pump.fun, Tether,   these are among the most efficient companies \non the planet. It is very likely winners will   emerge along these lines. Guys, just one more \nthing. If you don't have a hardware wallet,   you need one. You can't be in crypto without a \nhardware wallet. Everything we just talked about,   the volatility, the uncertainty, the last thing \nyou want is to lose your crypto to a hack or   an exchange going down. Ledger is the industry \nstandard. Keeping your keys offline keeps your   crypto safe. There is a link in the description. \nGo check them out if you haven't got a hardware   wallet. Don't let someone stealing your tokens be \nthe thing that makes you get a wallet. Trust me,   it really hurts. Guys, thank you so much for \nwatching. I shall see you in the next one.",
