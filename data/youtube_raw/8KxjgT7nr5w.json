  "transcript": "Crappy Christmas. Bitcoin fails to capitalize on a decline in inflation as OGs continue selling and ETF outflows persist. Behind the headlines, we explain why the two macro announcements of last week failed to move markets. Token, [music] how a recent crypto acquisition has thrown up some uncomfortable truths [music] about tokens and what they stand for. And we'll have the tweets of the week, Lewis with the TA, an update on our portfolio competition, and much more besides. This is the Coin Bureau News Live. Ho ho ho. Good to see you one and all. Apologies for starting the stream a little late today. Uh Nick was so excited about Christmas and Bitcoin crossing 90K again uh that we had to sedate him slightly. So, he may be a bit dopey in this. >> I even got you a gift guy, but we'll reveal it at the end of the stream. Yes. Yes. >> Should I I feel I should probably be worried. I I I can't see how this is going to turn out well for me. It's great to see you guys. The final Coin Bureau live news show before Christmas. And as you can see, we are very much in the spirit of it. Uh thanks for joining. It's great to see you. Uh the market is is pumping a little bit. >> Santa rally came late, but it's coming. Hopefully, he can hold it up that momentum. >> Maybe. So, my name is Guy. I am joined by Nick. Uh he is, as I said, very excited about Christmas. Uh, we are looking forward to giving giving you the lowdown on everything that's been going on in crypto over the last week. Before we start though, you need to hit that like button. You see the progress bar underneath. Nick, if we get to a,000 likes, I'm not going to I'm not going to sugarcoat this, folks. Give us a,000 likes or Christmas is canceled. I'm going to get center on the blower and I'm going to say if we don't get 1,000 likes, just don't bother coming. >> We'll give them a Christmas wish. Maybe a Christmas wish for the new year if they get if we can get to a thousand likes. >> Okay. So, I'm stick your carrot. >> Stick. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Well, yeah. All right. Well, you can have a Christmas wish from Nick, but uh just just let just know that if we don't get 1,000 likes, I'm canceling Christmas. So, um shall we uh any other housekeeping before we kick off, Nick? >> Oh, yes. Don't forget to stay till the end, guys, because [clears throat] we still got the last two weeks of that giveaway for the portfolio, which is I think still about 5,000 close to $5,000 back to break even [laughter] given Q4. >> Close to $5,000 >> before the fact that we close to $5,000 only been slightly down. That's an achievement. So well done there. You beat the market. Yeah. Uh so we'll be taking a look at the portfolio at the end. That's the portfolio giveaway. So stay around for that guys. >> Okay. All right. Let's crack on. It was a Was it an interesting week in Bitcoin? >> It was slightly. Yeah, slightly. I mean, so we opened up last week if you recall, as I'm always going to say on a Monday. It was a big CME gap day. There we go. Congratulations. You played yourself. Don't ever trade Bitcoin on the Sunday evening. >> Uh so we had that open up on Sunday. um into Monday. Uh Sailor on Monday again bought another billion a yard of Bitcoin. >> Oh, second week in second week again for the second week. >> Yeah. Yeah. Didn't do much to the price though. Um as we can see from I think we've got a chart of it. Yeah. Didn't do much at all. Um so, uh that's just where we are, folks. Even Sailor can't move it these days. Um and in fact, on Tuesday, after that brief euphoria around Sailor being a Chad, we were back into extreme fear mode. There we are. 11. Turn it all the way up to 11. >> I mean, to be honest, I don't think extreme fear really encapsulates what's going on in the timeline today. It's more like extreme fear implies they was given a [ __ ] in the beginning. [laughter] Extreme extreme apathy. Let's not let's not. Um, >> we did have NFP numbers though. These were delayed NFP numbers. So, they were for uh the previous month and they came in actually above expectations, which was good. Although the unemployment rate did tick up. So, it was a bit of a mixed bag there. >> Okay. Then Wednesday, uh, we shot up and closed that CME gap and as soon as we did, bang, it was back down again. >> Yeah, man. That's just the market makers playing games with us, right? >> Thursday. Um, now something is making all-time highs. Well, for one, uh, silver, can you believe it? Silver is making all-time highs and it overtook Google by market cap, asset cap. Uh, it's up 160% something this year. And the Bitcoin gold ratio is at its lowest level in almost two years. >> So Max Payne, was Peter Schiff been right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Then we had CPI numbers. Now this was a bit of a surprise, but this was a surprise to the upside. Um it was three. It was expected 3.1. It actually came in 2.7. >> Yeah. And core was al also cooler than expected. Um, again did not much for the price, >> but we we'll talk about that in a bit, which is surprising given that it was a massive undercut in terms of like what they're expecting, but we'll get to why it didn't move the markets in a bit. >> Yeah. Then on Friday, we had the much uh anticipated and uh fludded Bitco BJ rate hike which came in as expected. But you know, and the markets actually rallied uh and crypto Twitter was kind of like in a tizzy about this the week prior basically how this is going to destroy the markets and we're going to take us down to bare market territory. But uh no, it actually rallied and we'll also be explaining why in a bit. Um then over the weekend uh well the week Thursday to Friday we still had ETF outflows and this is actually the first week out of in about a month that we've had outflows about $952 million of outflows. >> Okay. And uh yeah I mean it kind of this summed up the whole week really. It was uh it's been it's been one of those ones. It's just it's just one to forget, isn't it? >> Yeah. Well, where's the where's the chart? >> Do we have a do we have a chart for that next bit? >> Technical issue. >> Oh, you have technical gremlins. It's Christmas. Um, okay. So, um, but we also opened up another CME gap. Um, that was today. >> Exactly. And, uh, yeah, it closed immediately. Okay. Well, there we go. This, this is basically that's last week's chart. No, the past month's price chart action. And this is a very technical technical anal analysis term called the B uh, the BFR, the BART Fibonacci ratio. [laughter] Increasingly smaller market makes scam wicks. They take you out of your positions and liquidate you. I mean this is just crazy price action. Now you wonder what what happens on October 10th. All the market makers got you know rinsed. >> Uh so yeah you come back to the CME gap. Uh the CME gap did open up just this morning and it closed within an hour. So bish bash bosch. >> Okay. >> Now we're back above 90k. >> Yeah. Yeah. Let's see if we can hold it. I think I think basically everyone wants it to kick on to 100k for Christmas. >> That's the dream. >> Let's hope so. >> It's still it's still got a few days. Uh meanwhile in terms of what's coming up um we we've got uh some interesting movements on the daily chart. >> Yeah. So just quickly to put this into context we basically managed to hold above the 100week moving average which is a good support. We've got no CME gaps and we're on the edge. We above 90K. Now if we keep up the momentum three key levels to watch. Uh first one is the 50-day moving average which is at 92.7K. Then it's 93.4K which is where we opened up the year. >> Really? Yes. >> Okay. >> So, we can not be down this year if we just managed to [laughter] please. What a what a benchmark. We basically ended this year off. But like, can we not be down? [laughter] >> I mean, we'd take it, wouldn't we? We take being down. >> I would take not being down, bro. Um, not can't say much for als.k levels, there's 61.8% Fibonacci level from the rally um pre of the lows to the highs, which is a 94.3. So, three key levels to watch. >> Okay. Meanwhile, you've been tweeting about options markets as well, right? Basically, um the options market look is quite bullish. We've got a big options expiry on Friday, Boxing Day. Uh and this $ 24 billion are expiring. The options markets are slightly more bullish given that we've got 2.6 times more bullish calls than puts. And also the max pain point is at 96K. So if you believe the theory that options writers try to pin price to this level, that's where you know the markets could trend to in the spot markets to try and inflict the max pain on option buyers. >> Okay. Um meanwhile there's the onchain picture isn't isn't quite as rosy though. We are still seeing OGs are still selling um and it looks like demand is still slowing. >> Yeah. So exactly on the onchain side, it's still not looking good from from the this mass distribution we've seen from the OG's and there's not that much demand stepping in. >> Okay. >> But um yeah, if you guys want to trade these markets, uh if you trade want to trade this little Santa rally we've got going towards the the end of the year, then we couldn't think of a better place to do it than on Tubbit. Now Tubbit's our first uh brand partner. They're in top tier international exchange. Uh they have an amazing interface, deep liquidity and competitive fees. Onboarding is incredibly simple. All you need is an email address and you can sign up and check it out and see how it works to you. And then if you do want to use it, you can um uh basically avail yourself of 90k trading rewards. Um 90k 90k USD and then also VIP level one upgrade which which gets you 50% off trading fees for life. Uh and um yeah, like I say, it just requires an email to sign up with that's all. And um yeah, go and trade over on Tubbit and make use of those bonuses and offers. >> Nice. Nice. Okay. Uh I'll give you a quick rundown of uh what sentiment is like. God, you can only you can't be one minute late, Nick, because they pick it up. Will they be late again this week? We don't want to develop a reputation for tardiness. >> We we never When was the [laughter] last time we were late? We're like virtually never late. >> If we're if we're one minute if it's five, if it's 1 minute past, then we're late. >> This is the problem when you create expectations of being incredibly punctual. >> We should just We should just be habitually late. >> There's literally other guys out there who stream like 10, 15, 20 minutes late to basically build up the the momentum. Disgraceful. Disgraceful. Um Brett is uh Oh, Brett's giving me crap about the cricket. Not Not today, Brett. Not today. It's It's too raw. Um Diamond 5027. I'm mentally exhausted. We're all mentally exhausted. I'm with you. I'm with you. Um >> so true. >> Uh although not uh Orb 360, who's quite the opposite. You know, sentiment is bad when this chat is being flooded and I can actually follow along. I love fear. I love it. I'm buying all your damn tears. Wow. That's That's the spirit. >> That's the spirit behind there. Okay. >> Yeah. He follows that up. Mentally exhausted. WTF? You guys are weak AF. [laughter] >> Oh, I love it. >> Okay. Well, I'm glad someone I'm glad someone's got on the eggnog early. Um, fantastic. Okay. So, uh, shall we talk about these two? Basically, I think a lot of people were expecting the market to move to do more last week and it didn't. Even though we had these big bits of news related to inflation and the Bank of Japan. So, should we break down what went on? >> Yeah, exactly. You know that meme with Bitcoin? It's like, come on, do something. Come on, do come on. Uh, this is kind of like the expectations versus reality of the CPI/BOJ, what happened last year. Uh, so on the CPI side, firstly, let's put break it down. So, it came out much, like we said, much cooler than expected. uh 2.7% yearonear versus 3.1% and then the core numbers were also much lower. Uh but um part of the reason why this seems to have not been that much of an impact and not just in crypto markets but also in trad the the government shutdown and the this of course disrupted the Bureau of Labor Statistics data collection process. >> Yeah. So uh yes so the the upshot was October data couldn't really be gathered. November figures were computed. They use some sort of carry forward estimates and incomplete samples. So basically confidence in data is in certainly US government data is pretty low at the moment. >> Yeah, exactly. Uh and e economists and even the Fed were warning that the CPI print could be skewed by by the missing data and of course holiday discount effects and all that. >> And actually Fed officials were were explicitly noting these distortions and they said that recent data should be treated with caution. So that's that's kind of where we are at the moment. Although we are getting important data that we need that data is even you know even the likes of the Fed are coming out and saying that data is not necessarily reliable. >> Yeah. [snorts] Exactly. >> And I mean that just kind of sews the sort of uncertainty that markets really really don't like. >> Yeah. So we're going to have to wait for the next CPI release to get a better picture on inflation or the PCE numbers which is of course the Fed's preferred number. Um, so that was the CPI, but the one that had created the most anticipation, at least everyone on the crypto markets was, uh, the BOJ. Uh, and you can see some of the Twitter arty out there basically with the FUD posts about how badly this will crash Bitcoin. Uh, given that it happened in the past to a degree, but then there's also the case that it didn't really because there were other factors that caused prices to crash, not just the BOJ increasing rates. And even the trady media was actually concerned, you know. Yeah. >> Why you should be worried. Yeah. However, the actual reaction to it was fairly muted. And you know, props to you, Nick. You did kind of you did highlight this in a previous in in the last week's stream, didn't you? And then on Twitter. >> Yeah. I mean, look, to be honest, that we mentioned in the stream. And when when the market's pricing in a 98% probability uh of a rate hike, then I mean obviously it's priced in like they're going to wait to be confirmed of 98% probability. And also there was the fact that there was no also what was said within the meeting. there was no forward guidance given um and so in terms of like where we could see future interest rates going in in Japan. So this left them wondering so it didn't necessarily um there was no surprises within the meeting. >> Okay. Okay. So but again like you know with a with a lack of forward guidance it's again it's uncertainty. >> Exactly. >> Um and I guess the broader concern is what all of this means for heavily indebted countries. Of course, Japan itself is is right up there in terms of debt, but >> Japanese tenure rates are now at levels not seen since even before 2008. It's crazy. And it's Yeah, it's the I think it's the most indebted country. I think it's only one other country, some African country, but it's the most indebted, one of the most indebted countries in the world with 210% GD debt to GDP. And now rates are rising and they, you know, sovereign concerns are a big thing now in Japan. Yeah, I'm always a bit surprised how Japan just seems to manage to keep ticking along when you consider kind of all the things that are facing it. It's like the most indebted country. It's aging faster than basically any other country. Like they've already got like large parts of Japan basically just emptying out. They sell more adult nappies than they do children's nappies. >> No way. Seriously? >> In Japan? Yeah. >> Wow. That's an actual system. >> That is an actual fact. >> And they're also in one of the kind of more spicy regions of the world. You know, there's quite a lot of there's, you know, quite a lot of tension in that area. They're not far from North Korea. They're not far from China, Taiwan, you know, and yet Japan just sort of just seems to keep on going, >> you know. It's that Japanese eth stoic nation. Very stoic nation even after remember like being bombed twice by two nuclear bombs and having to come out of that, you know. I mean to have that pretty resilient. They're pretty resilient. So >> yeah. So maybe maybe they'll get through it. But yeah, basically uh that is why um so I think we've outlined the reasons there why we didn't get sort of much I mean it was a difficult market last week. I wouldn't have wanted to try and trade last week. >> I wouldn't have. Yeah. Yeah. >> All seemed very counter to any uh any signals that were being given out. Um so if you're thinking gosh I don't want to do anything with my crypto right now. I just want to keep it nice and safe in my wallet. Then the best place to do that is in a tandem wallet. Um, and you can get a extra 15% off or buy one tangent wallet set and get 50% off until the 2nd um from the 2nd till the 22nd of December. >> Today. Yeah. The last time the last time you can do it, guys. Take advantage of it ASAP. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. So, scan the QR code. Tandemss are lovely devices. Really easy to use, really easy to set up, and they sit in that nice little niche between a hardware device and a very functional web wallet as well. Highly recommend. Yeah. So the other big piece of news last week uh and this relates to altcoins specifically the f >> the future rights of altcoin holders and more specifically one altcoin where the holders got really shafted. >> Yes. >> And this was the news that circle had acquired and signed a deal to acquire the tee technology behind Axel's developer company which is interoper interop labs. >> Yeah. So Axelr is a sort of crosschain communication protocol. It's been around for quite a long time. We actually covered it for our coin bureau club members quite a while ago. A legit project, a a useful a useful infrastructure project. So this wasn't, you know, and this was, I guess, the reason why Circle wanted to uh wanted to make this acquisition. However, as Nick says, the deal did not um buy the Axelr network, the Axel Foundation or the token itself. They were explicitly left out of the deal. they are going to continue under community governance and open source stewardship via another development group. So, you know, it's not to say that Axel itself has been rugged or wound up or anything like that, but the fact is that Circle has basically come in and I guess >> taken the golden goods. >> Yeah. I mean, you could say they've kind of asset stripped them in a way. >> Yeah. And investors didn't take well to this and a AXL's price tanked. And I I got you got to feel sorry for the AXL token holders, right? because there was rumors about this or talk about this acquisition for weeks prior and they must have bought in anticipation. Well, I'm going to go and I'm going to buy some AXL. I'm going to make a big gain when it when it doesn't when it's announced. >> I mean, you couldn't blame for that. Like you can't Yeah, you can't blame them, right? Because you would expect that if you if the Interop Labs or whatever, you know, these negotiations going on. Yeah. >> And then you buy the token in in anticipation and then uh it comes, the news comes out and you're like, why is the price tanking? >> Yeah. >> I didn't read the fine print. >> Yeah. Now, it wasn't actually um wasn't the only deal of this kind. Coinbase also acquired uh Vector recently as well. Um but that uh that did not include the Tensor token. Yeah, exactly. [clears throat] uh that was attached to the Vector project. So the big question that this has raised is what this means for token holders because as we've seen particularly with AXL holders as Nick said this is the sort of news that you would have expected once upon a time to pump a token and instead this has had the opposite effect. And I guess what this underlines first and foremost and this is really important to remember because I think this is something that people lose sight of a lot. Tokens are not shares in the company that issue them. No, they aren't. I mean, in fact, token holders and projects have gone to great lengths to try and claim we are not securities. We are not securities. So, tokens mean this means because it's not a share, you do not legally have a claim to profits. You do not legally have a share in an intellectual property or in this case in any M&A payouts. >> Yeah. And I guess I mean I guess the huge irony at the at the heart of this is that for so long the idea that the SEC under Gary Gendler you know wanted to categorize tokens, you know, most tokens out there as securities and there was so much push back from the industry because this you know this was not what we wanted. But ironically if they had been made securities then those are the you know we'd have got token holders would have got much more of those sorts of guarantees. that that that would perhaps have protected investors. >> Yeah. Uh and and this is it. I mean, obviously the timeline was incredibly salty about there's a lot of interesting takes there which you can kind of to a degree understand. Uh and because token holders they bought with the implicit with the assumption they were going to share in the growth of the network and they were going to share in the success of this project. Um but then Hib also came out with from Dragonfly. Hassib Keshi came out and he basically laid out and they were also investors in Axel and I actually did an interview with Tom Schmidt from Dragonfly last week which is coming out this week and he also talked about it. they were investors so they they lost money. But he makes a good point here to the extent that >> the team was okay look if you if you're a project and you're running out of runway and you're going towards a brick wall and you're not you're going to basically go out of go out of business and a a company comes and they're going to make an acquisition offer to just you and the dev shop of it right do and they don't want to take the token. What are you going to say? Are you going to just continue working until the end until you fail and have no runway? Are you going to how you going to raise any more money? are the token holders going to give money and legally like we say the token holders don't have the legal rights and that's not the project's fault it's just the fact that that is the the way that the industry structured it right so if you don't have legal rights to it >> do you you and and you're a company and and circle people are taking shots at circle right >> but circle's main objective main fiduciary duty as a publicly listed company is for their shareholders yeah and the maximum value for their shareholders >> yeah I mean circle circle are running a business like everyone else they that there is no obligation on them either you know in a fiduciary manner or even a you know in a kind of moral manner I guess to to make token holders of a particular project that they want to acquire they don't have any responsibility to them in part because you know being a token holder does not give you as you said it does not give you any of those legal rights >> but then again it's also you know the token holders there's a concept okay caveat emptor buyer beware you buy in the token you have to understand you don't have these legal rights but then you can also make the argument like these token holders were early supporters. They've been there for a long time. Uh should they be left out in the cold with with a with a shell of a company and it's it's a difficult one because it's like at the end of the day legally they'd have no rights to it, right? And if you're an early stage investor, if you invest in as as VCs would in like early stage projects, you run the risk that something will fail, right? And uh in this particular case, it's they they found the legal the circle went in there legally and bought a a company and decided to leave out the tokens. >> So token holders are obviously very upset and they they should be to a degree, but at the end of the day, it's you these are the things you sign up for when you buy a token on a in a project that doesn't have legal rights to the the project itself. Yeah, I think there's I think there are kind of two thoughts that that spring to mind most readily for me here in that one we're still very early in terms of in terms of this journey into crypto becoming if you like a proper asset class a grown-up asset class and this is kind of why we do need regulation. You know, a lot of people a lot of people are of the opinion and they might have a point that regulation is is already taking taking something away from the industry, but unfortunately in order to in order for investors in crypto projects in the future to have, you know, more protection from things like this, that is that can only really be solved with regulation. So, that's my first thought on this. You know, we we are still very early, unfortunately, in the regulatory journey for crypto, and it's one that is going to have to be made to avoid stuff like this. I think also as well, we probably should prepare ourselves for kind of more things like this happening. I mean, let's face it, Axel is a is a solid project. It had a solid team and they were, you know, they were trying to do something useful. It wasn't, you know, it wasn't one of these, it wasn't vaporware. So, but if a project like that is running out of runway and needs to take the needs to take the what must have been a pretty tough decision, you know, to be acquired, but not, you know, not uh not for the benefit of token holders. How many other projects how many other legit projects as well as ones that aren't so legit are sitting out there waiting to be waiting to be acquired? I mean, I kind of think this might be a feature of 2026 if we're if we're really heading into a bare market. >> Yeah, exactly. And I guess it comes back to the question if what does this mean for people thinking about the investment case for tokens? If you're going to be an asset allocator, capital allocator, an institution or whatnot, and you see this, you think, okay, if I'm buying a token in a project, I'd rather have shares in a company, right? If I'm going to this is the legal risk I run. Um, but yeah, I mean, we'll have to see what comes out. We got clarity. Hopefully, we get some clarity on clarity act uh next year, early next year. That's the big thing. people are focused on the regulatory com component but yeah I mean it's um let us know you guys let us know down below what you think about this but we'll come back to it at the end on the comments >> this now of course brings us to the bitget competition which I mentioned at the beginning now for those who are joining for the first time who don't know what this is uh it's a quarterly competition we do giveaway trading competition giveaway where we started the quarter with a $5,000 portfolio >> and it's currently about near that again um and the mo here is that every single week we ask our viewers to choose a coin and an alo and a size to allocate that portfolio to. Uh every single week we do that and then we come back the next week and close it and and do it again and rinse repeat. Uh and in order to part and then at the end of the quarter and at the end of this month uh we give away the portfolio to one of our viewers. Now, in order to participate, there's only three things you need to do is one is you need to have a BitGate account. And if you don't have a BitGate account, scan that QR code or hit the link down in the description. Not only can you participate in this competition, but you can also get up to $50,000 in trading incentives and sign up bonuses, uh, and then trading fee discounts as well. So, that's the one thing you got to sign up to the BitKit account, watch the stream, which I assume you're doing anyway right now, and then vote on the trades. Um, and that then, of course, brings us now to our vote for this week for one of the four coins. So, guy, let's take that away. What are the coins today? >> Okay, so today uh we're going with the two regular choices. So, um you can elect to go back into BTC, you can elect to stay in USDT or our other two choices. Now, these are kind of hot right now, not necessarily for positive reasons. First up, Uni. Um so, UniS swap is currently uh their vote, their fee switch vote ends on Christmas Day. >> Yeah. >> Um so, we're putting Uni in the poll now. And also Arve. Now, Ave, a blue chip battle tested DeFi project as well. Been around since forever. Um, but is currently there's a bit of a battle going on at Ave, isn't there? Between the foundation and the Dow. >> Yeah. Yeah, I believe so. >> Yeah. So, Ave is kind of in the news for the wrong reasons at the moment. Um, so we thought we'd throw that into the poll as well. So, your options again are Bitcoin, USDT, UNI, or Ave. Vote now. >> Yeah, vote now. The poll is up in the comments. Okay. >> So, we're going to uh we're going to go over for some TA with Lewis now and then we'll come back and you'll be able to vote on how much of the portfolio you'd like to add to whichever coin wins the vote. But in the meantime, Lewis, the floor is yours, sir. [music] All right, guys. So, honestly, nothing much has changed on my end. I'm still waiting for more clarity in the markets to decide what to do. Obviously, we've been in a downtrend for the past few months and until we see something change. I want to focus more on preserving my capital than I do trying to hit a trade that most likely won't even happen. And so, for the few things that I am looking at, yes, we saw that Bitcoin did go back above its trend line resistance, but you can see here Ethereum still is not above its trend line resistance. So, that makes me a bit more cautious. And yes, we did see the bare flag form on Bitcoin and Ethereum and some alts and then it ended up breaking down. So typically, yeah, there's some type of retest and then a move down. But the thing is now on a lot of alts, liquidity is pretty thin. So it's not going to take much for just one entity to come in and either push it up or push it down quite substantially. And that's why I'm typically trying to stay out of these markets right now and just wait for some type of really good setup. And I'll look at coins like Salana for instance and I'll see it's just literally down to the right down to the right down to the right down and it broke down below here now. And yeah, like typically this would actually be really bullish. And so if someone does want to put a trade on for this type of play where you could say that this is a reclaim of the lows, right? That would normally be really good and perhaps this is going to work out. But um if you look back here, you can see that this is really where the lows are. So, let's make it green right there. And uh so, personally, I would rather wait to see if it comes down here instead of trying to front run in a downtrending market. Or I would just wait until something, you know, pumps up and then I would just look to short it instead because at least I'd be going with the trend in that case. Also, if I'm going to be trading alts, what I'll do is I'll look at alts against Bitcoin. So, this is like Salana against Bitcoin. And obviously, if it's down here, that would be a great buying opportunity, right? Or if it hits this big trend line support, that might also be a good buying opportunity. But since it's still basically in the middle, I'm not like too fond of buying it right now. And then what I'll do is I'll just go through all of these different coins like Hype and Suie and Dogecoin. And what I see is that they're still pretty far away from the lows of their wicks that happened on October 10th. And I think that probably somewhere more closer to the lows of the wicks is where we will see a huge huge huge bounce. Yeah, we might get one, you know, before then because like I said, the liquidity is pretty thin. So, anything could really happen. But I would just say to be on the safer side, it's probably better to, you know, wait until either we have more liquidity coming into the markets, we're back in an uptrend, or we reach some level that is just so undoubtedly in a good value zone that you might as well just buy it and hold it. And if you're really itching to trade, I would try to find the outliers like XMR or Monero, for example. It's all the way back at its previous all-time highs. So there are definitely coins that are pumping. And then we have ZEC, which of course went up over a,000%. So this one has the liquidity. It has the volatility that people want when they're actually trading. But uh these ones are far and few in between right now. And so for the most part, I'm still going to be waiting, just holding what I already have, not really doing much, unless of course I see something like Zcash that was in a clear uptrend and then came back down to a key support area of interest, and then I'd want to get in, you know, right here. But most coins aren't really like this right now. However, you could always find them if you go digging deep enough. So, fingers crossed that we do get that Sansa rally that everyone wants and is hoping for. But just from a technical perspective, I don't happen to see anything super super bullish right now that I could actually trade. Of course, if I do see a trade setup next week, then you guys will be the first to know. With that, I'll hand it back off to you guys at the studio. >> Okay. Lewis is Lewis is is is taking it easy for Christmas. >> Still on his hands. Yeah, exactly. Don't need to make a trade, man. Enjoy. Touch Okay. But uh we are going to make a trade here. So um we should now have uh the votes finished on what we're going to buy. So can you guys reveal what we're going to buy this week? >> Bitcoin. >> You guys are so conservative. >> Bitcoin max is in the chat. Yeah. I mean, okay, fine. >> Well, I mean, at least they didn't vote. At least they haven't voted to buy USDT for weeks on [laughter] >> I mean, so Bitcoin it is. Uh we're now going to open a poll. What percentage of the portfolio should we allocate to BTC? 25,50 75 or full port DAP mofo. Let us know. Take a vote now. And uh whilst you're doing that, we will have a look at some of the tweets of the week. >> Let's put it up. First tweet. >> Have we got >> Where's the >> No, we've got Lewis back. >> Back. Cheers. Lewis can't get [laughter] >> Okay. Where's the Where's our Where's our transition, guys? >> Okay. >> Oh, no transition. Okay, cool. Okay, so this first one is from Flood ThinkingUSD. The best thing exchanges could do is delist all but 100 tokens. Make it competitive to stay listed on the exchange and stop dividing the melting ice cube of retail capital across thousands of worthless assets. >> Spicy take. >> That is a spicy take. Discuss. I mean, I I I've got to say like I mean I can't see exchanges doing this because that's that's a huge amount of trading fees that they would do. >> Yeah. would have to mean they'd have to make a decision in the better in the for the betterment of the space and not profits which I don't know is that something you think that they would do? >> Yeah, I it would be hard to do objectively because uh you know what but how do you decide how do you decide which token is more useless than all the others, you know? >> Well, I mean top 100 okay but like I mean not even top 100 because there's a lot of garbage in the top 100 >> that's been exist that's existed in the top 100 for quite some time. Yeah. >> Um how do you how do you decide that? I I have to say I would back this. This would have my support if exchange wanted to do this. Yeah, I'd maybe maybe they could open a vote. Maybe they could have a poll. We could all vote. >> To be honest, also the question is okay, what about the projects? But to if you look at some of the projects that have got listed on top tier exchanges for the first day listings, they have not performed well. They have not. So the whole concept and notion that you need to be on a centralized exchange for your token to succeed, I don't know. That could potentially be called into question. I mean, look at Hyperlid, right? I mean there's many different factors there are dexes dex infrastructure strong enough to be listed on a centralized exchange to succeed as a project some would say you do some would say no it's not needed and and in fact the liquidity is basically exchanges can tank your token and there's been a many of that so it's an interesting discussion >> yeah and some good comments on this yeah all exchanges would have to do it yeah that's right and you know exchanges it's a pretty cutthroat business that so it would be hard to enforce but I don't know I for one would be would be in favor. All right. Next up, we have this one from uh Blanc XPTt. >> There he is. Eric Trump. Q4 is going to be unbelievable for crypto. Yes. Well, he was he was right in a way, wasn't it? >> It was entirely unbelievable and unforgettable. It was the worst Q4 in seven years. >> Unbelievably effing terrible. [laughter] >> Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Eric. See See you in 2026. >> Speaking of Trumps, I found this tweet from many years ago. Okay, don't have the date yet. I think this guys, this was from September 29th, 2011. >> Could you have imagined that these words been uttered by Trump? [laughter] >> Well, people are allowed to change their opinions. >> This is true. It's quite some time. The Fed's reckless policies of low interest rates and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> It's I mean that was back when back when he was on Twitter. I suppose that's that's an artifact in itself. >> Isn't he still or just on truth social now? But I think other people repost his truths >> on on Twitter. Now X gosh, we've come a long way. Okay. And uh we also have this one from Spectre Analyst. Um oh my word. Yeah. $50 million to address poisoning. >> Yeah. So for guys who don't for those who don't know what an address poisoning scam is, it's literally um a scammer just spamming an address with a fake with a fake address or spamming a transaction on your address with a fake address. That's the rece recipient that looks like a an address you know or have sent to in the past in the hope that you're going to copy the spammed address >> thinking that it's the same address when in m you're actually copying the scammer's address. So literally what happened here was someone sent $50 million which they copy pasted the wrong address. Now there's many this there's so many questions I have here but I mean it is it's crazy man. I mean, it kind of makes me think that if they did that, then $50 million is probably pocket change for them. >> Probably not much. >> But I mean, this this raises a good point, folks, and this is something to remember because this is, you know, if they had $50 million in crypto, it suggests they've probably been around for a while. >> Never copy and paste a send address from your from your previous transactions. You should always go to the source itself, copy and paste from there and then double check it, triple check it because as Nick said, the the spammers are very good. The the scammers are very good. They can change the they can change the address so it looks very very similar to the one you're wanting to send to. They only need to change, you know, a few characters and they know that most people check the first few digits and the and the last few, but it's in the middle where the change will be. So, you can't be too careful. I mean, you know, even if you're sending $50, let alone [laughter] $50 million. >> But he also was he did send a 50 to he sent a $50 transaction, a test transaction, and then the spam just immediately after that, the scammer obviously can can identify the address. They can see, wow, this guy's got 50 million in this address. Let me try my luck. Sends a spam transaction >> and but you still should still have gone to the blockchain explorer, triple check, gone to an Excel spreadsheet. I do like when I do these transactions, I go like not these number sizes, but when I do these transactions like equals to check that the address is equal and in Excel to make sure it's true or not because it can never be too too sec and then send it in more than one go, guys. Don't have to send them all in full port everything in one transaction. >> I mean, um, but anyways, hopefully he's able to recover it. It's it's quite uh it's quite a sad quite sad episode here. >> Yeah. just shows folks you can never be complacent, never uh never compromise when it comes to security. This unfortunately is the sort of downside of permissionless finance. There ain't no help desk. >> Yeah. No, for sure. >> Um one uh one transaction. >> You can't speak to the blockchain manager. You can't speak to the blockchain manager. You can't call up Karen can't call the blockchain manager. [laughter] I'd like to reverse the transaction, please. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um someone's actually quite a lot of people saying in the comments, someone's saying, uh I sent uh five bucks to a mate this morning and they tried. No amount of money is too little for him. Yeah, you can't be too careful, folks. You can't be too careful. >> Okay. Um gosh, that's a that's a sobering sobering tweet to end on, isn't it? So, let's cheer ourselves up with some dates for the diary, folks. So, what's happening tomorrow, Nick? >> Tomorrow, there's delayed GDP data. This is for Q3. 3.2% is forecast and 3.8% is previous. >> Okay. Then on Thursday, it's the 25th of December. This is a big day for all crypto investors, folks, because this is the day where you need to find a dark corner somewhere in your house and stay there for the whole of the day because you know that the there's Mr. Investor. How are your little coins doing there? You know it's coming. >> And there's grandpa sitting at the table and he's going to brag about how his silver investment is up 160%. And how's your your coins, your magic inter money doing? >> I [laughter] put $500 in silver 25 years ago and now I'm a millionaire. Oh, granddad. Yeah. So, um, uh, yeah, unfortunately, folks, I mean, last Christmas, it was it was pretty good, wasn't it? >> Last Christmas, your crow in there basically like, you know, shut up, grandpa. Don't tell me about your your digital your coins and everything. I've got Bitcoin. I hold Bitcoin. Trump's going to be the best most pro crypto president there is. 2025 is going to be the year. >> Yeah. Unfortunately, your cryp your crypto skeptic uncle is just as good at keeping receipts as you are. So, uh, yeah, find a nice corner, folks. I wish I wish we could be bringing you better crypto vibes for Christmas, but unfortunately, it's not it's not going to be like that. Now, before we sign off, uh, let's see the results of the poll. So, we're going into Bitcoin. How much are we going into Bitcoin, folks? >> Full port into Bitcoin again. Okay. Uh, right. Let me share my screen. We will get this done. >> The last uh maybe the last trade before Christmas. So, um, am I up on the screen there? Let's add it to the stage. So, we are going, uh, we've got BTC, we've got a market by, and we're turning that slider up to 100. Confirming. Done. The jingle. The jingle of destiny. Okay, folks. So, um, do you want should we bring up some comments? >> Let's do that. Just a few comments before, >> um, so, uh, everybody. Yes, good point here. Everybody chasing easy money is in silver right now. >> It's true. >> Silver's the trade. >> I actually had a long open on silver uh up until last week. I closed it a bit earlier than I would have liked, but that's that's one of the few trades that's gone right for me in my life. >> Look out JP Morgan guy over here is trading silver. There we go. >> I've discovered I've discovered precious metal ps. [laughter] Get ready. Get ready, Wall Street. I'm coming for you. Um, and this is a nice uh nice one from Basement Basement Racer.

So, um, well, we should uh we should wish all our loyal viewers a very happy Christmas. >> Happy Christmas, guys. And yeah, now this is the brings us to the end of the stream. And of course, it's the season of gift giving as and I thought about you and I got you a gift. I don't know if you got me a gift. >> Uh, yes. It's just in uh my car. [laughter] >> But I know I know this is a very important gift for you guy and I had I had to search far and wide for it because it's not easy to find people who have your particular tastes especially when it comes to socks. >> Ah, okay. Socks. >> Pink pair of socks. I know you love pink socks. >> Fantastic. I do love I love socks and I love pink socks. >> Hot pink socks. There we go.

So, Christmas is not cancelled, folks. I'm not going to call Santa. Instead, I'm going to put these socks on and have a wonderful time. Nick, that's very generous of me. Thank you. >> My pleasure. Hopefully, Karma will be good. Maybe you'll remember me next next year. [laughter] bit passive aggressive, but we'll take it. Yes.
