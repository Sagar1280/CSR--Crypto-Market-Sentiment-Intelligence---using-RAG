  "transcript": "What's up, guys? It's Jordan here from Coinb Trading. Just a quick update on the Bitcoin technical price charts. Happy New Year. Welcome to 2026. I hope this year will be prosperous for all of us in this community. If you're new to the channel, subscribe and let's get into it. Be sure to take advantage of our week's campaign using this QR code. Remember that nothing I say is financial advice and it's only my opinions. If your opinions are different, this is really good as this is what makes us stronger as a community. The first thing we can clearly see is our New Year's pump that broke us out of our symmetrical triangle with a perfect breakout and retest. From the start of the 1st of Jan, we received a really nice 8.24% pump up to that 94,832. If you need a better understanding of how to trade these symmetrical triangles, there is a full tutorial on my personal trading channel, so check it out. The link to my channel is in the description of this video. And here it really shows how profitable it is to be diligent when you notice these patterns to make sure that you are entering longs from the support and shorts from the resistance. There is a really nice way to hedge trade these kinds of patterns and it shows that if you're able to hold your longs and your shorts with nice stops on either side, you are able to hold your positions through the breakout for really nice price targets. I did recently drop a video on the hedge trading strategy and you can apply that same strategy to patterns like this. That video is on the Coin Bureau trading channel under my playlist. So, check it out. The next thing for us to always be aware of is the fixed range volume profile on our current range. Price action has been rinsing and repeating. And if you were diligent enough to take the last long from the value area low, you would have now reached your final take-profit at the value area high. And price is already moving back into the fair value gap, which is the gap between our value area high of the range and our POC. This is your fair value gap. And currently price is moving away from the value area high back down towards our point of control. Please make sure you watch the hedge trading strategy video to understand what you need to look for in order to make sure you can milk these kinds of ranges for the ultimate amounts of profit. Also very useful when using the fixed range volume profile is to draw in your horizontal support and resistance levels at your high volume nodes. Just look for where your volume sticks out the most on your volume profile and go and drop horizontal lines at those levels. When you see two levels sticking out to a similar point, you can also go in and draw a rectangle there for a high volume zone. And these are heavy zones of support and resistance that need to be broken. We can clearly see here just how heavy the resistance was at this level with multiple massive rejection wicks. Then we see with the New Year's pump that enough volume came in for price to be able to break through that zone. And now we have actually retested it. Now it is a matter of whether Bitcoin will come back up into value area high to test the top of this range to possibly leave this entire range behind or whether we will receive the rejection with enough volume to break us back below this high volume zone down towards our PC at 87,500. Very important for everybody to take note of is our new campaign with weeks. And really, it is very easy. Weeks is making it super easy for us. For the first $50 futures trading bonus, all you have to do is deposit $100 and trade a $10,000 volume. A $10,000 volume might seem like a lot, but actually it's really easy to achieve by using leverage. You can then also see that you can earn another $80 trading bonus simply by depositing $500 and reaching a $20,000 volume. This also then goes up for those traders who have access to higher margin to deposit $1,000, reach $100,000 in volume, and receive a $100 trading bonus. If you are a futures trader hitting higher volumes, you can see here that if you hit a $10 million volume, you can claim a $1,000 USDT bonus right up to a $12,000 in total if you manage to climb the ranks of all of these volume levels. It's also always important to note the fixed range volume profile of the larger range that we are currently in. Remember, it's always good to zoom out to give yourself more perspective. If we drop in the fixed range volume profile on our larger range with all information included, we can see that we are actually bouncing from our value area low up towards the point of control of this larger range. We have front run this point of control now three times. And this is the magnet on our chart to the upside that is calling for price. Once we reach this point of control, this will be the major indication of whether we are moving up towards value area high of this larger range and potential all-time highs or whether we are coming back down again to test the value area low of this larger range and possibly much lower levels. You can also go in and mark your high volume nodes in this larger range to really show you where the largest points of support and resistance are. Once we do this, we can clearly see that above us our largest resistance is of course 94,500 96,400 at our PC and below price of course the high volume zone that we identified between 90 and 91,000 and then below us are 87,000 and 84,000 levels. If we break those levels, we can also look towards the 79K level, the 76K level, and the 68K level, giving us a very large high volume node. Luckily, things are looking relatively bullish right now. So, at the moment, we don't need to worry about those much lower levels. If we look at our market cipher indicator on this daily time frame, we are seeing a lot of very nice information. If you haven't yet watched my market cipher strategy tutorials on the coin bureau trading channel, please do watch them to get up to date with our info so that you can trade along with us. Market cipher has printed a red dot trigger wave on the wave trend on this daily time frame. We are also seeing that VWAP is now crossing to the downside and money flow is looking like it is pointing in a downwards direction. This does signal to us that there might very well be more price action to the downside on the short term on this time frame. So, let's watch this high volume zone to see if it gets broken again or if it holds us up. If you've watched the hedge trading strategy tutorial, you'll know that we only take this red dot trigger wave if it is printed while price is still above our value area high. So, right now I am not taking this short, but I'm waiting for more signs on the chart for the next good trade. And this might come on lower time frames. Remember to never let FOMO drive your entry signals as you do not want to hop on a moving train or you will land on the tracks. If we head down to the 4hour time frame, we can see that the market cipher trigger wave strategy played out absolutely perfectly by giving us a red dot trigger wave while we were above value area high with our VWAP crossing and with money flow pointing down. And this trade has played out really really nicely to the downside with at least a 3% drop. If we then have a look at our daily RSI, we can see that the relative strength index has broken out of its resistance that it was facing at this 50 line and now has received a rejection but not within the overbought territory. This again could mean some more short-term retracement but potentially higher levels here to bring the momentum into the overbought. If we look at our RSI on the weekly time frame, we can see what looks like a trend reversal in momentum. Back to the daily time frame, if we clean up our chart and pull up our moving average cross of the 50 over the 200, we can also see that our faster moving average is starting to turn around and is now pointing horizontally to the right. This is a good sign as it is the start of a potential trend reversal signal and we want to see this 50-day moving average turn around and start pointing up towards that 200day moving average to hopefully eventually give us that golden cross signal. So, keep your eyes on the angle of this 50-day moving average to see if it does start to turn up or if it continues down on its bearish",
