I'm just going to make sure that everything is looking good and >> make sure that everything is good. >> Sounding good. What's going on, guys? I appreciate you. Uh, I'm here with my shorts opened as well. So, >> what's going on, guys? I appreciate you. Uh, here >> I'm just setting some things up. This is my first stream. Uh so appreciate everyone who is >> actually watching right now. Let me share my trading view. >> Alrighty. Share this right here. See how this looks. right here. >> Is it coming up any day now? Give me one second here. All right. Oh, there you go. I need to add this to the stage. >> There we go. >> What's going on? How do you pronounce your name? Dumbit true Kimoas 5229. >> Yeah, I'm gonna I I got to make it make it bigger. That's what she said. Okay, let me uh go over here. >> And let me do this real quickly. Solo layout. Boom. Boom. That's me. Hello. Ah, I need I wish the focus was more in place, but I'm going to be in the corner anyway, so it's not going to be that big of a deal. All right, I need to make this a bit bigger. So, I think that this will be probably the best one for me. So, let me try that. Boom. Oh, there you go. Hey, this was Mr. Whatever. This was pre-planned. Okay, I've been actually meaning to do this for a little while. Um, I just haven't had the time until right now. But unfortunately, I think for a lot of people, um, it's not going to be all sunshine and rainbows. It's not going to be like necessarily what everyone wants to hear because I'm typically very I'm very very risk averse. Okay. So I am someone who basically I heard that that the that to be a trader the definition of a trader is technically it's a risk manager right it's someone who manages the risk and that's what I learned a long time ago and that's how I trade I trade by trying to manage my risk as much as humanly possible which is not like most people right as in crypto in at least most people in crypto So, you know, they'll go all in or they'll throw a huge percentage of their portfolio into um Yeah, thank you. Thank you, man. Uh before Trump invades Greenland. Yo. Okay, this is like I mentioned before, this is my first stream here on the Coin Barrow trading channel, and I I like I'm liking this. This is cool because um you guys are you guys are funny. I almost cursed. I'm going to try not to curse. I don't think that's good for YouTube, right? But um let's It was It was for all of us. Oh, I see. I see what you're saying. Maybe I could go over here. I could put BTC on the charts. Yeah. Okay. So, you know, you basically nailed it. I'm I am I am a bit of a bear. Um not always. Okay, I'm not always a bear. I'm just sort of a bear right now because of where we are in the in the market cycle. Okay, I just think that we're at a place in the market cycle that warrants to be more cautious. Okay, to be a little bit more Welcome TP live streaming. Oh. Oh, to live streaming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Hopefully I could uh do a lot more live streams. Um, I'm not sure anyone really knows uh too much about me right here from the Coin Bureau channel. So, just as a little bit of introduction, I am now on also the main channel as another host. In case you watch the main channel, you've seen me before. And I've made some videos on Coin Bureau Finance as well. And before I became a host on Coin Bureau, I've been actively trading these markets, crypto markets for the past almost eight years now. And uh I appreciate that discovering Florida. I'm also I'm from Florida, okay? If let me know where you guys are from because I want to know who actually is watching this during these market conditions, you know? Um cuz everyone watches everyone watches, you know, crypto when it's going up and it's at new all-time highs, right? But you guys are the real deal. You guys are basically crypto connoisseurs. The fact that you're watching it from here, I mean, and and and we're down off the highs and a lot of the uh altcoins are basically dead at this point or or down tremendously at this point, right? Um Romania is dope. I really want to go to Romania. Um, but anyway, let me get back to it. I was France. I've heard I've heard some some things about France. I don't uh good and bad. How how is it? How is it? Very ver is that how you pronounce it? Ver. Um, but yeah. So, I'm now a presenter on Coin Bureau on the main channel. Before that, I've been a trader for almost eight years in these markets. I've basically just been living um off of trading for uh since 2021 essentially. It was my bearishness that came in very handy in 2021 uh because I was able to actually sell the top of the cycle and basically just like take that money and invest it which was awesome. And now uh I've I've been trying to refine my strategies. I've been trying to well not trying to I've been refining my strategies. I've been I've been thinking more about the markets and trying to figure out how to how to trade crypto and the best ways to trade crypto. And the thing is this is a trading channel. So, I know a lot of people are going to be watching and they're going to be going in and out and they're going to be scalping and they're they want to know like they'll look at something like this and they'll be like, \"Oh, hey, this is a hu this is such a huge move, right?\" Um, but like to me this this really isn't such a huge move, you know? Like to me the big moves are 30 40 50% 60% more, right? Those are big moves. 5% moves, 10% moves. I'm not really necessarily looking for for those type of plays. I'm looking for the big picture, super high probability trade setups. That's what I like to look for and then go into them and then just chill out and just wait, right? Because it's so much easier. And if you could time it right, which I know that's saying a lot, that's asking a lot, but if you could time it a lot, uh, time it correctly, you could literally just like buy in to certain cryptos, chill out, wait, go do your own thing, make money from your business or from your job, and then come back and just compound your wealth that way. And so I went from doing the trading like every single day, trying to trade every single day to trying to find these bigger picture things. And so that's my style. That's how I like to do it. And that's basically the uh mindset and the and the frame of reference that I'm going to be having on these streams and and when I trade. So just to let everyone know that's that's the case. Um, now let me I need to plug something in really quickly. Give me one second here. I need to make sure that this goes in here. Uh, all right. Of course, of course, of course, of course. My mouse is requiring some batteries right now. So, let me throw this in here. We like your macro videos. Good job. I appreciate that. Thank you. We're all professional hecklers on this channel. No, you guys, for the most part, are pretty nice. I got to say, I've been I've been heckled pretty bad before. And you guys have been cool. I've got to dig dig my car out of thick snow tomorrow. Sorry about that. Uh, Canada, Toronto. That's pretty dope. Hopefully. All right, let me throw this in here. All right. Now, I got my mouse actually actually charged up and uh where where is it? You ever you're ever on your um lose your lose the little cursor on your computer and you're like you have to like squiggle the uh trackpad back and forth a million times in order to actually find it. That's what I'm doing right now. Okay. Found it. Found it. Sweet. All right. So essentially um I just explained my my type of viewpoint on the market, my trading style, stuff like that. And I just wanted to get started with this. Please stop silver, dude. There's no stopping silver. There's no there's no stopping silver. Um they have silver on me. What the uh Sorry, I need to go over here and so so here's silver. Um, absolutely, absolutely rocking it at 77. This is a perfect example of of of how I trade. A lot of people will look at this and they will say, \"Silver is on an absolute run. It's going higher and higher and higher. I need to get in because I'm going to miss the boat.\" I do not think like that. I think, \"Oh my god, look at how high silver has gone. Let me look at the past. What's happened whenever it's gone on these major runs like right here? Oh my god, it fell back down and crashed super super hard. How about last time before that? Same thing. It crashed super super hard. Even though that was in 1980, right? And this was in uh 2011. So what's probably going to happen? It's probably going to do the same and crash really hard. However, I will say that I think because of the global circum circumstances right now, um it I I think silver is going past the hundo. I think silver is going to go past 100, but I think that it's going to uh I I think that eventually it's going to crash down. Like just literally looking back at how I just did, right? Like think of it like being right here, you know, back in back in 2010. like it climbed up so so high from $7 and from basically like eight bucks to 30 bucks, right? And then you you're like, \"Oh, it's up so high. I don't want to get in. I don't want to get in.\" Um but then of everyone else climbs in and then they end up making money as well because then it goes all the way up to 50. But then it crashes all the way back down. So I think I think it still has room to run, but how much more room to run? uh you know maybe like 30 35% or something uh no not not from there uh maybe like you know yeah 30% let's just say 30%. Yeah, but I think within the next, you know, year or year and a half, it's going to end up falling much much much further down, right? So, do you want to trade this? That's the that's the question. You could. And how I would do it is you can't really use these high time frame things. You can't really use these high time frames to trade because if you do, where would you get in, right? Where would you where would you get in that would give you a trade idea that would be invalidated at a particular point? And this is what I'm saying. I don't even need to draw out it because this is it. It's going straight up, right? It's going straight up. This is the weekly chart. And you could apply this to any chart. You could apply this to any any cryptocurrency, any stock, anything, right? This is technical analysis. You could It's going straight up. So, where do you want to buy it? Well, let's say you you buy it right now. Let's say you buy right now. Okay. Boom. This is the long position. This is uh the indicator. It's a long position indicator, right? So, this is where you are going to take your profit at the top of this green box. And this is where you will have your stop loss at the bottom of this red box. So, that means that once it reaches the top of the green box, you're going to pull out. You're going to take your profits. And if the price falls down to the bottom of this red box, which in this case is $60 uh.77 for this particular thing right now, then you're going to sell at a loss. Why do you why do you have a stop-loss, though? What's the purpose of a stop-loss? A stop-loss is to be put into place to show you where your trade idea is invalidated. Right? So, what would make sense here? I you could you could think in your head, okay, well, this is a weekly chart. Last week, this was the this was the low of last week. So, I'm going to get in right now and I'm going to put my stop loss, you know, right underneath the lows of last week because that makes sense to me. Not like I'm not saying that actually makes sense to me, but if that makes sense to you, then that makes sense to you. Maybe you trade on the weekly time frames or you've seen this setup before. So you could do that and then you could say, \"Oh, well, silver is going to keep on going up. It's keep on soaring because um of the silver that's in technology, right? So you could put this trade on and this would make sense. This could make sense. This is not really something that I would do um because I don't necessarily use the weekly charts, but um also I'm not a big trader of silver per se. I I just buy it, you know, at the big macro levels. like a few months ago um we were talking about silver and and like a couple people I know and and they were able to get in. So I just buy and hold it. I don't I don't try to trade it. Same with the S&P 500. I just try to like buy and hold it, right? Um but typically you need to go into a lower time frame uh in order to put on good trade setups that actually make sense, right? And so I'll go down into the daily time frame on this and I'll look at this and what up Jordan? And so, oh yeah, trailing stops as well. Trailing stops as well. Perfect. Uh, perfect thing. That's a little bit of an advanced topic though. Uh, so that's something that I'll have to get in get into later. But essentially, like I was talking about, you need to have uh stops in place just in case your thesis is wrong. And when something is just going parabolic like how silver is, you you need to think about where am I wrong? Because because you're most likely going to be wrong at one point and let's say you put this trade on and you buy it right now and you don't have a stop-loss and then it ends up just just turning around and just falling all the way back down the same the same way how it did in the past, right? the same way how it did all the way uh back here like what I showed you, right? And it fall it just falls all the way back down and just falls all the way back down. Like you're gonna lose a tremendous amount of money if you don't have a stop-loss in place, right? So that's why traders aka risk managers like what I talked about before always have stop losses, right? And the way that you figure out where to place your stop- losses that that literally just comes with time with putting in the reps of of putting on enough trades or um and or back testing and just testing and testing and testing and testing and figuring out like where is the best spot like where do you think the best spots is? And I appreciate that, bro. Um, and you also have to you also have to take into the big picture of where we are in the market cycle. So, actually, this is a good point. I'm going to bring this up right now. This is something I wanted to talk about of the uh on the on the stream earlier on the Coin Bureau channel, which I didn't get to talk about, but and it's also this is also why I'm unfortunately uh a little bit bearish right now. Let me go over here and let me share this tab over here. We got to look at this. Okay, this you've probably seen this before, right? The uh Wall Street cheat sheet, psychology of a market cycle chart. I want to know where do you think we are on this chart when it comes to crypto and let's say let's say Bitcoin and altcoins also because I'm just saying from my perspective from my perspective we're right about right about where complacency is. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't want to I don't want Oh, Dan's the man by the way. Dan Dan is the man from this is something this is something that I always have in the back of my head. Where are we in the market cycle? Because if we if we're anywhere over here, it's super super easy if we're in the optimism phase, if we're in the belief phase, if we're in the thrill phase, it's super easy to trade. And you're probably going to make bank and you can make mistakes and you could put on bad trades and you could um and basically all your trades are going to hit. Not all of them, but like a lot of them are going to hit, right? But if we're in this phase over here, uh complacency, anxiety, um it's pretty difficult to trade over there because exactly. Sorry, I'm reading I'm reading the uh I'm reading it. Uh so very important pivot right now. Yep. Complacency sounds right. Trump screwed that up and threw in the bin. Threw it in the bin. The reason why Trump didn't and no one will ever, you know, throw this in the bin or or mess this up is because this is based off of psychology, human psychology, right? This was around before this was around when the rice farmers first made the stock market, first made uh ticks, you know? Um it's not going anywhere. This is literally human psychology. It's not even based on um politics or or anything really. It's just it's just human psychology, right? So, it's been around since the moment of the beginning of time. It's going to be be here forever until we're all just I don't know cyborg machines and we're and we all have uh what's that thing that Elon Musk is making where he puts it in your brain and and you're like half, you know, half human, half half cyborg. Until that happens, we're going to be using the using the psychology of the market cycle chart and we're going to be um you know, using psychology in our trading. And that's a super super super important that uh that you have this in mind. And so this is like this is my first stream, right? And so I told you all how I think about things. And this is this is another really big concept. It's like where are we in the market cycle? This is what you have to keep in mind because it will make trading so much easier if you understand where we are. So, we have this right here. And if we go back to um let's say we go back to the to the Bitcoin chart or we go back to to Trading View and then we go to the Bitcoin chart, what else do I notice? What else have I seen? Well, if we go to the Bitcoin uh monthly chart and we look at the time frames, okay, then we could see that the that the fourth cycle high um if you were to say take the um take this first cycle like sorry uh high to high like top to top and then the cycle bottom to top or the having to the top. It's all right around where right around where we topped. It basically lines up with all of those things with the with the cycle bottom top to top from the cycle bottom having to top and from the cycle top uh top to top. Um so it basically lines up which makes me think that we're now in the bare market and and um why I'm more prone to be more cautious now, right? Because if we were if it was before the Bitcoin having then yeah I mean I'm I'm very very bullish and we have a great future. But now when I'm thinking about it I I got to be on the more cautious side for the next like at least like six months. However, I will say this doesn't mean this doesn't mean that um sorry I'm trying to read the I'm trying to read the comments also. Bot trading there there are bot trading. I do want to get into bot trading, uh, bot trades. But, um, the thing that I was saying was that was that because we're on the other side of what is potentially the fourth cycle high, I think a lot of people will be looking at this and a lot of people will be saying, okay, like I want to get out. I want to sell on moves up whether that's up that's at 97k 108k or 10 and you know let's new alltime highs even although I don't think we're going to meet I don't think we're going to have new alltime highs we totally could we totally could but trading and this is another big big concept trading is always a game of probabilities it's always a game of probabilities you're never going to be 100% right you're never going to be 100% wrong well I You might be 100% wrong if you're just that bad, but trading is just a game of probabilities. So, what you have to do is you have to take into account all of these different data points that all the different data points that you could find that make sense to you that you understand, put them together in a cohesive manner, and then create a thesis based off of all of these data points that you look at. What I look at, what I've looked at are the having cycles and the Bitcoin and Bitcoin from bottom to bottom, top to top, all this stuff. This is one thing that I looked at. The other thing that I looked at was what I showed you before, the psychology of a market cycle, you know, cheat sheet. This is the other thing that I looked at before. The other thing that I look at is ETF data. I look at the ETF data and I and I see, hey, look, um, we've been, you know, having negative ETF data for, you know, quite a while now. And when this turns around, then maybe that will be a good indicator that the big institutions are buying more Bitcoin again or buying more Ethereum again. And there's just a lot of um where I'm trying to find the be I'm trying to find the uh actual data on this right now. But essentially essentially what you have to do is you have to come up with your own analysis and own understanding of the market. And look I'm not I'm not perfect with it, right? I'm not perfect with it. But I did do this analysis. I did do this analysis like a year and a half ago of where the fourth cycle high should be and I I had it down on September um the last week of September and it was like it was it was a week off. So there are definitely different things that that you could do which give you like really good odds of um you know of of succeeding. And so the other thing the the other thing that I think is really really important when it comes to trading, okay, is number one, liquidity. Yes. Number two is to not get so not not get so caught up in what everyone is saying and and and and start freaking out over everything, right? Because a lot of people right now are are are screaming like, \"Oh my god, this is crazy. Bitcoin's up. The markets are pumping. You know, respect the pump. It's going to the moon.\" All this stuff. You hear it all the time, right? And you know what? We totally we could we could but but look at where Bitcoin is. 90 93,000, right? Let's say 93,600. Where was it? Where was it? December 11th, the same price. Where was it? Like like just of just last month, it was the same exact price. We're in like this is a range. Let me go let me go to my other Bitcoin chart. Just just explain this, right? Like like this essentially is a range from let's say 84,700. Let's say that's the bottom of the range. And let's say that this is the top where it bounced off of and had resistance like one, two, three times 90, let's say 94K. That's the range we've been in this we've been in this range since November. So, everyone's like freaking out or everyone's like like put so much emphasis on on these moves on so many moves, right? Like every time there's a move, you have so many people jumping out like, \"Oh, this is it. This is it.\" Alt season, this is it. Bitcoin season, this is it. You're sideline. Better be ready. All this stuff, right? And uh good. That's a good one. And and and we're we're literally in the range. We're literally in a range. So, just use o always always always bring yourself out and uh and and and take a step back and look at things from like the bigger picture, right? Otherwise, a lot of times you'll get FOMO and it's just it's it's not really going to work out in your favor as much. I'm going to read some of these. I'm going to read some of these comments right now. BTC revisits to 200 SMA. Let me let me see. Let me see. 200. I'm pretty sure I have the SMA on here. Yeah, it's I have it. Um where is it though? Oh, here it is. Yeah. So, 200. Uh that's around that's around a 100 right now. So yeah, it would be around 100 if it reaches the 200 SMA. Uh no no sorry I'm using the EMA. I always use the EMA but um yeah around around 100. I could totally see that. The levels that I see Bitcoin going to number one the number one big resistance levels right is the 38.2 Fibonacci that's at 97,800. So let's just let's just call it 97K. Okay, not only is that a big big resistance, but that's also like a liquidity area, which uh Philip talked about. Liquidity is where the whales and the exchanges are pushing prices to now and where they easily can because there's really not a lot of liquidity in the markets. I mean, for Bitcoin, it's a bit different, but when it comes to altcoins right now, there's such little liquidity in the market that they could they could push the price 50% in just a couple days, stop everyone out, and then reverse it and then, you know, keep on its merry way, right? And just collect all the fees, collect all the funding, collect all the stop- losses, and the exchanges win, the market makers win. That's that's how they win. So, honestly, my strategy right now is it involves liquidity hunting and and placing bids and um basically like for to buy or to sell in in liquidity zones right now because I just know how this is I know how this is played, right? So, that's one thing. And um thank you. Thank you. Have fun at have fun at the uh comic store. Trump bump it when you you stole it from Venezuela. All right. appreciate that. And um so so yeah, there's a few levels that I do want to look at on the bigger time frame for for BTC. One's obviously 97K for the 38.2 uh Fibonacci. The next one is the 61.8, which is around $108,000. Um will it come up there? You know, that's that's anyone's guess. If you actually zoom out even more, zoom out even more. You could you could say that this is starting to form a head and shoulders. Like here's this left shoulder, here's the head, and now it's going to come back up, form a right shoulder, hit the 61.8, and then, you know, fall back down. Does that seem out of bounds, right? Does that seem like something that that's impossible to happen? Not really. It seems like something that's very probable to happen, to be honest. What's actually, now that I think about it, what's probably going to happen is it's going to pump all the way up to to like 116 to like get all the all the doubters out and then it's going to and then it's going to dump. I wouldn't be surprised to see that because there's there's absolutely a ton of liquidity right there. Um, but yeah, as of right now, I'm I'm bearish and um on the overall market cycle. I think I think the market cycle is over. We fell below, you know, the gigantic gigantic support that's been holding us up since 2023. And that's I mean, we fell below that. We fell below the 200 day EMA. Um, and it's like pretty obvious it. So, if we do pump up to and and we continue this cycle and this just ends up going all the way up to, you know, 150,000, I'm going to be super super um shocked about that. However, I'm not just going to stick with my with my thesis that that it's over right now or that that the market cycle is over if we start pumping and things get bullish again. So, this is going to be I guess I don't know topic number five now on big big ideas that you must have as a trader that most people in crypto don't have. Um, yo yo, where's Guy at? Guy, if you're watching this, let me know. All right. Um, I'm going to answer this in one question. One question. Uh, one second. I mean, so the other big thing so far, so far I went through my trading style, which is like bigger picture, like big areas. I want to go into the areas where I have high confidence in where I think there's a very high probability of something working out in and I don't want to get caught up in the minutia. I don't want to get caught up in the noise. That's number one. Number two is I always look at the at the at the Wall Street cheat sheet uh psychology of a of a market cycle charts and I always try to think where are we in the market cycle. Okay, that's a big picture thing that I always look at. Right. The third thing that I look at is is in terms of market cycles. Where do I think we are in terms of the length? So, the timing of it is another thing, right? And then on top of that, I have the price action and I have uh certain indicators like the moving average and stuff like that like we fall below it. Um, we have the price action creating bearish market structure. We have all of this stuff, right? These are a lot of different components that that go in that are metrics that I use in my data to uh inform me inform my decision. Right now, the thing that most people, 99% of people on crypto Twitter and in crypto and probably in general don't understand is that as a trader, and this is a trading channel, so you're you might understand this, you'll probably understand this, but most people don't, is that traders are like water and they can maneuver and they could change their bias and they could change their thesis. So my thesis right now is I want to get out of Bitcoin at around 97K. Why? Because well, we're in a bare market. We're going down. This is a big big resistance. It's a big liquidity zone. It's a Fibonacci. It's the huge SR flip area. There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of stuff, a lot of confluence. What we call when a lot of things come together, that's called confluence comes together at the at this area. It's and it's at the 200 day move EMA, right? So, okay. So, I'll sell here. Let's say it keeps on going up. Well, what's what am I just going to be like, oh, I sold here. I'm never buying in again ever again. No, of course I'm not going to do that. Of course, I'm not going to do that. Say it keeps on going up, keeps on going up, keeps going. Okay. Okay. Well, then you say, hey, look, I was wrong. I was wrong about this. What do I need to do in order to get back in? Well, uh, how about, I don't know, get back in on a pullback. Okay, so let's say it goes all the way up here. What can you do now? Get in on a pullback. Okay, get in here. And then let's say it goes all the way down. It keeps on going down. And and then it's back into a bearish market structure. Okay. Well, then you change again. And you change it again. And you say, \"Okay, well, what am I going to do now? I'm going to get out. I'm going to get out on a bounce.\" That's it's that simple. It's that simple. It's not it's not like, oh, I'm bearish, so so I'm completely sidelined and I'm out of the market forever and I'm never going to go back in. So if it goes back up, I'm, you know, I'm out of it. And it's not going to be like, oh, I'm so bullish. I'm bullish. I'm bullish. And then it starts to go down and then it's like, oh, I'm still in it. I'm still in it. I'm still in it. And it's like, no, I'm going to get out on a bounce if I'm bearish. I'm going to get in on a pullback if I'm bullish. Okay. All right. So, what was the uh what was the Hey, didn't don't Hey, man. Philip, don't you have a comic store you need to go to? I'm just playing. You could stay here. Um, all right, Lewis, I have a question for you. Do you think market makers will let all traders use the same fractal as 2021, a dead cat bounce to around 107K, and then all traders take a ride down to the bottom? Well, the thing is that there's going to be a lot of people that if it does come back up to 107K, a lot of people are just going to FOMO back in. So, so it's like a lot of times, this is honestly like it's sort of crazy. It's sort of crazy to say this, but a lot of times just using the most simple technical analysis, support, resistance, whatever market structure breaks, whatever, seems to work really well. It seems to work really well. I mean, I made a few videos on Ethereum back in September, not to toot my own horn, but when back in September before the big liquidation event, I was like I was like, it's over. like it's it's 100% over. Why? Because because what happened with I was looking at Ethereum and I saw Ethereum. It hit the previous 2021 highs in November. Okay, you can see it hit that right here around just under 5K. Just under 5K and then it and then it fell down. It went back up and then it fell down and it broke the market structure to the downside because it made a lower low right right here compared to compared to right here. Okay. It It's never done that, you know. High uh sorry, low high, higher low, higher high, higher low, higher high, higher low, lower high, lower low. That was a break in the market structure on the weekly time frame that was negative after hitting the most biggest resistance possible, which was the previous all-time high. That's super bearish. That's like in the most bearish thing you could possibly have done. And the only way that it would get to be bullish again is if it closed back above the previous highs which are right here at, you know, 4,600. So, so this was the time it was like it was pretty obvious to sell if you're looking at Ethereum. Bitcoin was a different story. But I look I like Ethereum uh when it comes to determining what I'm going to do with my altcoins because uh it literally it happened it happened in 2021 as well. Like the same thing happened in 2021 like when Ethereum started going bad. Um altcoins basically went bad. So, I look at Ethereum and I and I track Ethereum in order to track my altcoin portfolio. Um, and determine whether it's a good thing or a bad thing to, you know, be into alts. Um, and so your thoughts on ETH BTC over the next few weeks? Sure. So, sure. I got you. I got you. So, so anyway, what's the obvious thing before you go into your minutia and and and start pinpointing, you know, micro on a micro scale, uh, what scalp you're going to do, like like, yeah, you could do that if you're scalping, but have the big picture in mind as well. And where are the big levels? Like, where's the big levels? I'll go to ETH against BTC for this because I have the big levels in here. Wh What's the biggest level for me? Well, the biggest level for me is this area right here around uh 0 3612 like right around this area. It's the weekly bearish order block, which I'll get into the order blocks and breakers and and and change of structure and all this other stuff like later down the road. But like basically this was the high that happened. This was the move up before the big move down. And that's that's the easiest way to explain it. It's the bearish order block and it it's now the resistance. And if we come into if we go into the daily time frame, what happened when we came back into it? Well, you know, we hit it and then we crashed back down. So, if we come back up to it again, it's it's the resistance. Be more careful at the resistance, right? Like like it's it's it's pretty easy stuff, right? So, and even even looking at the let's go to the weekly chart and look at look at where the Ethereum bottomed out. It bottomed out right here, right? Let's go back down. Let's take this zoom it out all the way to the left. It pretty much bottomed out like at at the same spot where it bottomed out back in January of 2020. So, it's like if you were waiting to get into Ethereum uh to switch your Bitcoin into Ethereum, like this was the time. This was like this was the obviously this was it's like you could say, \"Oh yeah, obviously it's the time now.\" But like also it was obvious it was the time because it was the sorry it was the biggest support area like of history. So it's like what what do you what's going to happen if it comes all the way back up here? Let's say it goes all the way back up to you know back up here. What are you going to do? Obviously it would be good to sell, right? Um so so it's like yeah like like I think a lot of people they over complicate it and um they they get so caught up in the in the lower time frames and so caught up in in the noise and so caught up in the fact that like they'll go on crypto Twitter and they'll see a million they'll see like all of these all of these people hyping so many things up and uh just just talking all of this craziness. iness and um like it it's not even a big move. Like it's like the move isn't even that big and yet and and and then you know you'll either buy or you sell because you'll get FOMO in one way or the other, right? So always take a step back and just breathe and uh look at it look at it on the higher time frame and uh think of like what the big levels look like, right? and and and go with that. So, man, there's All right, it's 9 It's 9:20. I don't want this to be like too long, but uh I do want to be doing these streams um often. And I think what I'll do is I'll have like a lesson and I'll just uh I'll just like make a lesson like within the stream and then also like share my share my thoughts of the market and everything like that. I shared I shared my thoughts of the market with you guys like right now. Uh essentially like yeah I'm still bear I'm still bearish and like if we do happen to move up I'd be selling like all of my Bitcoin but like I'm not going to I'm not going to be buying things like like I'll look at Pepe right like I'll look at Pepe like I'm not going to be buying this right now right like because unless there's unless there's a reason like unless there's like a big reason um fundamentally to buy something. I just don't see I just really like don't see the reason why unless like I talked about in the beginning, you put on a position and and you have a stop that that makes sense, right? Like let's say your stop is like here like and that you're putting it here because you think it's just going to keep on going up and it's not going to have a pullback and this is below, you know, this low and and this low and and all of these other lows, right? Okay. I mean, that's a trade thesis that you could take. You could you could do it. I don't know how well it it works out to be honest because like what I do is I wait I wait I wait until something happens until the coin and the price reaches the level that I know is a good level and um thank you. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So anyway, I I wait until until the price comes down to a good level that I am comfortable with buying and then I'll either buy a little bit like immediately, but typically if I'm going to go in with more and I'm going to risk, you know, a few percentage like 1 2 3% of my account or something like that, I'll wait until something happens on the chart. And by what by something happening on the chart, what I mean is I'll wait until the chart tells me it's a good time, it's a good idea to buy. um usually and that's price action. Okay, that's PA for short, price action. And that is the first thing that I think everyone should probably learn about is price action. And price action, it's simply like each candlestick on the chart. And so each candlestick on the chart, each candlestick on the chart, I'll go back to Bitcoin, tells you a story between the bulls and the bears. And if you could learn to read them correctly, then that will make you such a better trader. I remember I remember I was trading for like two years before I really just decided to sit down and I read this book called um naked naked trading and uh it's only it's literally the only thing that it is is the patterns is is the chart patterns of the candlesticks. That's it. and it just talks about the the candlesticks and understanding the um understanding the candlesticks. And that helped me so much. It helped me so much in my trading. And so that's what I do now. It's like it's like I look at the candlesticks and then I add everything else on top of it. So if you are trading, if you're a trader, you're watching Coin Bureau trading right now and and you're seeing what should I do? like what is something that I could do that will significantly increase my trading capabilities and you don't have a immense understanding of candles if you don't know what this means like what this candle means if you don't know what these these two candles combined if you don't know what that means or this or these then study candlesticks that's the first thing to study okay candlesticks and then probably risk management would be the best the best use of your time after that. Um, by the way, I do have a um, dude, you're you're hilarious, man. I do have a a channel. If you just type my name in, Lewis Rascin, in YouTube, um, do it after the stream. I do have a risk a video on risk management. Um, yeah, Lewis Rascin risk management. You'll see you'll see a big video I made. It's like over an hour long on risk management. Highly recommend it. But um the other thing and the other thing is is understanding is understanding candlesticks individual candlesticks because a lot of people what they'll do is they'll learn chart patterns. They'll learn chart patterns like like you know the head and shoulders or the rising wedge or the triangle but they don't understand the the candles that happen in between like like each and every tick right or each and each and every candle. And understanding the candles will help you so much more than understanding the patterns. the patterns are built on top of the candles. Okay. So, what I'm going to do probably is uh yeah, I'll create I'll create like a um I'll create like a list of different topics that I want to talk about and and basically share with you guys and go over and then I'll just go over them and and share my knowledge about it because I have been trading for eight years like non-stop uh essentially looking at charts nearly every single day. Although uh recently, like I mentioned, I've stopped looking at them every single day and I start I backed off a little bit and I like to look at the bigger picture uh type things, set alerts, um use different uh not like I guess you could call them bots. Yeah. Like I like I created my own custom custom bots and things like that which have been like tremendously helpful. And uh I'll get into those later because those are all more advanced topics. But I'll just go through like like pretty much everything that you need to know for and I'll give you my take on it because it's good to get everyone, you know, different takes. Um and then I'll do that. So if you have anything if you have like anything that you are interested in, drop it in the chat and uh I um and I'll and I'll go over it. I'll I'll put a I'll put it in on the list, you know, to go over it. So essentially though, essentially though, Bitcoin, you know, right now 93.3 94K. Obviously, it's looking good, but from a trader perspective, we're at another we're at a huge we're at a resistance at the resistance at the range. And um there's two areas where you don't want to long. The two areas where you don't want to long are 99% of the time. There are certain occasions where you do where you will long on these occasions, but most of the time the two areas where you don't want to long are at the at the resistance. I'll make it a red red triangle at the resistance, right? Triangle. It's a it's a freaking uh rectangle and in the middle. So, aka no man's land. So, if you look at this right here and you just look at this as like a range, right? This is this is the bottom of the range. This is the top of the range. Bottom of the range, top of the range. And you look at this as as a range. Okay? Where don't where do you want to long? You do want to long down here at the support. Okay? Where don't you want to long at the resistance. And you also don't want to long in the middle because you don't know what could happen. You really don't know what could happen in the middle, you know? Like it could it could keep on going up, but it could also just do what it did like here and just go back down and trick you and then and then go back up, right? It's called no man's land for a reason. So, you got to set your zones, right? You got to you got to set your zones, set your alerts, maybe set small orders in these areas in the areas that you feel confident in and then just wait and be patient. And that's the game plan. That's the game plan for as long as we are um you know in these in this type of environment like as long as we're in this type of environment where it's choppy and rangebound. That's my game plan because honestly even this even back here in October and um November and yeah October and November this was honestly not difficult to trade. Why was this not difficult to trade? Because we made a move down and we broke the market structure. We broke below the previous lows which typically we don't do and then we made a move up created an equal high a very bearish candle and then we made another lower low. So, it was in a downtrend. It was in clear downtrend at that point. So, what can you do? You could say, \"All right, well, I'm going to short a move up and I'll short.\" And I would probably have shorted it like at around 107, like 500. So, it just it just missed it. The area where I personally would have shorted it, but like that would the play is like, \"Hey, the trend is going down. Let's short it as it comes back up and have it continue to go down.\" And the price will continue going down. Likewise, if you scroll back just a little bit, you know, the price is like here, the price is going up. Okay, so what do you want to do? Well, you want to long it. You want to go long on pullbacks as the price goes up. So, you know, people, it's like they're crazy. Like the way that they the way that they just like throw out throw so much stuff out there and just talk with their emotions and stuff. Um, it's just nuts to me. And so a lot of the times I like to just drown all of the noise out and stop listening to anyone else. And like this is this is honestly this is the year where like I'm really not I'm going to be do I do my own analysis, right? Because a lot of times you look at other people and um you just Oh, is she? And uh so say what up to Gabby for me. Okay. Okay, Phillip. Um, and so yeah, you just got to you just got to really like study and figure out figure it out on your own or you got to find someone who actually knows what they're doing and um and and and follow them. But like the problem is that there's a lot of people who don't know what they're doing in in this space. Uh but yeah, if you could if you could find someone and it makes sense to you and you go back and you back test it and you and you forward test it and you trade it yourself and you like it, then that's that's the way to go. That's the way to do it. But be fluid. Always be able to change your bias. Always be able to change, you know, uh your long or your shorts. Um use stops. Don't get stopped out. And I think that's pretty much it unless anyone else has any questions. Um, I know there's probably I mean I don't know how many people are are watching this right now. Um, because Yeah. Where does it where does it actually show that I got to I want to I want to check. Yeah, I'll go over here. But regardless, that should be it. That should be it. Uh, we'll see if we do hit the 97K. I think we will. And, um, when we do, that's when I'm going to be scaling out of my Bitcoin that I have. And after that, um, if we do keep on going up, if we do keep on going up, I'm going to start looking for short positions. And, um, that's thing. So, I'll keep you guys updated with it. Also on the main channel, I have like a five minute snippet in the um on the live stream on the main channel. So you could watch those. But I'll probably be doing this a lot more um either Mondays or on Thursdays. But this I'm down I'm down to make a bet. I'm down to make a bet. I'm down to do. You know, we are almost gamblers, but not really. What's your bet? What's your bet? If it's a dead cat balance, I give a bear in Romania. Uh, if not, you give a beer. A beer, not a bear. I don't really want a bear, but uh and I I actually don't drink beer either, but I will um I'll have a I don't know. I'll have like a mocktail or uh No, I'll I'll I'll have one. I'll have one. Might as well whenever I'm I'm not in London, though. Why do you think I'm in Do you think I'm in London? You know what's funny the now that now that I'm doing a live stream right now. Um hold on a second though. Hold on a second. We got these banners down here. We got these banners down here. And um it's covering it's like I didn't even realize I didn't even realize that it's covering my face. Like it's covering half of my face. I need to I need to like come up a little bit like this. So, let me let me see if I could change this to uh look a little bit better. Even though I don't know I don't know I you ever have so many tabs open that you lose track of what you were you know of where you are like meme coins pumping across the board just dead cat for them or a few more weeks of this. Okay that's a that's a that's a good question. Um, I highly doubt that we're going to get weeks of of upward movements because if you like typically even during the bull market, it wasn't for most most memecoins and most altcoins, we never had weeks of upward movement, right? We just had um days really, maybe one week. I think like two weeks was two or three weeks was like the max that we had um on like on like seasons like alt season or like the seasons of like moving up, right? So I would say like a week I usually give like it a week max uh when coins go like parabolic when coins go like really really uh strongly up when they have huge moves before they turn around. However, because we're in this like you know bare market right now, I'd give it I I'd be I don't think it's going to last more than five days. I don't think it's going to last more than five days to be honest before um things you know turn back around until we hit the bottom. Until we hit the bottom and then once we hit the bottom and there is the and we do have hit the bottom then maybe it could last for a couple weeks. But typically, typically it's Bitcoin that pumps first and then and then coins, other coins. But let's be real. I just typed in meme. Let's be real here. What What are the coins that did really really well this cycle? Okay, there was like Fartcoin. Like look at how well Fartcoin did, right? Insane, right? 6,000%. There was there was SPX 6,900. All right. A lot of these coins, a lot of people, okay, this will this will be topic number six or seven when you're trading, remove your ego. Remove your biases. Not necessarily your biases, but remove your ego. Don't say, \"Oh, meme coins. I would never trade meme coins.\" Okay, look at what you missed out on. Look at what you missed out on. You missed out on the biggest runners of the entire cycle. And it wasn't even just this cycle. Last cycle it was the same thing. Last cycle Dogecoin was the biggest runner. This cycle all of these meme coins, S&P6900, Fartcoin, Toshi, all of these coins, Popcat, these are the coins that made I don't know I know one person who made millions of dollars with Bitcoin. I know a dozen people that made millions of dollars with altcoins. I mean with meme and with memecoins particular. I know like three people who made a million who made over a million dollars with Popcat, right? I know like all of my biggest plays other than KTA this cycle were memecoins. That's where I made like the vast majority of my money. So don't like like do whatever you want, but my trading style is I want to look at what what is actually where's the liquidity going into, right? like who's actually getting the money? Like where where is the money going? Because that's Oh, my StreamYard's right here. Because that's how you can make the most amount of money, right? Like I want Yes, I wanted of course I wanted utility coins to, you know, do really well. But guess what? The market didn't care and the market went into meme coins. All right? And that's why they ended up outperforming everybody because the people who got into memecoins outperformed everybody, you know? So, so go into what go into what is getting the liquidity, right? Go into where the money is actually going, right? But don't go into them don't go into them holding like and saying, \"Hey, yeah, so I'm in here.\" Oh, what up, Allan? What up? Okay, we uh more risk, more money. Not even not even more risk. Not even more risk. Why? Why, dude? Look at Look at every single um look at every single First off First off, forget utility coins. Look at Ethereum. Look at E. Ethereum literally Ethereum went down 66%. Last year it went down 66%. You're going to lose 66% of your money or you're going to lose, you know, 80 or 90% of your money. Like it's pretty much the same risk except the upside is so much more. The upside, you know, I just showed you Fartcoin. It went up 6,000%. Ethereum went up 261%. Right? Like like there's this is why this this is why you have to manage your risk. Have your Bitcoin in your core portfolio. Have a core portfolio. Have Bitcoin that you never touch. Have Bitcoin that you dollar cost average into. But like if you're a trader and you're trading, there are co like go to where the money's at, right? go to where the money's at because when things go bad, they're going to go bad either way. They're going to go down regardless no matter what. You know, you're telling me it really matters. I mean I mean I guess 50% versus versus 80% or whatever is a big difference. But trail your stops like how I forgot who said it, but um you know, trail your stops. trail your stop losses up and um you'll do fine, you know, or I you know, I don't know if you'll do fine, but but but have a game plan and um yeah, go to where the money's at. I trade everything, man. I trade I I'll I'll trade meme coins day more than more than anything else because memecoins go up the most and everything goes down in crypto eventually except for Bitcoin. So like Bitcoin is the only one that like obviously it's here to stay. It's number one, right? And probably Ethereum at this point too. Um maybe Salana, but like yeah like like you the purpose the purpose of crypto. This is the goal. This is the goal. And this took me a while. This actually did take me a while to learn. Um which is like sad to say. I wonder if I could actually let me let me see if I could do this. Now I'm a little bit bigger. Okay, I'm a little bit bigger. So the purpose of crypto is this. You have Bitcoin, right? And like Michael Sailor says, there is Bitcoin. It's the best. There is no second best, right? So you want to stack SATs. You want to stack Bitcoin. So why would you get into anything else? Well, you get into something else if it you think it's going to outperform Bitcoin, right? However, the risk is basically the same on almost everything else. Everything else is going to fall, you know, by 50 60 70 80 90%. Right? It it has the opportunity of falling. So, if you're going to risk if you're going to risk that much going into these coins, why not go into the coins that have the the asymmetric upside if the risk is essentially the same? Why not go into the ones that actually have the opportunity to massively outperform Bitcoin, right? Otherwise, you're taking on a lot of risk to marginally outperform Bitcoin. That doesn't make too much sense. Just stick with Bitcoin if you're going to do that, right? But that's how almost everyone that's how almost everyone in this in this space works. Oh, I'm going to go into I'm going to go into like Aptose, you know? Like why would you go Why would you go into Aptose? Like Like you go into Aptose, you go into like an L1, like a new L1. You go into them right right when they're right when they come out or you go into them like at the very key moments at the very key moments like um right before right before alt season you know this right this right here uh no right like this right here this was right before alt season this is like okay good time to go in right but it's going to fall again it's you know I don't people. I have a I just have a very different way of of thinking about things because because think of think of the most amount of money you've you've made in crypto. What was it from? I've studied the people I've studied a lot of people who have made a lot of money, right? And the people who made the most money are the other than the scammers and the people who just use their copy traders the ex as exit liquidity and stuff like that. The people who made the money, most money are the people who got into stuff super early, like super super super early and and essentially held like, you know, S&P Murad, he got an SPX. It's I don't know why it's not I don't know why it's not on here, but like he got into it super super early way down here, way over here, and he just held it. He just held it and held it and held it, right? And then and then it did this, right? the people who I know who who who got who made millions in Popcat, you know, they got into Popcat somewhere somewhere around somewhere around here, you know, somewhere around here and they just they just held it. And actually, I know someone else who got a Popcat. He got a he got a Popcat here and he and it fell. It fell it fell. It fell fell 66% from where he got in. And he he held that. He he freaking held it. And then it went down 70% again and he held it and it ended up it ended up you know skyrocketing and going up. So you want a good strategy. You want a good strategy. Wait until the things are down so so so much. And then you have to think you have to think of the narrative and you have to think of future consequences. What's going to happen in the future? Right. Like like there this is one this is one uh that my buddy did really well on. Really really really well on Toshi, right? Why get into Toshi? Why why would you buy Toshi super super super early? Well, you would have gotten in got into it early because you would have seen that the car n the narratives were all about cat coins, right? It was all about first it was all about dogs and then it switched into going into cats and there was all of these animal animal coins that were going crazy, right? So, what what what do you do? What's the what's the thing to do? This is the wrong Toshi actually. Um I think it was on the base chain. Well, the thing to do would be to go into a coin that has the narrative around it that is that h has a reason for people to buy it. Like the Toshi is is uh Brian Armstrong's cat or something like that, right? So, okay, cool. Buy it. Wait until the thesis pans out. And then if the thesis pans out, you're you're you made a lot of money. If the thesis doesn't pan out, okay, you lost. you lost on that trade, but there's another thesis. Just chill and wait until you come up with another reason, another coin to get into that has good reasons behind it as to why it should do very very well. But don't just buy and buy and buy and buy and buy, you know. And um you same same deal with PopCap, bro. Um, no. The thing about the thing about shorting the the thing about shorting coins right now, altcoins right now, which I don't like to do, is that is that they have the opportunity to do this, you know? So, and I'll I'll I'll make the screen more I'll make the screen big again. Is that they have the opportunity to do this. So, you could be right. You could literally be right and short it, you know, perfectly and and be in the short and then, you know, one day goes by or a few days go by and it it takes out all of your shorts. It takes out it takes out everything and you get back all your gains. So, there's not enough liquidity in the markets. That's what I'm saying. That's what I mentioned earlier. There's not enough liquidity in the markets right now to do any like big time trades necessarily except for maybe on on a few coins because the market makers and the exchanges are they're just going to stop you out. Like they're just going to push the price all the way up or all the way down, stop you out and then go back go in the other direction. It's very easy to do that at this point. Um so unless you're scalping, if you're scalping, that's a different story. You could scalp. You could do you could do shorter trades and you could you could always make money. You could always find a way doing shortterm trades to make money, right? Scalps. But um yeah, like like right now for swing trading, it's like this. It's like we're in a downtrend. We're in a bare market. So, are you going to buy buy low thinking that it that you're swing trading something when there's a probability, a high probability that the market will eventually come back down and stop you out because it's with the trend if you happen to long it. um or are you going to short it knowing that there's a high probability that the exchanges and the market makers are going to pump it up and stop you out of your short too as well? Like you need to get you need to make sure that that the price is in a really good area. Um and then trail your stops. That's what I would do. trail trail stops to make sure that that you don't lose money because the number one rule, the best thing you could do right now is not lose money, right? Protect your capital so that when things get easy again, you could go in hard as heck and you could actually make a lot of money because you saved money and you weren't trying to trade when things were so so so difficult, right? That's that's alpha right there. The other thing is set alerts at key levels to make sure you know when to go back in to make sure you are alerted, right? Let's let's make a short. I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't short it right now. I wouldn't short it right now. This is not where I want to look for shorts. Like remember what I'm talking about earlier. I'm like set your areas of interest. Set your areas of interest. Where are you interested in taking shorts? I'm interested in taking shorts up around 97,000. That's where I would be cool with taking a short because the probab if it does pump up there, the probability of it going down is much much greater than the probability of it going down, you know, from lower from right here. Even though we are at we are at the previous resistance, we are at this, you know, big resistance area. I don't know why this is green to be honest. Did I just I think I just like put this in here for to show you guys earlier. But like yeah, I I'm not comfortable going with short. And also what I was talking about earlier when it comes to price action, if you're if you look at this, this is this is uh this is something that I used to do that that messed me that that cost me a lot of money that I don't do anymore. Look at this chart. We are in this range, right? We're in this range like I mentioned before. Okay. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And now we're at the highs again. We're at the highs again. So, you might think to yourself, \"Oh, the resistance. Here's the support. I want to sell at the resistance. I want to buy at the support.\" And you might be correct. In fact, you're going to be correct most of the time if you just do that. Just do that as the only strategy, right? However, there are going to be times where the price just pumps straight straight through either the support or the resistance, right? So, to have a little bit more certainty, what you could do is you could have an alert go off when it hits when it hits the zone and then just check it every few hours. So, going on the 12-h hour chart, going down to the 4our chart and just wait and just wait, maybe even the one hour chart. Okay? and just look at the price and wait until at least there's some confirmation or something on the lower time frames that shows you, hey, look, it's time to go short now, right? That's going to save you so much pain because there's going to be so many times where you're going to go short, but then the price is just going to rip right through it. But if you wait and let's say the price ends up doing something like this. Okay, boom. And it makes a lower low. It actually makes a lower low because as you can see right now, you know, this is the low and then it made a higher low and then it made a higher low and and essentially it's made it's made a high higher high, a little bit of a higher high, higher high. It's making higher highs and higher lows consistently. It's not showing any signs of slowing down. So, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna short something that is not showing any signs of slowing down. Even though it's at the resistance, even though it's at the resistance, I'm not going to preemptively short. I'm going to wait I'm going to wait until on the lower time frames it shows me something. And I actually have a video if you type in Lewis Rascin trend lines, I'm pretty sure that's going to be the video. It'll show it'll show you what I'll show you right now. Typically, typically, you know, price goes like this, right? Like price ends up going like this. So, so what does that mean? That means that you could have a trend line like this and then you could have a trend line like this and then you could have a trend line like this, right? The trend lines get steeper and steeper and steeper. So you could you could plot these trend lines out like how I did it right here, right? And you could just let's say let's say that another trend line happens. So you could you know and it goes like this. This is going to be the second trend line. You could wait until the trend line gets broken and that's going to give you confirmation that hey look now might be a good time to short. But but if the price is just going up and up and up like this and the trend lines are getting steeper, what's to say what's to say it's not going to go like this next, you know, and the price isn't going to go like that, right? But if you do it, if you do draw this trend line out like this and then the price does dip does finally dip underneath of it. Okay, boom. You could short, you could put your stop right above here and you're solid. You have a you have a stop loss, a predetermined you have a you have a a way to determine exactly how much you're going to lose if you get stopped out at that point, right? And that's the way professionals do it. And that's that's the way to uh make sure that you don't lose too much money and you manage your risk correctly. Okay. Uh and that's something like I mentioned, that's something that I learned after years of trading. Took me a while. Um took me a while to figure this out, but yeah, it's like silver. It's like it's like silver. I'm not going to I'm not going to short silver right now, right? I'm not going to I'm not going to long it. Of course, I'm not going to long it even though I do think like it still has a lot of room to run. I'm not going to long it. But what I could do is plot this out. I could plot this out. Okay. And the first one you could see, you could see already what was the first one? The first one was was right here. All right. And this actually looks like it formed an ascending triangle and then it broke out of the ascending triangle. All right. And now the second trend line is this trend line right here. Okay. Now the third trend line. I'm guessing if I had to guess this is probably the bottom. And uh it's probably going to go up and do something like this. And so I think silver is probably going to end up, you know, up here. And then what you could do is like wait and then see if it if it does happen to let's say it does, you know, happen to pump or whatever. It pumps up, pumps up. Okay. Well, once it does and then it finally breaks this trend line and it closes underneath of it like how it closed, you know, like like it has not closed underneath of the trend line yet. Like it it never closed underneath here. I wonder if I could pull this back actually. No, I can't do it. Like it never closed underneath this one and then hasn't closed underneath this one. Like if this closed down here, I'd probably I'd be fine shorting it. Like I'd say, \"Yeah, that makes sense.\" But like it hasn't, right? So, it's also it's also a possibility that it that silver, you know, like stays above here and and oh, my bad, wrong one. And and does something like like this first and then goes up. Um, but it really like you have to count the clo I count the closes. That's what I do. And um then I'd be comfortable shorting it. Yeah, of course, man. Of course, I'll be open to looking at individual charts on my streams. anything. Anything. This is why I do the live streams. It's literally to look at like interact with you guys, right? So I'm not in my mom's basement, you know, all the time and I could actually interact with a human being cuz all I got now are my imaginary friends and uh I don't know where I'm going with this to be honest, but no. Yeah. Yeah. Have have whatever whatever charts obviously throw the charts in here. I'll do them. And um they could be anything. Literally anything. And uh it'll be cool. It'll be cool cuz then I could look back and, you know, test them out and stuff like that. Also, maybe what I'll do is uh actually have a create like an account, put like $1,000 or maybe $5,000 into it. And then I will take a trade like in my stream like in the stream or not take I won't take a trade but I will talk about a trade that I will plan to take unless I happen to be on stream and I happen to see a trade setup on stream that makes sense. Then I'll take it and then I'll like track it and I'll see how well it did. I'll see how well the portfolio did because and then and then we could track it. I don't know if I'm going to do it, but like it would be cool. And then we could track it with the one that's on the Coin Bureau main channel. Um, you know, on their live stream because there's people that they have their own their own thing, right? That um the thing the thing the thing why I mentioned why I mentioned I won't take the trades I won't take a trade unless I happen to see it perfectly set up is because I don't take trades unless they are perfectly set up. That's the thing. That's the thing. So, it's like, you know, I'm looking at Bitcoin right now. It's like, do I think it's going to go to 97? Yes, I do. But, am I going to long it right now? No, I'm not. Because it's already it's already up here. Where would What would a really good trade setup look like when it comes to Bitcoin? Well, I'll show you actually. I'll show you. Um, okay. It's coming down. It's It's coming down. It's coming down. Where do I Where Let's say it was Let's say like this. Actually, no. I need to come down a I need to go back a little bit more. Um, let's say that it was that it was like here. Where would the where would the first trade setup that I would look to long would be? It would be if it hit this trend line, right? Because this was the big trend line forever, right? Around uh so around 94 95K. That's where I would have wanted to look for long positions. But um and I'll go to I'll go to the daily time frame and then I'll show you like like it it it showed a little bit it showed a little bit of a of a bounce here but nothing that like really was like oh man like I need to long like I have to long it now. And that's why if it's it showed some slowing down but it it was a lot of indecision very much indecision around the original area where I wanted to long and then it fell and then it just fell underneath of it. Right. So, where's the next area that I would want want to have longed it? Well, it would have been it would have been 80,600 because that that's the golden ratio, right? So, that's where that's the next area that I would have wanted to long. And it doesn't to me it doesn't matter what happens. It doesn't matter what happens until it gets to the area where I want to long. Anything could happen in between. It's all noise. Okay? I will only take trades if they come into the areas where I want to long it. And so, let's see. It came in. It came into this area. Um, it tapped it and then it and then it it tapped again and it shot up. So, I don't see anything here. But maybe if I go down to a lower time frame, I could see I I see like I see like okay, it did make somewhat of a nice bullishness over here, but still to me still to me I I probably wouldn't have longed it uh around here. I would have I would have had to wait. I would have been waiting. So what I'll do is I would wait and I would keep on pressing. I would keep on, you know, waiting and waiting and waiting until like finally, let me I'll just I'll just go to the I'll just, you know, do the whole thing until finally what I would have done and what I would have seen I know I saw it here. Um I forgot what time frame it was on, but there was something that I saw that was super super bullish. Maybe if I take this here. Oh, that was it. Yeah. So, I would have taken the fib from here to here, from like this move up, and I would have saw, okay, this looks pretty bullish to me. Like, this is a bullish candle. I'll long it here. I'll put my stop right underneath of it because it's a it's a I'll know how much I'm going to lose. And I would just And that would have been my trade setup. That would have been my trade setup because like to me, this makes sense. I know it probably does. Maybe it doesn't make sense to everybody, but like putting on a trade like let me let me ah okay putting on a trade right here like at this candle would have made a lot of sense to me because it's in like it's in a good zone. It's it's it's near the 61.8 golden ratio. We're we're making an uptrend. Like there's just a lot of confluences over here. Um but right now obviously there's not really something that I could do. Uh but yeah, anyway, if I have a position to take live, I'll take it live. Uh and I think I'll just end this here because it's 10 o'clock, so it's been an hour and a half and I've been talking um for a while. So, I appreciate you guys for for coming out. I gotta find a way to get these banners like moved or I don't know, move me up a little bit so you y'all could see me a little bit more a little bit better because obviously I can't have this going on. But yeah, I'm going to do that. And if you have any have any uh coins you want me to chart when I'm on the stream, just drop them in the chat and I'll do that. With that, thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next week probably. All right, peace out.",
