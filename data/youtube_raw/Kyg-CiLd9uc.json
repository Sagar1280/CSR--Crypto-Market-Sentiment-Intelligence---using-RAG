  "transcript": "When I make an investment decision, it's usually sometimes, believe it or not, the idea comes from the charts, but I will never invest just on a chart. >> Billionaire investor Stanley Ducken Miller, who has been bullish on Bitcoin since 2020. >> I'm a bit of a dinosaur, but I have warmed up to the fact that um Bitcoin could be an asset class [clears throat] that has a lot of attraction to it as a store of value. perfectly explains in this clip from years ago perfectly explains why an asset like Bitcoin hasn't exploded yet. But the only variable is time. You see, even though the setup for crypto has never been stronger, there's macro money printing in 2026, positive legislation coming. Even the SEC is tokenizing all of traditional finance and bringing it on chain. >> Tokenization is an innovation. Fundamentally, the outlook for crypto in 2026 and beyond has never been stronger. Yet, sometimes it's the technical analysis, the technical setup that prevents big money from investing in a fundamentally bullish asset class, but that will not last forever. Let's watch this two-minute clip, then I'll react. >> Yeah, the technical versus fundamentals. When you're making an investment decision or a trading decision, how do you how do you piece the two together? How much time do you spend looking at charts today? >> Okay, so every night at about 4:30 I get 272 charts. Um they cover um just about every group in the stock market, every commodity, every currency cross I'm interested in, every fixed income market around the world. And they're basically daily, weekly, and monthly. Daily is supposed to predict 8 to 20 days, weekly 8 to 20 weeks, and uh monthly 8 to 20 months. Um when I make an investment decision, it's usually sometimes, believe it or not, the idea comes from the charts, but I will never invest just on a chart. But if I really like a fundamental thesis and the chart stinks, I won't do it. There's, you know, my my old boss used to say in terms of socks, I apologize to the women in the audience. There's 6,000 girls out there. You know, if 20 or 30 of them look great, I don't need to bother with the rest. And you can always find, at least in terms of equities, 20 or 30 great fundamental stories that the chart looks good. But I always assume that the market may know something. And I've always had a great deal of respect for the market. So I'd say 75 to 80% of my ideas come from fundamental and then they're verified by the chart. >> So this is the key. This is what nobody else in traditional finance or in crypto realize. But this is the speed bump right now. Why big money is taking a pause with Bitcoin and crypto. It's fundamentally it is truly never been a better outlook for crypto going forward fundamentally. But due to manipulation, due to what I would call a mini black swan event, nobody saw it coming on October 10th, which literally forced sellers. It forced all the leverage traders, forced sell at the same time, which broke the technical chart in Bitcoin's history. Anytime we break below and get a confirmation below the 50week moving average historically for the last 15 years, that has signaled a new bare market. And then the bare market usually signifies an end when we can touch the 200 week which is right now at about 57 $58,000 Bitcoin. All this big institutional money which was ready to finally go in because crypto is finally getting regulated was I would guess about to pull the trigger but then they look at the technicals and they say whoa what happened here? What does the market know that I don't? And not that crypto or Bitcoin is suddenly bad, but as Stanley Ducken Miller said, which is a great insight. I'm going to like this. I love this perspective. Great insight on how the institutions think, there's probably 20 to 30 better things that are fundamentally bullish as well as technically bullish. Why would we? Maybe let's pause. Maybe let's see how this plays out when the technicals aren't looking good. But what do we know? If you subscribe to Altcoin Daily, we understand what exactly happened here. Why do I say this was a black zone event? I loved this perspective and my last interview uh with crypto expert billionaire Arthur Hayes. This is going to get complicated. If you if you're not a trader, if you're not in the trenches with DeFi, decentralized finance, you might not understand any everything, but this is what exactly happened on October 10th. So, you know, October 10th was sort of this crash on Binance and some of the other centralized exchange. It was a it was a crash across the crypto ecosystem. Um, started on Binance for some idiosyncratic reasons. I have a, you know, there's a lot of conspiracy opinions that CZ and there's this cabal of market makers and they, you know, came up with a secret scheme to everybody over because the prices on Bitcoin and altcoins drop so precipitatively quickly. But it's very simple. There are a bunch of rules that every exchange operates under and they publish documents that nobody reads and I've been doing this for a long time and I've written a lot of these documents and a lot of my clients at DMix didn't read anything that I said until something happened and they say what the why did this happen on the exchange like this and I go did you read that document that explained how this particular feature of this product worked or our policy if this or that happened and then people just look oh no like like something was surprised. Well, Binance had a policy for how they marked their um margin positions if you were using uh cross collateral, right? So, I use some stable coin to margin a position where you know that stable coin is not the base currency. And because they were marking specifically Ethe stable coins to their own market which is less liquid than the global market on curve, somebody exploited that and they were able to dump a small amount of money relative to the size of the liquidation it caused which basically caused cascading liquidations on on Binance uh on sort of these margin currencies. And because of the system that they employed, uh, number one, market makers had to derisk and remove liquidity from the markets. [clears throat] Binance is forced liquidating a bunch of people at the same time. So there's not a lot of liquidity in the markets. And to top it off, they had an tech issue with their their API. So people couldn't see their positions, couldn't trade. And so you basically had this riskoff event where all coins went down, you know, 85, 90, 90%. A lot of clients were levered or they had uh delta neutral positions meaning one long and one short on Binance or another venue and they they lost money. A lot of these looping strategies that people were doing on DeFi protocols which basically had these like you know leverage positions upon leverage positions uh in these uh protocols those were also affected because the mark prices of the underlying collateral went down so quickly they got impacted. And so you saw a lot of these um lending protocols uh suffer some catastrophic failures and you know went out of business. And so you had traders overleveraged traders go out of business. You had marketing firms who didn't understand how these things worked on the exchange. You know they suffered massive losses and so you have this massive removal of liquidity from the crypto markets and that obviously adversely affected a lot of altcoins. >> And now understanding this what does this now mean to me? To me, this says opportunity. The big money, which is ready to pull the trigger, is now unsure because of what exactly happened here. Maybe we do dip lower. Maybe maybe the confidence in the market is still shook and we need either a time correction or a price correction to get that capitulation moment and have us moving up farther. But when there's blood in the streets, when the market hasn't realized something that you realize, to me, that is the time to increase or take out the position. Give me your thoughts down below what you think. Seriously, what do you think? Responding to as many as I can.
