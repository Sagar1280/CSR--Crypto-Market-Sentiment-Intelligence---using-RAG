I think now \nwhat most people don't understand is they don't   understand how significant this breakout actually \nis. It looks like it's just a small breakout. But   I'm going to show you why this breakout is so \nsignificant. Then it's probably a good time to   just reiterate what my thesis is and where we're \ngoing. What my exact prediction is of where we're   going from here. Then I'm going to show you \nbecause where we're going is pretty bullish.   I'm going to show you some trades that I've been \ntaking and some setups that I've been taking. I   think I'm going to start trading a lot more on \nthe show because I'm starting to take a whole lot   of trades and the community's been saying, \"Well, \nlook, share your trades, share your trades.\" Now,   usually I share the trades in Front Runners, but \nI'm actually going to start making some trades   on the show today. So, today we are looking at \nthis breakout, why it's so significant. We are   going to look at my exact prediction for what's \ngoing to happen next. I'm going to show you all   the hurdles and I'm also going to take some \ntrades with you live today on the show. So,   big show today. Nice to be back. Nice to have \na bullish green day on the bubbles. I mean,   when was the last time that we woke up to a \nday like this? Let's celebrate this day, guys.   Let's celebrate this day together. I think we \ndeserve it. Let's get the show on the road, guys. You know, I can't explain to you how hard it \nis making crypto content when the markets don't   move. Then finally, when you and we still make \ncontent each and every single day regardless of   whether the markets move or don't move, we're here \nbecause we believe that consistency is integrity.   We believe that consistency is a superpower. So \nwhereas most other people have left, we're here   and we're making content every single day. But \nthen when you get a day like today and everything   starts running again and it's not about the fact \nthat it's running. The fact that it's running,   great. That's one thing. But the thing is that \nwe've had this breakout and this breakout is a   super important breakout. I'm going to show you \nwhy it's a super important breakout in one second.   All I need you to do before I show you that, \nplease help me and smash that like button. I   know it's a small thing that I ask of you guys to \nlike and subscribe to the channel, but it really   makes a massive difference to us. You know, you \nget these shows for free. We work really hard   and all we ask for is just smash the like button. \nTakes you one second and it really helps us get   distribution and it makes our community better \nso we have more people in the chat. Speaking of   people in the chat, I see everybody. I see Hobby \nHorizons. I went to pee earlier and someone said   he also went. Alex said I'm going to read what \nAlex said. Shaki I see here, Glen Goldberg. Glen   Goldberg I see you everywhere guys. Thanks for \nbeing here. You guys are amazing. You guys are   the ones that have stuck with us through the bull \nmarket, the bear market, the sideways market,   and we're still here together. 247 Terminal is the \nbest. I agree. It's really a very powerful tool. Anyway, let's talk about the breakout. Enough of \nthe niceties. Let's talk about this breakout and   why I'm so excited about the breakout. When you \nlook at it at a numbers value, not so big. I mean,   it's 92 to 95. That's not a breakout that you want \nto be excited about. But let me show you what the   areas of excitement are for me. I mentioned \nto you yesterday when we were on the show,   I mentioned to you that if we get through this \nline, we are back in the upward channel. Yesterday   when we were on the show, we were trying to break \nthrough this line and we eventually crossed into   this line and we closed in this upward channel \nthat we've been in since the beginning of 2022   or mid 2022. We had lost this channel and losing \nthis channel was quite a significant loss of a   channel because then you know you're in this empty \nspace over here and then you're only reliant on   these levels as to where you're going to go next \nin the charts. The second thing which is super   important is remember I said to you that there \nwas this long area of support and resistance,   very long and very significant area of support \nand resistance which was at around the 94,000,   95,000 level. That was significant resistance; \nit was one of the longest support resistance   points on the charts and we've now broken \nthrough that point. But not only did we break   through that point, we closed above that point \nand not only have we closed above that point,   we're now trading significantly above it. We're \nnow at 95,500. This was quite a big resistance   point on the charts. Every time in the last couple \nof weeks when we've been fighting, we've been   fighting that resistance point. We got knocked \ndown in that resistance point. We got knocked   down at that resistance point. It looks like \nwe're finally putting all this upward pressure   and actually getting above this resistance \npoint. We also broke an ascending triangle   pattern. For those of you who don't know what an \nascending triangle pattern looks like, that is an   ascending triangle pattern. Usually when you break \nout, it's quite a significant breakout. We broke   the momentum. We broke the sentiment. The Fear \nand Greed has gone from fear into neutral. Now,   super important that you understand why this is so \nimportant, right? Because in the past, every time   that we've broken out from extreme fear and fear, \nwe usually go into greed. That means that the   market usually runs into greed. So, if you look \nat all these times over here when we're in extreme   fear and fear, when we broke out, we went back to \ngreen. When we go back to green, that means that   the markets are actually starting to run again. \nSo this breakout is a little bit more significant. When you talk about sentiment, this is probably \nmeasuring a very broad market sentiment. So what   I like to do is I don't look at the sentiment \nbecause sentiment is measured by sentiment,   tweets, etc. I like to look at the data that \ndrives the sentiment. Now, here I have a little   bit of a secret weapon tool. It's called Coin \nMarket Manager. What Coin Market Manager does is   it actually has got the best Hyperliquid tracker. \nThe reason I like Hyperliquid is because that's   where the whales are trading decentralized \nperpetuals, right? What these guys have done   is they've broken down the cohorts basically \nto show the shrimps. These are the small guys   and then the fish and the dolphins and the apex \npredators and they show you what each cohort,   whether they long, short, bullish or indecisive. \nSo, when I look at the Fear and Greed indicator,   this is like a broad market. Are you bullish? Are \nyou bearish? It's almost like comparing a poll   to PolyMarket. Right? So in a poll, you're just \nbasically asking people, hey, bullish, bearish,   you may be looking at people's tweets, etc. But \nthen you look at where they put their money,   where they putting their money. So I can \ntell you, look, I'm bullish, but then I'm   not putting my money down. Then am I really \nthat bullish? No, then I'm not that bullish.   What's going on here is that this is showing \nyou where the Hyperliquid whales are putting   down their money. Now the good thing is that \nwhen you look at the whales or all the cohorts,   all the cohorts are pretty much greener. \nIn other words, what's happened recently   has changed the sentiment to such an extent that \nall the cohorts and especially the big cohorts,   the money printers, the smart money, when you \nstart looking at the really big cohorts except   for the Leviathan, which is the biggest \ncohort, every single other one of these   is positioned bullishly. So that means that people \nare putting their money where their mouth is. The next thing that has changed is that the RSI \nis back over 45. Now, that's not a, you may say,   okay, well, that's just RSIs and it's just \nchart levels, but this is a very significant   chart level. The reason why this is a very \nsignificant chart level is because every   time in a bull market, the RSI stays above 45. \nGenerally, when the RSI breaks below 45, that   takes us into a bear market. You can see that over \nhere we went below and that took us into a bear   market. You can see it over here when we're in \nthe bear market. You can see it in 2021, we went   below 45 and we were in the bear market. I said \nto you that if we break down below the 45, then   I will have to admit that we're one step closer to \nbeing in a bear market. However, in bear markets,   the RSI doesn't break above 45 again, except for \nonce, right? So, basically, except for once here,   you can see that once we broke below, the next \ntime we broke above, it was back into the bull   market. Here, once we broke below, the next time \nwe broke above, it was back in the bull market.   Here, we had one fake out in 2021, but then we \nwent straight back into the bear market. We're now   coming back above the 45 on the RSIs, which tells \nme that we may still be in a bull market. The next   thing that I want to look at is I want to look \nat the ETHBTC chart because that shows me where   we are when it comes to altcoins versus Bitcoin. \nHere you can see that we're actually up against   some big resistance here. So, this is the chart of \nETHBTC. What you can see is that we are currently   at this point over here where we're just about \nto test this thing. This is quite a big decision   point. So in general, this is a very, very big \nand very significant breakout. It's not just price   going up $25,000 or $5,000. We've broken lots of \nkey levels and those breaks of lots of key levels   we've been waiting for a long time. We've been \ncalling it for a long time and it's happened. Now I want to analyze the pump by looking at \nthe on-chain data. So the first thing that you   need to look at here is you need to say what's \ndriving this and what's driving this is that this   is driven by spot and not by perpetuals. Good. \nBecause that means real buyers are coming in and   not just leverage Degen apes who are moving in \nand get flushed out every single time. This is   not that kind of pump. This is the kind of pump \nthat is driven by spot and that is driven by   I want to show you this chart over here. This is \nnot driven by the retail investors. This pump as   you can see the retail investors are nowhere \nnear this pump which means that this pump is   driven by spot institutional buying. The retail \ninvestors are here and you can basically see the   retail investors are nowhere near this pump. The \nretail investors also are not taking leverage into   this pump, which means that this is not one \nof those flimsy pumps that's driven by flimsy   people taking leverage. In fact, this pump is \nnot even yet driven by a short squeeze. So,   yes, a lot of shorts were actually Rekt yesterday. \nSo, you can see that about $680 million worth of   shorts were Rekt. What we're seeing here is that \nthe higher this goes, the more shorts are actually   being opened, which means that the leverage \ntraders are betting against this pump. Now,   why am I telling you this? Because if this is an \ninstitutional-driven pump and it's a pump that   lasts, and people are betting short against it, \nrest assured that very, very soon there's going to   be a short squeeze. That short squeeze is going to \ntake us very, very close, if not over the $100,000   level. You can see it. You know, you can't argue \nwith the on-chain data. The on-chain data is   basically saying, \"Listen, this pump is driven by \nspot.\" It's not driven by retail. The more we go   up, the more shorts are piling up, which can be \nreversed. When you get reversed, they get a short   squeeze. Then I look at this chart over here. \nNow, this chart shows when we get deleveraging   events. Generally, we get these what they call \ndeleveraging events before Bitcoin goes up. We've   just had a massive deleveraging event. Generally \njust after that you can see Bitcoin actually   starts to go up. So from an on-chain perspective, \nthis pump looks amazing. Absolutely amazing. So I trust this pump. I've been talking about this \npump for a long time. I've been arguing about this   pump for a long time. I basically told you guys \nthat I think that this pump will take us back   into the bull market. So I think this is a very \ngood time for me to lay out my thesis so it's very   clear to everyone. I want to show you exactly what \nI think is going to happen and exactly what I'm   doing about it. It's going to be in this video \nso we can never then argue as to whether I was   bullish or bearish. I've been bullish all along \nsaying that I think the 10th of October was a blip   and that we're in a bull market. I'm not saying \nthat with my eyes completely closed and with blind   belief. I'm going to base it on a few things for \nnow. I think from a chart structure point of view,   number one, we've broken the key level here. \nNumber two, we're back in the upward trend and the   chart is printing higher highs and higher lows, \nwhich is a very healthy chart structure. The RSI   closed above 45 and that says to me that we're \nstill in the bull market. I think to be clear,   I think that we are still in a bull market. I \ngive it a 70% chance because you can't say 100%.   70% chance that we're in a bull market, 30% \nchance that we're in a bear market. The four-year   cyclists believe that the bull market is over. I \ndon't. I believe that we will follow the business   cycle. I believe that the 10th of October did so \nmuch damage to crypto that only now the damage is   starting to be cleaned up and we're basically \ngoing into back into normal market conditions.   That's why the RSI is going back above 45. \nThat's why the market is starting to climb.   I don't see a world where the business cycle \nexpands, where traditional markets expand,   where commodities rip and go on an all-time high,   and crypto just doesn't. I don't see a world \nlike that. I cannot imagine a world where crypto,   which is the ultimate commodity store of value \nand where crypto is the ultimate technology,   doesn't run when markets run. When I \nentered this game, someone said to me,   \"Never bet against the Fed.\" I think what they \nmeant there was to say, \"Never bet against what   the government's telling you they're going to \ndo.\" Right? Especially in an age of Powell and   Trump's come out and said that well, we are in \na bull market. We're in a commodity super cycle.   Just look at what the commodities are doing. The \nstock markets are pretty much all at all-time   highs. The SPX is basically breaking out of an \nupward channel that it's been at for a long time. I don't see a world where on this backdrop \nwhere the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent   came out and basically said 2025 was the laying \nof the table, but the banquet is only going to   happen in 2026. I don't know if you guys \nsaw this, but let me play it for you here. [Video Clip: Scott Bessent on the economy] \"Categorize 2025. We had some important \nvictories, some important policy announcements,   some important movement, but I, as I've \ndescribed it, 2025 was setting the table,   and I especially on the economy, I think the \nfeast and the banquet's going to be in 2026.\" Feast. So, he's saying that the feast, \nthe banquet are going to be in 2026. But   then when I look at what Trump's saying, he's \nsaying the feast and the banquet have already   started and the results are in and the Trump \neconomic boom is officially begun. It's really   begun almost from the and the result. Yeah. \nI mean, I don't know if you saw some other   comments that he made yesterday specifically \naround Powell. Probably worth listening to. [Video Clip: Trump discussing Powell and rates] \"In the Fed, we have a real stiff in the Fed, but \nthat's for another day. But they raise rates. So,   everyone says, 'Oh, they announced great \nnumbers. It's great, great, great, and the   market goes down because they immediately \nraise rates.' No. When the market goes up,   they should lower rates. You want to see \n20% and 25%. You want to see what we can   do. We've got to go back to an old standard. \nWhen there's good news, the market should go up,   not go down. Does that make sense to \neverybody? And that's the way it...\" I mean, he's right. When there's good news, the \nmarket should go up, not down. Now, when there's   good news, we're so worried the Fed's going to \nraise interest rates that the market doesn't do   that in that way. Trump's right. You can see that \nTrump and his team and Bessent and everybody else   is on a mission and they're going to appoint their \nown Fed chair which is going to be on exactly the   same mission. I don't see a world where you \ncan bet against a technology and a commodity,   the ultimate technology and commodity combination \nin a year like that. Especially when we haven't   even tapped the real money. If you look at \ncrypto allocations and clients accounts,   if you're looking at financial advisers, \n57% of them are going to increase.   42 are going to maintain and 1% are going to \ndecrease. At the same time, we haven't even   tapped real money yet. If you think that the ETF \ninflows that we got last year were real money,   then let me break it to you in a very nice way. \nThe sovereign pension funds and the sovereign   nation states have not started allocating. They're \nthe biggest capital allocators in the world.   Even in the US, the capital allocators that have \nbeen given money to Bitcoin and to ETFs have only   given it to Bitcoin and haven't really started \nto deploy their wallets yet. They're going to   be at a 5% allocation of crypto in their \nportfolios. They've admitted it and most   of them aren't even at a half a percent. The \nbig ones haven't even started buying yet. So,   yes, we've had Harvard endowment \nand maybe one or two endowments,   but we haven't even scratched the surface yet. \nWe're probably going to do that now in 2026. So, my thesis is that there's going to be a \nbull market, but I think that there's going   to be some hurdles, short-term hurdles along \nthe way. Again, I want to be clear. My thesis,   30% chance we're in a bear market. 70% \noverwhelming chance, two and a half times   that chance we're in a bull market. When will \nI confirm that we're in a bull market? What is   the road to get to that bull market? That's the \nimportant thing here. So, I'm not blind. I know   that this is going to happen. We're not just going \nto go from today from 96,000 where we are today   all the way up to all-time highs. There's going \nto be lots of hurdles along the way and I want   to talk to you about every single one of those \nhurdles and what I plan to do in those hurdles.   The first thing is we've broken a massive hurdle \ntoday by getting over this 95,000 level. We got to   close above this and I think we will close above \nit. Then we're going to get to some other hurdle   points. We're going to get to $100,000. When \nwe get to $100,000, it's a psychological level.   It's not a chart level. It's a psychological \nlevel. When we get to the $100,000 level,   we're going to face resistance again. At that same \nlevel, there's the 50 Weekly SMA, which is one of   the key pillars that we're looking at. That's \nat 101,000. So, between 100,000 and 102,000,   we're going to struggle. So, we're going to go \nup now from now close to 100,000. When we get   to 100,000, we probably going to reject \na little bit. When we get above 100,000,   we're going to hit for me the most important level \nof all. That is the 200-day Simple Moving Average.   That's at 106,000 today. Why is it the most \nimportant line of all? Because in bear markets,   once we break below it, generally we just retest \nit. If we're in a bear market, we're going   to go down. If we're in a bull market, we're \ngoing to go up. That's the way that I see it. And so between now and 100, we'll get some \nproblems at 100. Then at 106, we're going to   face our biggest test yet. If we break above the \n106,000, the bull market is back on and 10/10 was   just a correction. If we don't and we reject off \nhere and we start going down here just like we did   in 2021 and just like we did in 2017, I'm going to \nhave to concede that we're going to be in a bear   market. For me, this is the most important level \nbecause from here to there, I think we're going   to have a run. When we get there, it's decision \ntime. When we get there, if we break through it,   we're back in the bull market. If we don't, we \ncould go into the bear market. You need to know   that. You need to be prepared for that. Right \nnow, I'm bullish. I'm bullish until we get to   between 104 and 107. Why don't I say 106 exactly? \nBecause I know that price never rejects directly   off the line. If you want to prepare, prepare \nat that point in time. So, what do I mean by   prepare? Number one, for now, I'm going long and \nI'm going long until we get to the 105, 106. At   the same time, when we get near the 105 and 106, \nI'm going to sell all the things that I said I was   going to sell if we get a bounce. I know you're \nholding tokens in your portfolio that you said if   we get a bounce, I'm going to sell those tokens. \nWell, when we break 100, start thinking of selling   those tokens. Between 104 and 107, make sure that \nyou are out of every single token that you don't   want to be holding in your portfolio. Be ruthless \nabout it. Swap them into things that you actually   want to be in. I know you're holding those tokens \n'cause I'm also holding those tokens. I've got,   for example, I've got Sonic in my portfolio. Not \nsure if I want to hold it. I'm holding it because   of the flying tulip launch, but I'm not sure \nif I want to hold it. When we get to 105, 106,   I'm going to seriously reconsider why I'm holding \nthat token. You should do exactly the same. After the 106, 107, if we break above it, make \nsure that you're only holding the tokens that   you want to be holding for the rest of the bull \nmarket, and you're not holding rats and mice,   and you're not holding junk. It feels so good. I \nlooked at my portfolio today. My portfolio is so   good. I'm holding the best tokens out there. I'll \nshow you my portfolio in another video. Cool. So,   that's my thesis. Bull market at least a bull \nmarket until 104, 105 with some resistance   at between 100 and 101. At 106, 104 to 107, \nwe're going to make a decision. If we get up,   if we fly through, bull market it is. If not, we \ngot to reconsider and we'll decide if it's the   bear market or not the bear market. That's it. \nYou've heard my thesis. What are the hurdles?   What could get in the way? Where can we expect \nshakes? Because it's not going to be a straight   lineup. The first shake that I think we can \nexpect is the Trump tariff ruling could come   as soon as today. If it comes, problem is that \nTrump set a precedent. He said that if the court   rules against him, we're toast. Look at the prices \nare running. Just look at the prices. I'm so glad   we made the show when we made the show because \nthe prices are absolutely exploding. Amazing.   The thesis is playing out exactly like \nwe told you it was going to happen.   If the Supreme Court rules against Trump today, \nmarkets are going to take a back. Markets are   going to get hit for a short term and then they're \ngoing to realize that Trump's got already a plan   B and a plan C. We could get if the Supreme \nCourt rules that Trump tariffs are illegal,   we could get an Iranian bombardment. Why? Because \nthey might play this distraction game. So just   keep your eyes open for that. The market is \npredicting that there's an Iranian attack   probably by the end of Jan. I mean just look at \nthis by 80% by the end of March. So the market   is predicting an Iranian attack. I think this \nwould be good for markets, lower oil prices. The next thing that could be a hurdle. Everyone's \nvery excited about this Clarity Act that is coming   through. Paul Atkins on CNBC says it's a very big \nweek for crypto. Well, the Congress passed and the   president signed a bill late last year that was \ncalled the Genius Act and that was really seminal.   It was the first statute that the United States \ngovernment has adopted to recognize a crypto   asset. So that was great and it helped to bring \nclarity also to stablecoins. So now comes the   next step. A good bipartisan effort by both houses \nof Congress to bring certainty to the market. Big,   big, everyone's excited about the Clarity Act \nand we need the Clarity Act to pass and they   are scrambling to get it through. But if we don't \nget it through, there is a big problem. The big   problem is that there's the midterm elections. At \nthe midterm elections, PolyMarket predicts that   there'll be a 78% chance that the Democrats will \nwin the house. When the Democrats win the House,   I think it's going to be much, much harder to get \nthis Clarity Act through. So we need to get the   Clarity Act through. Right now, PolyMarket is \nsaying that there's a 55% chance or 54% chance   that the act, the Clarity Act, will be signed \ninto law in 2026. This unlocks a lot of clarity   and therefore a lot of money by big institutions \nto come into crypto. I'm worried that they're not   going to get this done on time. I think the US \ndemocratic system works, but the US democratic   system takes a long time to do things, and I'm \nworried they're not going to get it done on time.   This might be one of the big thorns that actually \nsends the market back. Then the one thing that   is really scary and I'm keeping an eye on, and \nremember this is all up against a bullish thesis,   is this. We're at the top of the channel. \nThe SBX's had an amazing run. The SBX needs a   correction. It's going to be very hard for the SBX \nto have a correction and for Bitcoin to stay where   Bitcoin is. But for now, as I said, I'm bullish \nand I'm investing and I'm investing in old coins   that I want to hold for the next part of the cycle \nor that I'm happy to hold right into the cycle.   I did do a trade in Front Runners yesterday, \nwhich again, if you're not part of Front Runners,   I really suggest you join at this \npart of the market. There's a link   below. Sign up. If you're not happy, just \nwrite me a mail. I'll refund your money. But there's a trade that I took yesterday that \nI want you guys to listen to. I don't know if   it works. I don't know if you can actually... \nOkay. So, I can't play the voice note that I   played in Front Runners, but here's a thesis. I \nthink privacy money is the biggest trade of 2026   and when you look at the bubbles and you look at \nwhat tokens have moved in 2026, just look at the   last week. I mean Dash, Monero, and Zcash are the \nbiggest movers basically of the year. Look at the   one month privacy coin. Zcash got hit because of \nthe Monero, you know because of the developers   walked out and when the developers walked out \npeople divested from Zcash and they invested   into Monero. So right now there's a three-step \ntrade that's probably worth taking. The first   step is I think Zcash; I think that private money \nis going to be the biggest narrative of 2026 and I   think you need to be invested into private money \nand therefore you need to make a choice whether   you want to invest into Zcash or Monero. Tomorrow \nI'm going to drop a show on Crypto Insider which   tells you which one I invest in and why. The \nthing here is if you're going to buy Zcash,   you also should be buying NEAR. The reason \nwhy you want to buy NEAR is because NEAR has   got this thing called NEAR Intents. That's \nwhat NEAR Intents is. It looks like a DEX,   but effectively what it allows you to do \nis swap from private money to non-private   money. In other words, from Zcash, which is \nprivate money, to non-private money on-chain,   which means that you bypass the whole need to \nget onto an exchange and reveal your KYC. Now,   if you're trading privacy coins, you can't then \ngo onto a KYC exchange and then back onto it   because then Fefe is in the thing here. You see, \nI knew that Fefe actually comes here to get his   alpha. I knew he comes to get his alpha. \nYou should tell him to lay out his thesis   as well as I've laid out my thesis because \nhere a lot of his people are quite confused. Anyway, going back to the alpha, what happens \nhere is that NEAR Intents is right now the hub   where people trade from Zcash into ETH and other \ntokens, Solana, etc., and back into privacy coin.   This is almost like the ultimate money laundering \noperation because you don't actually have to go   through... I didn't did I just say that this is \nthe ultimate money laundering operation? Because   you are trading from privacy to non-privacy \non-chain without a centralized intermediary. So   here's the three-step trade, the two-step trade. \nNumber one, buy Zcash and just hold Zcash in your   portfolio. But number two, buy NEAR and hold \nNEAR in your portfolio. Because if Zcash runs,   NEAR is also going to run. Look at the chart of \nNEAR. It hasn't done anything yet. When Zcash   starts to run and people realize how powerful \nNEAR Intents actually is, then this chart is going   to turn. You can see it's just started turning, \nright? You can see and maybe it's even breaking a   small cup and handle formation over here. Okay, so \nthe traders, step one and two, you don't need to   have guts for. Step three, you need to have guts \nfor. Step three, short Monero if you're scared of   market movements. I'm not shorting Monero yet. \nIn fact, I've got quite a long Monero position. So, I want to take that trade actually with you \nguys. So, I loaded an account on Bybit with um I   think this account has got, let me just open the \nsub-account. Give me one second. Let's just get   a sub-account here. Um, do we have margin? Yeah. \nYes, we do. Okay. So, I loaded this account. I've   got 50 grand in this account. We're going to start \ntogether. You can put five grand, 10 grand, or   whatever you want. You can do this on Bybit or on \nBlofin. We'll leave links below with either of the   exchanges. If you open an account and you're the \nfirst 100 people to open account, you get a free   $1,000 trade. But you got to do it today and you \ngot to be the first 100. Now, what I'm going to do   here is I'm going to go long NEAR and I'm going to \ngo long Zcash. That's the first part of my trade.   I'm going to put I'm not going to go crazy margin. \nI'm not going to go crazy leverage. I'm buying   this to hold this for a couple of months. I'm \ngoing to take a $20,000 notional position, which   is 10,000 NEAR. Actually, make it 11,000 just \nso we know we've taken a notional position. I'm   going to do this actually on 5x leverage because \nI don't want to go crazy leverage. Oh man, I've   just been logged out. Oh man, hold on a second. \nLet me try and log back in. Can't believe they   logged me out right in the middle of the show. \nThey logged me out. It's quite rude. It's rude.   They shouldn't do that. I mean, somebody phoned \nBybit. Okay, I know. I know why that happened.   It's because of the VPN stuff. But anyway, let's \nbecause you know when you walk into the office,   the VPN gets turned off. Let's quickly have a \nlook here. I have to authenticate this account. Okay, so forgive me. I wanted to put through these \ntrades with you guys. I want to actually build   this account together. So, open account on Bybit \nor Blofin. I'm going to open an account on both.   For both of them, you get your first $1,000 free \ntrade if you were one of the first hundred. So,   here we go. Let's just quickly let \nme just get into a sub-account here.   Uh, okay. Here we go. Okay, I'm in the \nsub-account. So, and let me try and just get into   trades, futures trading. Here we go. Okay, so I'm \nback in the account. I've got $50,000 of margin in   this account. You can trade with me. I'm going \nto buy some and remember and I'm buying this,   I'm not buying this for one week or two weeks. \nThese are not that trade. This is stuff that I'm   holding because I really think it's going to do \nwell. I'm going to buy myself 11,000 of these. Um   11,000 of these. There we go. I'm going to do it \non a 5x leverage. I'm not going to do 10x. I think   10x is a bit aggressive. Um over there. I'm buying \nthat. I'm going to just buy that at market. I'm   not going to mess around for 2 cents. I'm buying \nthis because I really think it's going to work.   I'm going to buy myself another $20,000 of Zcash. \nSo the Zcash. Now remember, I'm not buying this to   trade this to exit tomorrow. So, that's not the \nthese are trades that we're going into the next   part of the cycle with, right? Here I'm going \nto buy $20,000 worth of that as well, which is   50 units. I'm going to buy it at 420. I'm buying \nthis. The reason why I'm buying I'm also going to   buy this at 5x. The reason why I'm buying Zcash \nis because Zcash was hit hard by the news that   developers were walking out. But in the meantime, \nthe developers just were moving to a shell which   was a better shell than the one they were in. \nOkay, so we've got those two positions open. Okay, the next position which I'm actually \ntaking and again I'm not buying these. If they   go down 10% tomorrow, don't come and complain \nbecause that's not why we're actually buying   these things. The next one that I'm buying is \nLighter. Why? Because Lighter is one of these   tokens that I think is going to do really well, \nbut the airdrop guys have been farming it. So I   want to scale into Lighter position. I'm not \nready to take the full Lighter position. So   I'm going to take half of my Lighter position \nalso at 5x leverage and I'm going to go long.   So, I've got three positions that are basically \nopen now. I've got Zcash, I've got NEAR because   I believe in the Zcash protocol, and I've got \nLighter because I believe in the Perps protocol,   and I think that Lighter hasn't had a run. Those \nare the three trades that I've basically open.   Now, you can open the same or similar trades. \nJust go to and the link below, sign up for Bybit,   sign up for Blofin. Blofin is good if you don't \nwant to do KYC. If you're in a country that Bybit   doesn't surface, Bybit is a full exchange. \nFor both of them, you get the $50 voucher,   which you can open into a $1,000 leverage position \nif you do it today. And we should probably put in   the Front Runners link because there's a lot of \ntrades actually going on. I know the guys caught   the KARRAT trade, which was an amazing trade in \nFront Runners as well, which was fantastic. Okay,   so that's it. Listen, you've heard my thesis. \nYou've heard why I'm so bullish. As I'm so   bullish, the price has gone up another $1,000. \nBitcoin is now trading at 96,500. We're so back,   baby. We're so back. I'm very excited to be here \nfor the first time in a while. I'll see you guys   again tomorrow. Remember, tomorrow there's \na video dropping about Zcash versus Monero,   the ultimate ultimate ultimate showdown. See you \ntomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends.",
