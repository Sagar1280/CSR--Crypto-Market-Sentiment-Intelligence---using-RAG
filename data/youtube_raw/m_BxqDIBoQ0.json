  "transcript": "Welcome to FUD and FOMO. Crypto \nheadlines high and low. Markets move,   emotions flow. It's the F and FOMO show. Yes. Yes, it is the FUD and FOMO show. Was anyone \nexpecting that? I'd forgotten about the the reggae   intro theme over there. We really playing around \nwith our genres of music between that and our live   stream team on Monday had some experimentation in \nterms of the best intro music for this and they   settled on that. So to end a Friday off listen \nI I people push back on it but I said hiring a   house reggae band to just be here and jamming in \nthe office, you know, five days a week. I knew it   was I knew it was money well spent and I stand \nby that. I think you were right. I think you   were right on that. Sorry for the push back guy. \nThat's that's that's all right. I know everyone   I know some people, you know, it's a bare market \nand stuff, but every crypto channel should have   its own in-house reggae band. And I think I've \njust proved that. Welcome every FOMO. People   are watching the stream. It's like, what the hell \nhappened here? Coinb is going live on a Friday on   the main channel with this goddamn reggae music. \nWhat is FUD and FOMO? Exactly. Exactly. Well,   this is FUD and FOMO. Everyone, welcome. This \nis a new live stream format uh that we thought   we'd play around with. Um longtime viewers of the \nCoin Bureau may be aware that we already do a live   stream news show on Mondays. Um but you know, we \nthought it's a bit of a long seven days is a long   time to leave you guys without a glimpse of us \nlive. So, we thought we'd try something a little   different for Fridays. This is going to be a lot \nless sort of structured, a bit more chilled, a bit   more of a kind of meandering discussion really \nabout some of the stuff that's been going on uh   in crypto over the last week. Um so please do let \nus know in the comments whether you are whether   you like this new Friday live stream um or whether \nit's just uh interrupting you from getting out of   work and going to the pub. Um but yeah, do keep us \nposted on what you think. I'm joined of course by   uh Lewis. Hello Lewis. Good to see you. Thank you \nvery much. You're in the uh in the jungly coin   screen there. It's got a it's a green screen, \nright? It's a green screen set up. Oh, it's a   green screen. Oh, sorry. It's actually a new tech \nnew technology. Uh it's a green screen where if   you put your hand close enough to it, it actually \nmoves what's what the green screen is presenting.   So, it's really cool. New tech. New tech. Nano \nnano green screen technology. Actually, AI AI.   It's wild. Again, money well spent. You know, I \nknew I knew it was worth it. I knew it was worth   it. Yeah. Um, meanwhile, we've also got Nick um \nin his in his It looks like an Airbnb there. But,   uh, how are you doing, Nick? It's a VIP pad, man. \nUh, it's cool, man. I'm cool. Enjoying your Nick   crypto in the background. Um, you know, the Airbnb \nhost must have known that you were coming. So,   they set it up exactly. I personalized it for me. \nIt's a special service on Airbnb. Perfect. I like   the uh I like the slightly sleazy purple light as \nwell. I'm here for that. That's brilliant. That's   brilliant. That's Friday vibes, you know, not red, \nnot green, just just sleas. Brilliant. Okay. Uh   so folks, um today we are we're talking about \na few things. We're going to be talking about   um some interesting stuff happening with Ethereum \nat the moment. We're also going to be talking   about privacy and the perpetas. Um both of which, \nas you've probably noticed, uh there's been quite   a lot going on there as well. But also, \nwe're kind of looking ahead because today,   believe it or not, is a pretty consequential \nday for not just the crypto market, but   markets in general because we have two big uh big \nannouncements, big things coming up, if you like,   um, a little later on today. Um, so we thought \nwe'd dive into that. Nick, can you talk us through   the first of these things that we that we need to \nbe aware of that's happening a little later on?   So literally within tminus 26 minutes we've \ngot the first NFP employment numbers for the   year 2026. Uh so these are coming in uh 73,000 \nis the expected number. So that's a number to   watch guys. Above or below expectations it will \ndetermine how the markets move because this will   of course inform the Fed rate decision uh in terms \nof January. Now, in terms of expectations for the   Fed, uh the interest rate cut um expectations \nfor January, it's about 80% chance of no cut,   but that could very quickly change if the numbers \nare to the downside and it looks as if the labor   market risks are uh there are labor market risks. \nAnd if you recall back to the FOMC minutes from   last week, it was revealed again that uh the Fed \nis now more worried about the downside risks to   employment than inflation. So this will be a big \ndeterminant factor in terms of how uh markets   react um and how the the Fed thinking goes into \nthe next FOMC. So that's coming out now and I'd   say in 25 minutes. Okay. So non-farm payrolls and \nuh yeah as you said this is kind of a a bit of a   focus for the Fed now. They're concentrating more \non uh they're more worried about employment than   they are about inflation. Yeah, exactly. Um \nI think that inflation is still above target,   right? Um but I think that now they're worried \nabout employment and uh I think also to the effect   that the inflation itself hasn't been that badly \nimpact impacted by tariffs which many people had   worried about earlier last year. Uh so I think \nthat and then of course there's Trump that's   hot on their heels. So they're worried about any \nsort of hiccups in the in the jobs market. Yeah.   Do you guys remember that time? It's only a few \nyears ago now when uh when we us, you know, when   we would do crypto streams or whatever or we do \ncrypto videos and we we never seem to worry about   things like non-farm payrolls or Fed interest rate \ndecisions and then a while back everything changed   and now we all have to watch data like this like \na hawk. It was it was much more fun just crazy   coins popping off, right? The concept of crypto \nbros sitting over there watching the listening to   the every single word of the old fiat boomer as he \ndetermined the future of the magic internet money.   How far? Satoshi w what does he think of this? You \nknow, all these guys standing around waiting to   see what and passing the language the feds speak \nof Jerome and co or what tie Jerome Powell is is   wearing, what color and then that will determine \nwhat size before this the meeting itself like   people are actually bet and now they've got \nyou've got prediction markets that are actually   like going into the drilling into the details not \njust of the the actual interest rate decision but   in terms of words that are mentioned in these in \nthese actual FOMC um you um presentations and and   briefings. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They they bet on \non pretty much everything. Um I even saw a new   thing that was coming out where it's like you can \ncreate your own prediction markets, but I don't   know how that would even work because, you know, \nthat seems like you could just create your own   uh bets on things that you know what you're the \noutcome's going to be. I put a prediction on the   I put a prediction on Lewis taking his hat off and \nduring the stream and insider trade that Lewis.   Yeah. I mean the the the big thing with these \nprediction markets is is just that I mean they're   so they're so obviously being used for insider \ntrading, aren't they? I mean we got these examples   of sort of massive bets from newly created wallets \nbeing placed right before something consequential   happens that only How about last year? How about \nlast year? the example of the uh green dildos on   the basketball court and the guy who was caught. \nThat's how far we've come and that's that's the   future of prediction markets. People rigging um \nbut that's it's not only um to not lose track of   the convers that's happening today. It's obviously \nthere's NFP numbers which are now coming in like   12 like 22 minutes but there's another big \nevent today as well. Right. There is. Yeah.   So you mentioned tariffs a little earlier uh Nick \nand obviously they were the kind of big economic   story of last year um and had a huge effect on \nthe crypto market uh as much as anything else   but uh they those tariffs were challenged in \nthe Supreme Court um because uh there was an   argument made that um Trump wasn't actually able \nto act kind of unilaterally like he did. Um so the   tariffs were challenged and the Supreme Court is \nactually delivering its ruling on that challenge   on that particular case later today as well. In \nfact I think uh within the next hour or so. Um   and what this means is that there is a possibility \num that they will rule that the tariffs are were   were not lawful or you know not legal um and \ntherefore need to be rolled back which could   and I do underline this is you know this is one \nof several possible scenarios but it it could mean   um that the administration has to pay the tariffs \nback uh to all those you know American companies   that have paid them um which is of course \nhundreds of billions of dollars already.   Um so there is there is quite a lot on the line \nhere. Should mention though that there are there   is more than one outcome or two outcomes. It's not \nbinary. There's a few other options here. One is   that the Supreme Court rules that um on you know \nthe more optimistic side they say okay well all   future tariffs so essentially what's already \nbeen collected is not going to be refunded.   So the president can't implement any more new \nfuture tariffs and they won't be applicable   going forward. So retroactively uh they won't \ngo retroactively. And then also there's another   option where they say certain tariffs could be \nstill applied if assuming they fall under the   wrapper of national security threats and that's \nthe ones that relate to the fentinel that's   potentially Mexico and Canada. So that's another \npotential option. So there's at least you know   four different rulings that could happen here and \nthree that are kind of like medium ground. Well,   two that are on medium ground and one that \nis basically complete uh refunding of all   the tariffs, striking it all down and then the \nother two in the middle. So, it will be really   interesting to see what happens. I think the main \nthing people in terms of the markets, if it is a   complete strike down and the the government will \nhave to refund those tariffs, that's going to be   a massive risk on move for the markets because \nit's going to be fiscal stimulus. uh but then you   know potentially rates could uh shoot up because \nof concerns around the fiscal uh fiscal position   of the US government because now they've lost \nthose tariff revenues. So it will definitely be   something to watch. I think that's within at least \nmaybe an hour it will come out. Yeah. And in fact   if the uh if the court does strike them down then \nthe White House um is expected to immediately try   and reimpose them um but just using different \nlegal authorities apparently as well. So   um it might just be that it's a case of okay you \nsay you can't do them well we're doing them under   this particular section or whatever it is um \nwhich would in itself probably trigger another   legal challenge. So although I guess there's a \nthere's a sense that we might get some kind of   closure on this, actually what it likely means is \nwe could just be a whole load more um a whole load   more deliberation which I guess probably accounts \namounts to a lot more uncertainty in the long run.   Yeah, I was that's what I was thinking. I for \nsome reason I just don't think they're going   to come to a hard decision on it today. And \nit did say like today's like decision day for   handing down opinions. Does that mean that it's \nliterally like they have to uh you know come up   with a with a legit decision right now? Like one \nof those four decisions or is it like today is the   day that's the final decision day on what could \npossibly happen in like like in the future? like   they need to come up with their mind of like of \nthose four different you know things and then be   like these are the options and we'll we'll figure \nout the op we'll figure out like what what's what   you actually decide later down the road. Yeah. \nThere always seems to be something like that   that that that ends up happening like it it just \nfrom in the government from what I've seen you   know. Yeah. Like it it would be really shocking \nto me if today if if all of the sudden someone you   like they just came out, oh hey, yeah, you have to \nrepay all of these like and like that was that was   the decision, they come out with it like today. I \ndon't know. It would I don't think they're going   to come out with that ever to be honest. It's \njust like it's it's too it's that's like the most   extreme case, right? And I think like typically \nit's more in the middle of like where where things   end up. But I don't know, that's just that's \njust me when it comes to these these tariffs.   I feel like it's been such a long time since we \nstarted talking about tariffs, you know? It's   like a lot of people are like, \"All right, like \neven if even if there is a decision on it, it's   like it's like how many people are going to be so \nemotionally caught up in it to make huge decisions   based off of it at this point.\" Now, also like \nif this happened, you know, like originally,   then it's like, oh man, like we're all caught up \nin it, right? But now it's like, dude, it's been   like a long time. So, yeah, it's like, okay. Oh, \nyeah. Okay, whatever. I guess there's a sense as   well that a lot of people are sort of like, we've \nmoved past tariffs. Like, tariffs, what tariffs?   Like, you know, what's happening with Venezuela? \nWhat what's happening with Greenland? You know,   are you guys still talking about tariffs? Why why \nare we even talking? That's next week's problem,   guys. But um it's time for a quick we'll come \nback with the next topic top topic in a bit,   but I think it's time for a shout out for \nour brand sponsor. Right. It is indeed. Hey,   I want to give a big shout out to the sponsors \nof this live stream, Binance. Now, if you need   an exchange that has loads of trading pairs, loads \nof liquidity, and a fantastic interface to boot,   then Binance is the place to go. And if you sign \nup using this QR code, you're not only eligible   for up to $600 in signup bonuses, but you'll also \nget a 20% trading fee discount for life. Yes,   that is for life. So, a big thanks to Binance for \nsponsoring this stream. And speaking of which,   let's get back to it. There we are. I was reading \nthe comments and and one of them said like, \"Work,   aren't we all in crypto? And and it's like, well, \nyeah, we are, but we're probably going to have to   get jobs pretty soon. I mean, although now I I \nheard McDonald's stopped taking in people that   were crypto bros, so we might really be screwed \nat that point. I I think I think if McDonald's   haven't put a hard cap on on Crypto Bros by now, \nthey they really have not been paying attention.   Um, so yeah, I think we we may all have to try \nBurger King instead. Um, okay. Let's let's move   on. We were talking about tariffs. Um, so we're \ngoing to see what happens there. But, uh, yeah,   I kind of think it's probably going to be um quite \nmessy, but um, I wanted to also talk briefly about   some good news cryptoreated and actually some good \nnews for ETH. And I say this as an ETH holder, so   you know, make of that what you will, but actually \nlike things are things are kind of looking up   for Ethereum at the moment. The Fisaka upgrade \nwent ahead last year. We've got Glamsterdam, the   wonderfully named Glamsterdam coming up soon uh as \nwell. Um but uh we've there's also the recent news   that Ethereum's validator exit queue has dropped \nto zero. Now I just want to share my screen   uh with you guys here. Uh there we are. Validated \nQ. So no validators are leaving essentially. Is   that what that means? Uh yes. So let me bring \nthis up. So yeah, basically um there but there's   still a long queue uh of people wanting to \nenter, people wanting to stake their ETH,   but the uh ETH unstaking um has basically come \nto an end. Now this was a kind of big hangover   um something that was hanging over ETH uh you \nknow especially when these um ETFs launched um   that the validator exit queue was looking pretty \nlong and a lot of people is this like is this like   when people you know uh originally in I think 2022 \nuh started staking all of their ETH and they have   to they had to stake it for a certain number of \nyears and then like from that point and then like   as they continued to stake it like you know 2023 \nand there was a certain time that you had to stake   it and now it's no I think that's is different I \nthink that you validated exits or most um proof   of stake networks have um an exit queue of some \ndescription right such that you have an orderly   change in the validator set and it's not dropped \nimmediately so there's generally queue it up and   then there's an unstaking period but I think \nin the case of ETH when you have a spike in the   validator exit Q it slows down the unstenability \nso I think in this case the fact that it's dropped   towards zero means that it's it's good news to the \nextent that not many people who are staking are   deciding to unstake. And in fact, it's not just \nthe fact that less people are choosing to unstake,   but also the fact that there's more staking taking \nplace, right? Because we've got upcoming ETFs that   BitMine has just been staking all of its all \nof its ETH regularly and a few other DATs as   well. So, um this is great news for the Ethereum \nnetwork. Yeah, there was also a bit of a change   to the way staking worked as well. This is the um \nthese are ETF inflows for for ETH and I I want to   talk about these in a minute but there was also \na change to um the dynamics if you like of ETH   staking as well because it wasn't I think I forget \nwhich recent upgrade it was whether it was Fusaka   or the one we had before that but basically \nchanged so it used to be that the maximum you   could stake was 32 ETH um and that maximum was \nmassively increased so you know it so I think   there was a lot of withdrawing in kind of restake \nwith with a with a higher maximum Denun right I   think that was the one in March last yeah I think \nyeah I think you're right I think you're right   it was Denun so the dynamics around ETH staking \nhave changed a lot so obviously a lot of people I   think who were um you know having to run multiple \nvalidators because you know they had an absolute   absolute ton of ETH that they got very cheap um \nwere probably consolidating those validators but   um just looking back at that at that earlier \nscreen active valid validators 973,646. I mean that is the sort of decentralization that \nmost most others would would kill for. Um but also   having a look at these uh ETF flows I think \nas well because there's something interesting   here. If you look at the top there um there are \nonly two ETH staking ETFs currently live. Both   of which are operated by uh run by Grayscale. \nUm but if you see here all of these other ones   including of course Black Rockcks um are pending \non staking as well. So eventually uh these you   know if staking is approved for these ETFs which \nyou I I imagine is something of a formality   um the amount of staked ETH is going to climb \neven more. Right. Yeah exactly. I mean that's   if the if many of these ETFs are going to try to \nbe staking ETFs. think that they allowed to I I   guess the question is is it is it appealing \nenough and that the mechanics of how that   um that staking reward is given back to the users \num and um you know if there's still appeal for   people filing for staking ETFs but uh as much ETH \nthat is staked in that obviously is beneficial for   the network uh it secures the network um well \nit secures the network in the short term but I   guess the the other angle some people could take \nis like does this mean because the proof ofstake   network has more it's more susceptible to control \nvia resources in terms of stake control. So if   Black Rockck has most of the power of the stake \nand Bitmine, you know, it's that is a question,   but for the short term, it's bullish. I wonder if \nthe rewards get back to the person that is to the   retail person that is investing into the ETF like \na dividend. Yeah, there should be uh there should   be but I think that there's either that or the in \nor there's a prorate um it's what's the term when   it compounds it compounds the the interest or the \nstaking and rewards themselves compounds in the   price so they don't pay it out it just increases \nin the actual value of the ETF so um yeah I   forgot the exact term for that but that could be \nanother option instead of paying out dividends is   basically the value of your your ETH per that you \nhold per share goes up mm I wonder. Uh well, we'll   figure that out once it becomes live. Fingers \ncrossed. Yeah, it's I think it's big news though   because and and I think this this thing from the \nblock makes it kind of clear, you know, this is   this is big institutional news as well because \ninstitutions obviously they they love yield. Yield   is a really important important consideration for \nthem. And Nick, you mentioned Bitmine as well.   obviously you know the DATs and and Bitmine uh \nEthzilla and others are are staking theirs too. So   but it really points I think towards an increase \nin just you know institutional kind of validation   for Ethereum if you like. Um yeah and I mean I you \nknow that that kind of seems to be the way it's   going now. Yeah, it seems to be I mean I think \nthat uh it's the next one down the stack from   Bitcoin. If institutions are starting to to move \ninto alts, that's the first place to watch the   rotation from Bitcoin to ETH and therefore the you \nknow ETH BTC ratio. Yeah. Yeah. And institutions   don't don't look for a 5,000% yield like the \ncrypto dgens do. You know, they'll be okay with   like 4% or 5%. So you mean you you mean Lewis that \nthe institutions aren't going to be aren't going   to be sitting up late into the night farming DeFi \nyield farming going across various protocols to   get I don't think they're going to be doing that. \nSo Ethereum is is the logical choice. Yeah. I I   like the idea of some of someone paying like a \nGen Z intern at Black Rockck just to sit up late   into the night just be like just go just go hunt \nyield. Here's here's 5 billion USDC. Just just go   and farm that and it's gone. Then black rock black \nrock suddenly crumbles. Um okay. So I mean good   news for yeah good news for Ethereum and I think \nlike I mean it does kind of it does kind of also   I think point the point in the direction of travel \nfor the for the crypto space as a whole. I think   because like do either of you know when those are \nsupposed to come out by the way like the staking   for the different ETFs. I can't remember when \nthey're going to be approved. I think I I can't   there was some I think there was some sort of \ndelay on on why exactly it was happening. I mean   it may be tied up with the innovation exemption um \nwhich the SEC is is is putting into place. I mean,   supposedly later this month, which, you know, \ngiven that we're given that we're almost 10   days into the month, you know, it must be fairly \nclose, which is obviously going to make all um all   crypto stuff kind of legal in the US for a period \nof time. So, it may just be a case of waiting for   that innovation uh exemption to go live. Um, and \nthen we'll see all those uh all those spot ETH   ETFs tick over into into staking, which like I say \nshould should mean that validator queue, you know,   for entry gets a lot longer. Yeah. Okay, that is \nuh that is the latest happening with Ethereum. Um,   thanks for hearing me out on that one guys. Um, \nso we should also talk about two of the hottest   sectors uh in the market at the moment and those \nare privacy and perexes. Now, I want to start with   privacy because we've had some interesting news \nrecently. Zcash, obviously one of the massive   performers of last year. Um, uh, I don't I can't \nremember whether either of you guys have, uh,   Ze in your portfolios, but if you do, it's kind of \nbeen an an interesting week, right? An interesting   few days. Yeah, I do hold a bit of Ze. It has been \na crazy few days. Um, I think that it was, you   know, it was beginning started the year off with \na nice little pump. uh everyone was getting on   board the privacy meta again and then we got this \nshock news at the beginning of this week uh that   the team the entire team at Electric Coin Company \nwhich is the developer behind Zcash had resigned   due to um basically irre irreconcilable diff \ndifferences with relation to the board members   over strategic matters etc. Um and obviously this \nled to a complete collapse in the price of Ze. Uh   but it was later you know later it turned out that \nit wasn't as bad as many had thought because they   was said that the team said they'll still continue \nworking on Zcash under a new corporate structure   after the disagreement with Bootstrap which is \none of the companies behind them as well. So it   was quite a volatile week and you can see that \nin the price of Ze itself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. if   you uh hang on, let me add this to let me add this \nto the screen. So yeah, um nearly 20% in 4 hours,   but I mean it does seem back up right now. It it \njust jumped to 18%. I'm sorry I had to laugh. The   trending coin at the top there on your screen. \nWhich one's that? You see that? The trending coin   guy. You see the top toprending trending on your \nTwitch on your on your screen. What's happening?   What's happening? Oh, which one is it? Oh, I \ncan't hang on. Go to your screen. I don't know   if we're allowed. Are we allowed to see guys? Can \nwe go long testicle? That's a test. Okay. Well,   that's that's the danger of sharing a Twitter \nscreen, I guess. Yeah. You know that you know   that the suggested and what's happening on Twitter \nis personalized. So, it's done according to your   browsing history. Listen, I've been doing a lot \nof research into testicle and I can tell you I can   tell you there's some interesting stuff going \non there. That's all I'm going to say. That's   all I'm going to say. Um, yes. So, uh, well, yes. \nSo, bearish bearish zeb bullish testicle. Is that   is that the take away from That's the conclusion \nfrom this video. That's the only conclusion that   we can draw, I think. Um, but yeah, it wasn't uh \nit wasn't all that nice for uh for Zeke, although   uh as as as you were saying, Lewis, it has kind of \nrecovered, right? 18% in the last few hours. So,   yeah. Yeah, it's not too bad. Um I Yeah, I don't \nknow what I I have no idea what's going to happen   with it at this point. I was short and then I was \nlong, then I was short, and now I'm just like I   don't know what's going on. So, we'll see. We'll \nsee. But is it like is it as bad as as what people   say or is it like you know a nothing burger? It's \nprobably not nothing burger but like but like you   know who knows. I've heard a lot of rumors. It's \na pretty involved story. I think we've actually   um we've actually got a newsletter piece on \nthis coming out I think uh on Sunday. Um because   there's it's quite you know there's there's quite \na few moving parts to this story. But yeah, it I   mean it is interesting that you know when I when \nI saw that when I saw that collapse I was that 20%   collapse I was like oh this is this is not good. \nBut yeah to see it recover like that suggests that   you know maybe um you know maybe people don't \nreally care about the dev team and maybe the   dev team, you know, leaving isn't necessarily all \nthat important. Well, for the sake of Nick's bags,   let's hope so. Yeah. Yeah. Pray for Nick's \nbags. Pray for my bags guys. Another meta   that you mentioned of course that seems to have \npicked up a lot is this start of this year and   that's because of a new per well it's the perex \nmeta and that's because of a new perex that hit   the scene that everyone seems to be making a \nfuss about and this is lighter now lighter or   uh by the aptly named ticker lit uh pretty cool \nticker there. Uh it's come out and it's actually   done quite well out of the gates. Uh it's got \nI think it's a pretty strong competitor for   Hyperlid. Now we've seen a lot of competitors come \nto you know from for Hyperlquid over the past few   months you know ATA edex a few others but lighter \nseems to potentially can give it a run for its   money in terms of technology it's an ETH layer 2 \nit uses ZK technology um it's uh did a pretty it's   ran a pretty lengthy points campaign which I think \nhas rewarded quite a few people who were involved   early uh so yeah and we actually did a complete \ndeep dive into lighter and a comparison with   Hyperliquid in the Coin Bureau uh Telegram. So, if \nyou guys aren't following our Telegram, uh scan it   right over there in the in the bottom left, but we \nbroke down a comparison between Hyperlid and and   um and Lighter. And we these are alpha posts we \ndo regularly like once every two days only in our   Telegram. So, definitely go and follow that. \nYeah. Yeah. Um have either of you guys traded   on lighter? No, I have not. Louis, I've only \ntraded on hype. I've only done hype. Okay, I   want to share this with you. I this this dashboard \nfrom DeFi Llama I thought was quite interesting. I   mean, it really shows, doesn't it? Like obviously \nHyperlid is still kind of top of the tree. Aster   is running it fairly close on a lot of metrics. \nThen you have lighter and edgex, but really it's,   you know, it's mostly about those, you know, those \nfour in in what is getting an increasingly sort   of crowded field. But I wanted to draw your \nattention to a couple of other entries sort   of further down the list. Now I know to interrupt. \nSorry to interrupt guy. Just very quickly guys, we   got the NFP out and it's come in at 50K. So that's \nslightly lower than expected. So you know that is   potentially good uh from the perspective of more \nlikely for Fed cuts. We'll have to see how things   adapt and adjust over the the spa the span of \nthe next few hours, but yeah, that's just broken.   Okay. Okay. So, the the NFP numbers are good. \nI'm seeing uh Bitcoin 90.5 at the moment. Well,   they're not good. They're worse than expected. \nSo, it's that's that's bad news is good news,   right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, \nso we take we're pleased about the bad news   around people's jobs. Yeah. Okay. Um that's that's \ngreat news unless you're looking for a job. Unless   you can't find a job. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's see \nhow let's see how crypto reacts to that then. Um,   but yeah, just going back to these uh just going \nback to these perexes. Um, if you look, so I'm   scrolling down here and it's only here at number \n36 that I come to Phantom. Um, and then a little   lower down, even lower down at 49 is MetaMask. And \nthe reason I think that's interesting is because   obviously these the two most arguably the two most \npopular crypto wallets certainly for retail users.   um with an honorable mention I think to to Rabby \nwallet as well. But oh my god, I love Rabbi for   eB and base. Rabby has been so good. I switched \nfrom MetaMask a while ago to Rabby and like yeah,   I like it. And Jupiter just came out with not \njust but Jupiter did come out with its own   uh wallet now because everyone uses Phantom for \nSalana. Um and then they attach it to the Jupiter   DEX to do their trading. But now Jupiter has its \nown native wallet so it's a little bit faster. You   don't need to manually approve everything. Uh and \nit's it's native so it you know syncs better with   the Jupiter exchange. So, those are just two \nthings that that I sort of recently did. Uh,   switch from MetaMask to Rabby and switch \nfrom Jupiter to I mean switch from Phantom   to Jupiter. And I've been I've been enjoying \nuh Jup wallet and um and Rabby. They should,   you know, shout out if they want to \nsponsor us or something, but like always always got an eye for business, Lewis. \nThat's great. That's great. Um, I mean I think one   of the things that uh the fact that you know both \nPhantom and MetaMask are fairly low down on the   per list because I noticed that you know Phantom \nespecially um and they both plug into Hyperlid   in the back end if I'm if I'm not mistaken but \nPhantom especially I thought had really kind   of simplified the whole per interface you know \nbecause the the kind of classic um Pers interface   on you know a lot of centralized exchanges isn't \nI've found in the past the most sort of intuitive   things. So, it's not, you know, the easiest thing, \nespecially for beginners to get to grips with. And   then Phantom comes along and kind of makes \nit a whole lot easier to do. But obviously,   these are the kind of number one ways for, you \nknow, MetaMask and Phantom are two of the sort   of most popular ways for PE for kind of retail \nto interact with with their with those respective   chains with Salana and, you know, Ethereum and its \nlayer 2s. Um and yet you know that suggest those   low volumes suggest that retail are not really \nuh trading per all that much you know and per   depending on who you ask is is accounting for an \nenormous amount of actual just general volume in   crypto at the moment. Yeah, I mean fair but to be \nhonest if you if you're a complete noob retail and   you're used to Robin Hood and you're used to \nsome of these easy onboarding sex with these   sexes using a DEX is still a pretty big step up in \nterms of uh you know UX uh and you know especially   if you have to bridge funds and all this kind of \nstuff and I think still many people are complete   newbies are still you know intimidated by the \nconcept of full self-custody um in these decks   per deck so it will take some time before they \nget fully on board. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean   it's it's kind of a good thing in a way really, \nisn't it? Because you pers are, as we know, per   uh, you know, not something to be taken lightly. \nSo, it's probably best that retail isn't um isn't   going crazy on per left, right, and center, right? \nYeah. No, indeed. Yeah. More spot. More spot,   please. Yeah. like less people per trading more \nspot. Yeah. So, should we maybe take a look at   some of the questions, guys, to finish this thing \noff with? Uh maybe some people have some questions   in the comments and we can just answer them. \nThat's another format, guys. We want to try   and include in these Friday streams, by the way, \nis we wanted to try and give you guys more of an   opportunity to ask us questions you had that we \nmay not have been able to answer on the Monday   live stream. We can we can discuss it now more in \ndepth with you on a Friday. So that's why uh feel   free to ask your questions in the comments. We \ncan try and get to them. Yeah. Can you Nick can   you remind us of those unemployment uh non-farm \npayrolls again? So the actual number was 50K and   uh the expectations of 73K. So you know we still \nhad grow we still had non-fame payroll. So it was   still job growth but it was less than expected \nand markets always priced on expectations. Right.   Yeah. Okay. Um are you are you guys bullish \nor bearish this year on the whole space? go first. Lewis, go first. You you catch up. Okay. \nOkay. So, if you're talking like by the end of the   year, I'm bullish. But it's it's actually it's \nmore like like down for down down flat flat flat   and then and then it goes back up to the point \nwhere I'm bullish where it's going to end like   a few percent higher than where we are now. But \nbefore that happens, I'm I'm very bearish for   in most of the year. Yeah, most of the year I'm \nvery bearish. But I think we'll end the year at   least for Bitcoin bullish more than than what \nwe are now. Fingers crossed. So you're saying   basically buy and hold and just not look at the \ncharts. Buy and hold and see the rest of the 300,   you know, six 350 something days. Yeah. I think \nI I I think uh not I think I know uh typically um   people should uh not financial advice or whatever \nbut like statistically if you buy something you   go and you go allin you have a better chance \nmost of the time at outperforming dollar cost   averaging because most of the time uh markets do \ntend to go up and to the right. But if you go in   all in right when you know things are starting \nto go down after you know say Bitcoin went from   15k to 120 you know and then you start and and \nthen you go all in then that's not good. So,   I think now is probably the best time where I \ncould say like, hey, like it's probably a really   good time to dollar cost average into Bitcoin \nbecause there is a probability of it going down   and you want it to go down when you're dollar \ncost averaging because that lowers your average   buy price and then when it eventually goes \nback up again, which I'm pretty sure it will,   uh, then you'll have a much better buy \nprice and you'll make a lot more money.   So, I'm going to be dollar cost averaging like \nnow is the point where I'm going to be dollar   cost averaging into Bitcoin because and hopefully \nit keeps keeps on going down and I get to keep on   buying more and collecting more stats as it does. \nOkay, Nick, how how are what are your thoughts on   this year? Are you bullish? Bearish? Um, slightly \nmore be I'm bearish on on on altcoins. Bullish. I   think Bitcoin my view on the markets is Bitcoin \nstill has uh the macro environment looks good to   the extent that we're going to have liquidity \nthat will go and flow into Bitcoin. I think   Bitcoin is going to uh go back above its all-time \nhigh again. I don't think too much more than above   its all-time high and then it will start retracing \ndown again as we move into you know a bare market.   I think have got a lot a lot of headwinds for them \nuh for many factors. Uh so as a result I if I was   thinking about structuring a portfolio now uh it \nwould be quite bitcoin he which which is what it   is. It is bitcoinheavy and um look I mean uh yeah \nI just I think alt just got too much competition   I think and also it's the question of rotation rot \nrotation right now is called into question through   the structural dynamics of ETFs and everything. \nSo, I think Bitcoin if in terms of Lewis's point   around towards the end of the year whether Bitcoin \nwill be up. It all depends on um you know whether   you think you're going to have a blowoff top or \nif the one last year wasn't a blowoff top. Uh I I   think um we still could we still got room in the \ntank for Bitcoin to continue above its all-time   high. Whether it tops out this year or that's \nnext year will depend on where we where I think   it's going to be in December. But I think by if \nif by June we haven't hit all-time highs again,   then that's um not necessarily bode well for the \nend of the year. Okay. Okay. Interesting. I think   that the two things I'm kind of eyeing up are the \ninnovation exemption which I talked about earlier   because I think how a lot of altcoin projects \nreact to that are going to be that's going to be   really important because I think this is this is \nprobably going to be the opportunity for a lot of   altcoins to kind of show what they're made of and \na lot of the projects behind them to be like this   is the value proposition. we weren't able to offer \nthis beforehand because we weren't sure of the   rules or whatever and the regulatory environment \nwas you know unclear at best, hostile at worst,   blah blah blah. So I think you know if if if a \nlot of projects are able to take advantage of that   then that could you know that could make the case \nfor altcoins and strengthen you know strengthen   the sector as a whole. And of course the other \nbig one is the the small matter of the midterm   elections in November which obviously still you \nknow still quite a long way away. But I do think   you know I I do wonder whether um you know Trump \nand uh and those around him will remember their   debt to the crypto industry that funded them so \nlavishly. uh and is I think you know ramping up   funding once again um for you know for for for \nRepublicans and you know it should be said you   know pro- crypto lawmakers on the other side of \nthe aisle. So um but yeah I do wonder whether   that might uh that might give us a pump. Um human \nbeing is asking can you guys start over from the   beginning? I just got on. I don't have time to \nrewind. You don't you guys don't mind. So we have   a Jamaican themed song. We can restart. That's the \nthat's the highlight. You just need to go to the   intro to the to listen to the song and that's all \nthat matters mate because the rest is kind of just   garbage to be really to be honest. It's just three \ncrypto bros talking nonsense like you Exactly.   Exactly. Um will Trump take Greenland? Oh god. \nI mean I mean that's the next thing. Next week   that that's next week's problem. Hellberg. We'll \nwe'll see. Um interesting one from Cornelius.   Will onchain options become more widely adopted \nthis year especially by institutions uh options   uh per in my opinion? I mean I don't I can't \nsay I can really see institutions going to DGEN   um in terms of what I mean because they're they're \nobviously kind of you know fiduciary duty and   things like that probably prevents them from from \ngetting too uh barack with what they can do. But   I mean it would be interesting wouldn't it like in \nas we say we're you know institutions are becoming   more and more interested. It would be it would be \ninteresting to see what they you know what aspects   of crypto they you know decide to engage with. \nYeah. I mean I think don't think institutions I   don't think institutions are getting involved \nwith per dexes or per options markets at all   because I think that there's just too much fidu \num they got fiduciary duty for their shareholders   their investors. there's risks there's um you know \nfor example I know that many of the institutions   didn't even want to touch um centralized exchange \noptions like the likes of derbit etc and the only   reason everyone was so excited for the um the \nblack rockck IBET options is because these were   them options to they were you know settled on an \nexchange when you've got uh no counterparty risk   and uh it's all within their current structures \nso I think institutions will be very wary of doing   much of the onchain option stuff. Although it'd be \ngood to have an onchain DEX of some description,   I think that some do exist. It just \nnever seen the same amount of uptake   uh compared to from crypto native investors as per \nDexes. Yeah. Yeah. Um one other one, are we in a   controlled bare market or should we just expect \nless volatility as more fouryear cycles move   forward? That's an interesting one. I think we \nshould definitely expect less volatility. I mean,   if we're talking Bitcoin specifically, I think \nit's because of the market structure has changed,   ETFs has changed that deeper liquidity uh and \nnaturally as an as an asset class matures,   it becomes way less volatile. And that's just \nthat's not just a statement. That's a fact   in terms of how Bitcoin's bare bull market draw \ndowns and bare market and and bare market troughs   compared to previous cycles have been. It's been \ndecreasing every every year. Uh and there is there   will be solid bids for Bitcoin. I think if we \nfall even below 80 to 70 I think by 70 in terms   of this year a low we could potentially see is \nat most is 70k but even then you think that's the   lowest. Yeah that's I think deep value territory. \nI think 50k is the is I think that's where we're   going to bottom out. Let's go we'll we started \nwe'll we'll start a prediction market on this.   We'll go and use your the Louiswis and Nick \nbit. Interesting. Interesting. Okay, the final   the final request is um simple one. Nick, can \nyou tie up your hair and look like Legalolis?   I'd love to see guy grow his curly hair and look \nlike Frodo. My hair does actually go curly when I   grow it out. Louise. Louise could be arrogant. We \njust need a dwarf. The company will be completed.   There we are. You can do your golem voice, \nLouis. Okay, my precious. Take the good hand. Well, on that uh on that bombshell. Um I think \nwe will leave it there for this week, folks. So,   look, let us know um what you thought of this. \nDid you enjoy it? Do you want us to see do you   want to see us do more Friday live streams \nlike this? Like I say, a little less formal,   a little more of a kind of meandering discussion \nabout uh all things crypto. Um or did this has   this already completely ruined your weekend and \nyou never want to see our faces again? Let us know   in the comments. We we love to hear your feedback \nand we do take it on board. Um we will be back.   Um we all three of us will be back. Um Lewis will \nbe back in the form uh with his TA on Monday. Nick   and I will be back in the studio presenting uh the \nlive news show as usual. Um, and of course, uh,   lots of other content to come as well. So, Nick \nLewis, I hope you guys have a wonderful weekend.   Thanks for joining today. Likewise. Yeah. And \ndon't forget tariff news, guys. Like, you know,   next half an hour. So, get those orders in, those \norders in place. Yeah, it's it's all kicking off,   folks. Weekends are weekends are interesting \nagain. Um, but h yeah, thank you everyone for   watching. Have a great weekend and we will \nsee you very soon. Bye-bye. Cheers, guys.",
