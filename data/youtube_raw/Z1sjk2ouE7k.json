  "transcript": "This chart on Glass Node is telling me that there should be another big move for BTC. We've been watching it chop sideways between 86K and up to 94K. Is it really going to push up higher? I think it will push up actually to 94K, even above that. But first, we need to talk about that chart on Coin Glass. And before we do, what's up? My name is Aaron Dishner, if we haven't met before, from the Better Traders, and you're watching Coin Bureau Trading. Go ahead and smash that subscribe button, like the video. Let's get into it first with this chart. This is the relative address supply distribution chart. This is showing us how Bitcoin is distributed based off of accounts holding less than 0.001 BTC all the way up to accounts holding over 100,000 Bitcoin. The reality is that there's a lot of noise with this chart. And the only one that I ever watch is this one because this constituent, I guess we could say, has accurately bought and sold at some incredible times. Going to make this a little bit bigger. Okay, so we saw them buying first on the dip, which is normal in a bare market. Buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying. And they were selling. There's a lot of fear happening here. But as soon as we hit a short-term top starting here in April, I want you to see this. There's a big moment of taking profit up 4.128%. Which means that the total amount or rather the total supply over 4% of the supply was held by accounts that had more than 100,000 Bitcoin. Notice where they sell before the pullback. Notice that they buy before the pump. Notice that they sell right here before the market tops out. Actually timing it perfectly at 3.57. Then it drops dramatically down. And what happens back over here in 2024 March Chop City for basically 8 months. And then we see them starting to accumulate here after selling at uh 68K. They're buying at 61K. They're buying more. They're buying more. And the amazing thing that keeps on happening with this group is that they scale out at the best possible time ever where they're up here at 3.55% and then these whales start selling at the perfect place. They start buying on the dips and they start scaling out on the reversals and there's been a little bit of chop ever since here. So they are buying a little bit more into the Euphoria in July and here in August and then October and then selling right here you can see them dropping. But what's been happening ever since here and this takes us basically to the last 3 months. Ever since November 1st, we've seen a big increase. Bitcoin is at 109,000 110,000. So, it's not obviously the best time to buy, but it's clear that since then, they've just been adding and adding and adding and adding. Again, this means that the number of addresses that are holding a 100,000 or more Bitcoin has been steadily increasing. The reason why this is so interesting, like I just pointed out, is that these addresses have an incredible knack of knowing when to sell, when there's going to be chop, when there's going to be a top. Like back over here in March, like back over here in November, Bitcoin went obviously much higher than $94,000. Not to say that this is like this secret hack that everyone has to use and if you don't use it, you're missing out. No. But there's something to be said for Wales coordinating buying and selling. It is really interesting. Now, how does all of this translate into the charts and what we've seen over the last 2 weeks? I'm going to talk about that in a second, but before I do, go to the description down below.

I have a feeling we need to go over to BTC's price action. We know that ever since about here, we've seen an increase since November, even though the price of Bitcoin has fallen down a max of 27%. Now, it's fallen down about 17 or 18%. But during this whole time, we know that the these whales keep buying and buying and buying, which is really really interesting. It's more interesting as well to note that we have all of these bullish reversal signals from TBT bullish divergence which is not part of the TBO indicator. It's a different one. But even the TBO alone is showing us some really good price action. The price is inside of the cloud which means that we're in bullish consolidation. This is great. The price is holding above the fast line right here. Again, really good. The price also just moved above this local high. It's not really local high. It's just a quick little wick, but yesterday it moved up higher. Again, we have all signs pointing right here to $94,000. This is our pivot high, and it's an extremely important pivot high. If Bitcoin hits this level and immediately gets rejected, which I don't want to see that as much as you, but if that happens and it fails to break above 94K, I am fairly certain that we are going to go down here to support at 86K, maybe a short little bounce, but then we're going to be going a lot lower. We're going to be testing this low at 80K, maybe a little bit like this, but it's going to go quickly down more and more and more. It's going to be really painful. This is what I think will happen if 94K is respected. We're going to see the price plummet because we have all of these fake floors of support. First here at 85K, 83K, 80K, then this level here at 74K. It's going to be a rough ride down, but to be honest, this already happened before. It happened. Same exact setup back in March. Now, if we see BTC able to push above 94K, which would be awesome, again, making a higher local high, which would be great, even coming back to bounce off of it. The first target that we can be expecting is actually going to be on the weekly time frame. Let me delete that path. And it's going to be this line right here. This is the TBO fast line, but we're on the weekly time frame. So, this is always our first touch after being really overextended away from this moving average. Why do I expect us to tag that line? Well, for the same reason that we've seen BTC do this back in 2022 right here after printing an open short. We get a nice bull trap reversal up 30% or so to the top of the cloud and a full-on rejection. Saw the same thing as well back over here in 2018. we get a confirmed bare market and we get a TBO open short and the price goes against the trend up to the fast line 20%. This is something we haven't seen yet although you can now see the price slowly starting to move up higher. I know that a lot of people have a mega bullish case where they think that Bitcoin is going to be doing some sort of crazy move like this. is going to go up higher and higher and then going to go up to like $350,000. I really hope it does. That would be amazing. And I'll be laughing with all of you and I'll be trading and enjoying that ride even though I've already sold the majority of my Bitcoin at $104,000, which I'm still not regretting. Now, why do I not think Bitcoin is going to go up higher? Again, this is a gentle reminder. If you haven't liked the video yet, like. If you haven't subscribed, like. What are you doing? Slap yourself. Do it now. Okay, so now that everyone around you is wondering what's wrong with you, they need to take you to be uh evaluated by mental institution cuz you slapping yourself while you're watching videos. The reason why this is a good first touch target is because this happens at the start of every single bare market, which I believe that we have confirmation of from the TBO. Everyone's going to be thinking we're going to be going up so much higher up to $300 million and whatever. It's probably not going to happen. Most of the signs are very clear that we've entered a bare market, that things are going to be going lower. I could always be wrong, happy to be wrong, but I'm betting on the bare market outlook. You guys already know this if you watch my videos. So, a touchup here to the weekly fast line is at $97,712. It could go as high as the weekly cloud at $101,000. It could even go as high as the daily cloud, which is at $103,000. So the here's basically the two scenarios, okay, that I am expecting. Scenario one is the bad news. We get rejected at 94K quickly and then we get a sharp move down here. We go lower and we go a lot lower like this and it's painful all the way down and we just keep dropping more and more and more because we are in a bare market which makes the most sense to me. So that's scenario one. Scenario two is where we see Bitcoin going up to resistance, breaking slightly above, having a slight pullback, and going possibly up to as high as 102 or $103,000 and falling back down, falling back down, falling back down. So no, I don't expect BTC to roar back up to new all-time highs. I expect Bitcoin to go back down. Why? Because we're in a bottom year. We're in a bare market year. I've already made videos about that. I'm actually going to recommend you watch this video next because it's going to explain my reasoning and my thesis behind why I think BTC is going to be going lower this year. But it's not terrible because we will have a great amount of time, hopefully a couple weeks for all to push up again. But that will most definitely be a bull trap considering that I think BTC is going to be going down, which means everything else goes down. Now, watch this video first. It'll give you some context. Until the next time, you know what to do. Stay awesome and stay in the green.",
