  "transcript": "Imagine waking up to find your stock could be forcibly sold. Not because earnings missed, not because of a corporate scandal, but because an index committee decided to change a definition. Well, that's the situation that Strategy is facing as Morgan Stanley Capital International considers booting it from its indexes. But Strategy isn't going without a fight with the company even stating that this is a matter of US national security. So, in this video, we dig into why MSCI might remove Strategy stock from its indexes, on what grounds Strategy is protesting, and how impactful Strategy's removal might be for the stock and BTC itself. My name is Lewis, and you're watching the Coin Bureau. First up, I must make one thing clear, and that is that I am not a financial adviser, and nothing in this video should be considered financial advice. This is educational content meant to inform you about strategies potential removal from MSCI indexes. If that sounds good to you, well then hit that like button and let's get into it. All right, so let's start by looking at MSCI or Morgan Stanley Capital International. If you've been active in markets, you may have heard the acronym before. If you've ignored it, well, that's fair. It sounds like the kind of thing that only people in Patagonia vests argue about in airport lounges. And just FYI, it's no longer part of Morgan Stanley. They're entirely separate entities. Anyway, in simple terms, MSCI is a global provider of equity indexes, benchmarks, and analytics used by institutional investors to measure and manage portfolio performance. Some of the big ones you might encounter include MSCI World for developed markets and MSCI ACWI, the all country world index, which covers both developed and emerging markets. But to be clear, MSCI isn't just a company that publishes a bunch of indexes. For many institutions, MSCI is the default benchmark. It's the yard stick a huge chunk of the investing world uses to decide whether they're outperforming, underperforming, or about to get fired. And beyond benchmarking, many ETFs are explicitly designed to mirror specific MSCI indexes. So, what kind of numbers are we talking here? Well, currently according to MSCI, about $18.3 trillion in assets under management are benchmarked to MSCI equity indexes, meaning that's money whose performance is being judged against MSCI's line in the sand. In addition, however, over $2 trillion in equity ETF assets are linked to MSCI indexes, that is tracking them directly through index products. Now, you might be thinking, \"Okay, but aren't passive flows the only thing that really follow indexes?\" Well, passive flows are one big part. But if an ETF or index fund is designed to track an MSCI index and MSCI says stock X is in, then the fund is essentially forced to buy stock X. Equally though, if MCI says this stock is out, well then the fund sells. No debate, just instructions. But active managers care too and sometimes in the most predictable way possible. They hug the benchmark. Their mandates, their tracking error limits, and the basic reality of performance comparisons push them toward a tendency to not be wildly contrarian. So even when a fund is technically active, the benchmark still has a big influence. Not necessarily because the portfolio manager loves rules, but because underperforming the benchmark while you're off doing your own thing is how you become a former portfolio manager. And that's the important part. This is why MSCI index decisions can create real mechanical buying and selling. And it's also why index changes can turn into very significant events that can make or break a stock. In practice, index providers announce changes. Markets get a heads up and then on the effective date, a lot of the required trading gets compressed into a narrow window. That's because funds that track the index have to be aligned when the index changes that creates a big burst of volume and often some absolutely cursed short-term price action. So, you could see how this is a big deal. Indexing doesn't really ask the market's opinion and it doesn't care about your thesis. It's just a set of rules that turns into orders. And needless to say, when you hear that MSCI might exclude strategy, don't ignore the significance of that for strategy stock or BTC itself. Much more on that later. So, what's MSCI actually doing here? Well, they've opened a formal consultation on how to treat digital asset treasury companies or DATs. As you probably know, DATs are businesses whose primary thing is holding BTC or other crypto assets, usually focused on raising capital to stack more coins. MSCI's proposed change would alter how DATs are viewed. If a company's digital asset holdings are 50% or more of total assets, they'd be excluded from the MSCI global investable market indexes. That 50% threshold is a big issue for the current lot of DATs, including strategy. With this proposed rule, MSCI is communicating that many DAT business models look a bit out of place in their indexes, and they're wondering whether they should be pruned out. Essentially, MSEI is asking whether these DATs belong in the bucket meant to represent the mainstream equity universe. But why exactly did they draw this line? Well, MSCI says some market participants argue these firms look more like investment funds and funds aren't eligible for these indexes. In other words, many argue that companies like Strategy are essentially just levered crypto bets rather than actual operating companies. MSCI is asking whether these businesses just so happen to own a lot of digital assets or if they're crypto asset vehicles in disguise. Formulating a clear rule is tempting, but it's messy in practice because it's an asset test tied to something that moves like crypto moves. Total assets is a balance sheet concept. Digital assets are well digital assets. If a firm is near 50%, they don't need to change the business to cross that threshold. The market can do it for you overnight. A rally can shove you over. A draw down can pull you back under. But in any case, that's why strategy is getting caught in this net. The biggest, loudest corporate BTC treasury on Earth is unsurprisingly at the forefront of this MSCI decision and the debate surrounding it. If this all seems a bit messy, well, that's because it is. Dats have already been struggling lately, and this would be yet another blow. But if you'd rather avoid the potential mess associated with that stocks and index rule changes and just trade the digital assets themselves, well then you could just simply check out the Coin Bureau deals page. That's where you'll find signup bonuses of up to $100,000, trading fee discounts of up to 50% and deposit cash backs of up to 75% on the best crypto exchanges. So if you want those deals, all you need to do is just hit that link in the description or scan the QR code on the screen. Then once you get on the deals page, find a deal that suits you and click one of the sign up now buttons. Remember though, these deals won't be around forever, so take advantage of them while you still can using the link in the description or the QR code on the screen. Now, Strategy co-founder Michael Sailor is not exactly known as the quiet type. So, what was Strategy's response to MSCI's move? Well, you don't often see a public company write to an index committee like it's sending an amicus brief, but Strategy did exactly that. The firm sent a letter on December 10th to MSEI's equity index committee on the proposed digital asset treasury exclusion criteria. The letter opens with a clear claim that sets the tone. Excluding companies whose digital assets are 50% plus of total assets is misguided and would have quote profoundly harmful consequences. Strategy's first move is to reject the label. The firm says DATs like them are operating businesses, not investment funds, and that MSCI's fundlike framing is a category error. They argue MSCI's oneline rationale that some market participants think DATs look like investment funds is too thin to justify rewriting eligibility standards. Importantly, Strategy says that they don't passively hold BTC. They run a Bitcoinbacked treasury and capital markets program that engineers digital credit instruments then uses financing proceeds to buy BTC. They highlighted that after MSCI included strategy in developed market indexes in May 2024. The company kept expanding this playbook including issuing five listed preferred securities in 2025 alone. Strategy claims its model is to capture the spread. If BTC's long run returns beat their dollar financing costs, shareholders benefit and management can evolve the business into other uses of reserves as the industry develops. And they stress investors aren't buying onetoone BTC exposure. You could get that directly or via exchangeraded products. Instead, strategy says shareholders are buying management discretion and a business model that can trade at a premium to the underlying coins. Next, they argue that Strategy's structure doesn't resemble a fund. Strategy says that it's a standard corporation with governance, no redemption rights, no management fees, and no mandate to track BTC or any index. They also argue they're not an investment company act vehicle because BTC is a commodity and that concentrated asset balance sheets already exist for commodities like oil or timber without MSCI labeling them as a fund. Then comes the 50% threshold itself. What strategy claims is quote discriminatory, arbitrary, and unworkable. The firm says this singles out digital assets while ignoring plenty of other concentrated asset models even though equity investors in all of them are paying for what management can do with an asset base. They also argue that it would create index whiplash because digital asset prices can push a firm above or below 50% without any strategic change. as we noted earlier. Plus, to enforce it, MSCI would be forced into constant auditing and novel monitoring, policing book versus fair value, indirect exposure through subsidiaries, complex contracts, and many more headaches. Accounting is where strategy says the simple test is likely to break globally. They argue BTC is fair valued under US accounting standards, while other systems used internationally can book at cost. We won't get into the nitty-gritty here, but the key takeaway is that similar economic exposure could lead to different index outcomes depending on jurisdiction. In other words, it could be quite a mess. After all the mechanics, the letter goes for MCI's identity. Strategy quotes Msei's own stance that indexes should accurately and objectively measure markets, provide exhaustive coverage, reflect market evolution, and avoid judging whether an investment is good or bad. Getting a bit spicier still, strategy then argues a digital asset specific exclusion test looks like MSCI injecting a policy judgment into benchmarks. That's combustible for institutions that need neutrality, especially after the broader backlash against what was viewed as policy laden investing through things like ESG. But strategy didn't stop there. Oh no, beyond all the standard reasoning, the letter escalated to national security. Strategy presented BTC as foundational technology, a scarce digital commodity plus infrastructure that enables permissionless transfer. They argue DATs are helping build an emerging financial system around it. The way earlier infrastructure bets became the backbone of whole economies. From there, they claim that the US government is treating digital assets as a matter of critical importance. The letter mentions initiatives like the strategic Bitcoin reserve, retirement plan access, and technology neutral regulation. Strategy warns MSCI's proposal would conflict with that strategy and kill innovation. The company contrasts this with CBDC style alternatives, naming the digital one, and argues that sidelining bitcoinbased finance strengthens state controlled models at odds with US economic liberty and security priorities. Serious business here. On top of this, Strategy claims that exclusion would shut DATs out of roughly $15 trillion in passive benchmark linked capital. So after all the fireworks, strategy asks for something pretty straightforward for MSCI to reject the proposal. They stress that MSCI citing that some market participants felt a certain way isn't a standard on which you could build a global benchmark rule. Quite the response then from Michael Sailor and company. But amid all this drama, one thing is abundantly clear. When an index methodology dispute starts overlapping with foreign policy, you know the asset class is now in the big leagues. So now comes the big question. What happens if MSCI actually removes strategy stock from the big global benchmarks? Well, the first order effect is straightforward but nasty. Any fund that tracks those MSEI indexes, ETFs, index mutual funds, and a whole slew of other mandates would be pushed to sell strategy stock because the index said so. And because tracking funds live and die by tracking error, that selling often gets crammed into specific windows around the effective date, usually near the close. Translation: confirmation of a removal often results in a particularly nasty but acute wave of selling. JP Morgan analysts have warned that removal from MSCI indexes alone could result in about $2.8 billion dollars of outflows for strategy. But it wouldn't necessarily stop there. If other index providers were to follow suit, which is possible, those analysts project up to 8.8 billion in outflows of strategy stock. Now, it should come as no surprise to you that when the market knows a forced seller is coming, it doesn't politely wait. Some managers pre-trade to reduce slippage. The fast money crowd tries to frontr run the whole thing. Index funds and institutional managers often begin trading before the official adjustment to minimize tracking error. While traders and hedge funds look to profit from the dislocations created by forced buying or selling. That whole dynamic can result in a pretty wild window of volatility. Not entirely new information, just aggressive repositioning. There's often a drift lower into the event, then a burst of volume into the rebalance, then an aftershock period where liquidity is thinner because the passive benchmark bid isn't there anymore. Beyond the stock price, there are potential corporate consequences for strategy. Its BTC treasury machine works best when it can raise capital efficiently, and that's much easier when the stock is strong and its MNAV or marketto bitcoin net asset value is above one. If the stock is pushed down by forced selling after an index removal, MNAV can fall to or below one, making new equity sales far less attractive. That's important because issuing equity has been a key way Strategy has funded its BTC purchases. At that point, investors want a deeper discount and lenders want higher rates, shrinking the spread Strategy relies on and making future funding more costly and more dilutive. And that's not to mention that general optics and the impact on sentiment. Headlines reading that strategy was kicked out of MSCI becomes an instant narrative weapon for bears that drives potential investors away even if nothing operational changed overnight. And of course, this negative impact could extend to BTC itself. Not because strategy would suddenly become a forced BTC seller, but because an MSCI exclusion would read as another riskoff signal for BTC. The spillover would be mainly narrative and positioning. A negative feedback loop of strategy stock slipping, pushing BTC lower, which then weighs on strategy stock again, and so on and so forth. However, it wouldn't be the immediate BTC supply overhang that some seem to be fearing. On that note, it's worth pointing out that strategy has recently raised roughly $1.44 44 billion of cash specifically to cover preferred dividends and debt interests for about 21 months. That makes a near-term forced BTC sales scenario unlikely unless conditions turn truly extreme. Nevertheless, the overall impact on BTC would certainly not be positive, but the impact wouldn't stop at Strategy in BTC. If MSCI draws a clear line around digital assets on the balance sheet, other DATs may start optimizing for index eligibility by restructuring. There are also BTC mining companies that could fuel enough pressure to adjust significantly. Whether that's holding less BTC through cycles, selling more production, or separating Treasury from the core listed entity. So, it may just appear like a case of strategy versus MSCI, but the potential implications for the wider crypto market can't be denied. With all of that said, here's what to look out for from here. Msei's consultation stays open until December 31st this year, but final conclusions due by January 15th, 2026. If they go ahead, Msei says any changes would land with the February 2026 index review. Between now and then, the devil is in the details. The final writeup needs to clarify what primary business actually means and any changes regarding the 50% threshold. Another indicator is who piles into the comment process. If more prominent firms and asset managers start filing letters, that's pressure MSEI can't ignore. Strives public push back is a good example of how this is turning into a broader lobbying fight, not isolated complaints from strategy. And then there's the ultimate market tell price action. Watch price movement around the key decision windows. If MSTR stops grinding lower into January and it doesn't dump, even if some sort of bad news hits the headlines, that could be the market telling us that a removal is priced in. For all the drama that has come of this situation, JP Morgan has argued that much of the MSCI exclusion risk is already priced in, which means the decision could matter a lot less than the reaction. And that is going to wrap up our outlook for Strategy and its clash with MSCI. But what do you think? Will strategy get the boot? Does it deserve to be in the indexes to begin with? Well, let us know your thoughts in the comments below. And if you want to learn more about other major changes to crypto rules that are set in stone for 2026, you can check out that video right over here. That's going to be all for now. Thank you so much for watching as always, and I'll see you again soon. This is Lewis signing off.",
