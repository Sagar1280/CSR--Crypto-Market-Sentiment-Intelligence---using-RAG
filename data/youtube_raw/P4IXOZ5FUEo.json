  "transcript": "One moment, please, while I get my video camera up. There we go. Boom. Boom. Boom. And Almost there. Got my camera to the cam link. We are live. Put the audio. Going to put the audio on the Scarlet. My mic should be good. Let me know if you could hear me. I am uh >> River Crypto. I'm not I'm not River Crypto. [snorts] Um yeah, hit me up in the chat. Just let me know. You could hear me, you could see me, and everything is all good and then we could get started. Okay, sweet. Perfect. Perfect. as long as it's um sounding good. And if I put full screen, looking good on the uh you know, it's in focus. I got the light. I got a new light cuz last time people said that I was not lit up enough and I was very dark. So now I have the new light. Um yeah, so today I essentially just want to go over a lot of uh fundamental stuff. basically basically things that you should know and you should probably be doing but you're probably not. And I only I didn't really prepare too much uh because I wanted to uh this is a live right you know if you want if you want the prepared stuff we have all these prepared things. So, I want to make sure that I go off of like sort of go off the dome, but also answer your questions if you have anything. Um, so I prepared a little bit. Uh, but we're just going to keep it pretty short. It's not going to be too long, but it's going to be going over things that maybe you might think like, \"Oh, this is this is interesting.\" Or like, \"Oh, I didn't think of that.\" Um, which will then make you want to like go deeper into whatever I'm talking about, right? Uh so yeah, I have a couple I have a couple topics here. Uh the other thing the other thing I want to say is that like if you have any questions, if you have any anything that you know concerning trading or crypto on your mind, just let me know in the in the chat and I'll answer them to the best of my abilities. Um so we're going to start off with uh basically the four parts of trading. And it it's not it's it's the four parts of trading, but it's also the four parts of investing and in general and like markets in general. And the four parts are psychology, risk management, fundamental analysis, and technical analysis. And I wrote them down right over here. I'll I'll make it I'll make it way bigger for you guys. And what I've noticed is that this is what I've noticed. People love the technical analysis, right? They when it comes to trading there, it's either two it's either two camps essentially. They either love the fundamental analysis or they love the technical analysis. It's just those two that like 99% of the focus is on. If you are a technical trader, then it's most likely the technical analysis, right? If you are basing your investment decisions on news and you're basing your investment decisions or trading decisions off of um rumors and things like that, then a lot of times it's, you know, fundamental analysis, right? Like updates or like to the to the crypto, to the software, to the company or mergers or whatever, right? Um that's fundamental stuff. And my personal take on this is that you could you could literally see everything in the charts and you actually don't even necessarily need fundamental analysis. You could you could crush it with just technical analysis when it comes to trading. Um, however, I would say that um, the people who tend to make the most money, especially in crypto, do tend to be the fundamental analysts who buy the projects that they, you know, get into because they could see the narrative. they could see things forming and then they go into those and then they just basically hold them until, you know, the bull market uh comes and they and they ride it up, right? And that's that's how I've seen people make the absolute most amount of money in crypto. But if you want a more structured approach uh to making money, then it's really technical analysis is the way to go. And and I guess a uh an example of this that I that I can think of off the top of my head right now is is the fact that I use um I use technical analysis and fundamental analysis, but for the most part I've been using technical analysis. I know other people who have used fundamental analysis and and no risk management. And they went so so so heavy into uh this coin called Popcat, you know, a memecoin and into Sheba Enu and into Dogecoin, into all these other things that did really really really well. And they ended up making an absolute killing. So, and they made way way way way more than me or any other trader who you only uses technical analysis that I know. However, this is the problem. they ended up losing almost all of the money. They end up losing it because they hold it, but because they're not using any technical analysis, they end up giving it all back because they don't know when to sell. And that is a huge, huge, huge problem that a lot of people don't have. And it's a great reason why if you can combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis, you could get absolutely insane gains potentially. Allegedly, I don't know if I'm allowed to even say this. Um, so let me just put throw the disclaimer out there, okay? None of this is financial advice. Uh, always consult with a financial adviser, yada yada yada. Right? Um, I have to, you know, get that out of the way. I'm not I'm not a professional. Uh so now that we have the disclaimer out of the way, I just want to share my personal experiences. I want to share my experiences that I've had with friends. I want to and and everything throughout the nearly nine years, which is almost a decade in this market. Wow. That is that is a long time. Um [laughter] so I'm gonna look at the chat real quick and then I'm going to keep on going. Uh so yeah, first look at promising projects and then look at the charts. Exactly. Combining combining technicals and fundamentals or fundamentals and technicals um is the way to go. Uh try to de uh dive deep into white papers. Okay. Honestly, who who has been uh reading white papers after like 2021? I feel like no one has no one reads white papers anymore. um and probably for good for good riddens uh for the most part because a lot of times uh it doesn't even matter. Um and you sort of have to do like multiple steps of thinking in order to know if a cryptocurrency is going to do well or not. And if you're basing it like just off of the tech, uh that's not that's obviously like not always the case of of it doing very well as we saw this cycle where meme coins um and did very very well when other coins with incredible tech did actually like poorly, right? So you have to use a lot of different uh aspects when in when you're in this market. Um I oh the clarity act not and and and the second thing um second comment uh clarity act not getting any decision. I'm uh I think I said it on the live stream. I'm I'm pretty certain that you know this is the government. You have to have your expectations in place. Okay. And the and the expectations should be that it's things are going to get delayed. Nothing's going to happen for a long time. And um so that that's what I was thinking. So, I have I really don't even don't even feel bad. Don't don't feel good. Don't feel bad anything about it. Um because I just figured I figured it's going to it's going to be a while regardless. And I'm looking at the charts for the most part. Uh so I just uh I try to trade trade the charts. So, and that's ultimately like what I care about. And that's what you should care about, too. It's like is like what is the money that's in your portfolio at the end of the day, right? Like people could say this or that uh good things, bad things. They could talk about the market in one way. They could talk about a project in one way. They could uh you know absolutely say that this coin is going to the moon or that coin is is is garbage. But um at the end of the day, it's up to you to make the decision of whether you're going to buy it, whether and when you're going to sell it. And all of your decisions ultimately are going to be reflected in your balance in your portfolio at the end of the day, right? Um, so it's very very important like you guys probably already know this. It's it's super important to to find people who you could trust. Um, but at the end of the day, like it's your it's always going to be your decision, right? No matter what anyone says. Um, and if you could just take full responsibility of of all of your decisions in your life, then what that does is like it it essentially gives you freedom to be able to do anything. It it lifts the lid off. It, you know, uncaps you, right? Because if you blame other people for like things that happened to you, then uh and you don't take the personal responsibility, then there's always going to be like a ceiling that's put on you from other people. And so what I do personally, I know this is a totally big tangent right now, but what I do personally is just like all the blame like always goes on me. And that way it's like it's it's all learning experiences. Everything is a learning experience. Okay? And then um and then I just you know try to do better next time. And I think that's a great philosophy for life. Now I think we could go back to the actual charts and uh and the and the fundamentals of trading and investing. Right? So what I talked about was that there's four parts four main parts of trading. Psychology, risk management, fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Everybody loves fundamental and technical analysis. the mo but but but the two parts that you should be paying attention to most are psychology and risk management. And it's funny because these are the least uh like people pay attention to these the least. They they do the least amount of work when it comes to their psychology and to risk management in their trades. And I heard one time from a professional trader um he said the word trader is not necessarily the best term for what we do. One of the best things that we that we could do and and one of the best terms that we could have for ourselves is to be a risk manager. Okay? And that's essentially what you're trying to do. You're managing your risk. And you should be managing your risk on every single trade. Um, but really when it comes to these markets especially and and I'd say like 90% of people out there, they don't manage their risk. They sort of just like yolo in to whatever they think is going to do well. And then um they're just like, \"Okay, yeah. Uh, I'm just going to yolo in and and and see see what's up.\" By the way, I'm going to make myself a little bit bigger because why not? Why not? I'm here with you. Okay. So, let me uh let me see if I could let me see if I could do this right now. I'm gonna update this and hopefully I'm a little bit bigger now. Um that's what she said. Okay, so these are the four parts and honestly you could go into Claude, you could go into chatbt, you could go on YouTube of course and just type these in. psychology, trading, risk management trading, fundamental analysis trading, technical analysis trading, and and learn it. And it does require a lot of time. Uh, and anyone who says that they understand trading and they haven't been trading for I would say minimum one year, minimum one year, that I don't they just simply I I don't think that they know. I don't I wouldn't trust it. I just wouldn't trust it. uh because it takes a year minimum, typically two years if not longer to fully grasp the markets, fully get a handle of the markets. So, if you've been trading and things haven't been going your well, you know, your way, um and it's been under one year and honestly maybe under two years, I would say like the market is still teaching you like you're still paying your tuition. Same thing with college, right? Like you don't go to college and pay your tuition and then learn everything in one year. It usually takes four years and then you get your degree. The same thing is with trading. You It takes a long time. It takes two, three, four years and then you get your degree and then you have a deep understanding of all of the different aspects that have to do with trading and whatever uh market you're trading and whatever asset class you're trading and the different asset classes that there are and monetary policy and and all of the things that require uh knowledge when it comes to Bitcoin itself, which is, you know, a handful of things uh like the Federal Reserve and and monetary uh debasement and inflation and um what is it uh fiat currency and the history of fiat currency and the history of of you don't really know need need to know the history of uh cyber um like cipher punks and stuff like that but you have to know a lot and so and so continuing on what's up what's up DJ DJ Morales in the house um so yeah going on I'm going to talk about a few more things. First off, we're going to go through these trading versus investing. Okay, so what you have to realize is that if you're trading or if you're investing, typically there is a sell point, right? Typically there's a sell point. what I what I used to consider investing was holding something for over one year, right? But I have another and that's because of tax implications to be honest. That's the only reason um why I thought it was like that was because of tax implications. But now that I'm thinking about it, investing, investing might actually be more accurate to say that if you are planning on buying something and never selling it, then that is investing. And you might be thinking, oh, well, why why would I buy something and never sell it, you know, because I'd sell it for a profit, right? Well, what I'm thinking of this is, okay, you could buy something that has long-term potential, like that you never need to sell, like the S&P 500 or Bitcoin for example, for instance. Um, and then eventually take out loans against it, like real estate, right? You don't ever necessarily have to sell. Um although I I wouldn't recommend doing that because I I I would recommend buying and selling which essentially is trading. You know that that's what that's what trading is. Whether it's with an hour, a minute, a second, a minute or all the way up to days, weeks, months, or years, it all ends up being a trade anyway, right? And so when you're when you're trading, most people most people have it totally wrong. um and they don't know what they're doing and they don't have a game plan and they they just they focus on the thrill of it. So, it's super super important to get get as clear as possible with yourself. Like look, if you're going to take trading seriously, you need to you need to treat it like like you're trying to become a doctor, right? You have to get down the risk management. You have to get down your edge. You have to understand exactly the reasons why you're going to be getting into a trade and why you're going to be getting out of a trade. And when you're first starting, you might want to do paper trading. I don't necessarily agree with that. Um that you might hear that that you should do paper trading. I don't think you should. I think real money on the line will get you where you need to be faster and it'll uncover a lot more things because of the first part of trading which is psychology which is like 90% of trading in my opinion is psychology. So when you're paper trading it's it could give you some data but it's not going to give you the data that you need when it comes to your psychology. So, I think trading with real money, even if it's just a small, like obviously just small amounts when you're starting out and when you're testing strategies and stuff, is is a good idea. And the second thing comes down to testing your strategies. I have a question for everyone who's watching right now. I don't know how many people are watching, but for everyone who is and who could also type, I want to know something. How many of you actually know have have and execute at least let's say two strategies like you know your strategy you know exactly when to put it on. You know exactly why it you know um basically why you are doing it, why you are buying and why you are selling. and it's all part of a specific strategy. If you have that, put like put a one in the comments or something. Yeah, put a one in the comments if you have a strategy that you know of. If you don't, put a zero. If you don't have an exact strategy that you understand completely, and that could be that could be anything. It could be you buy at you buy at support and you sell at at the 12-h hour support and you sell and you sell at the 12-h hour resistance, right? The daily support, daily resistance, whatever, right? Or like you wait for an overunder or you wait for a fair value gap or you wait for a a bullish order block or be order block or whatever, right? You you buy at the golden ratio and you sell at the you know resistance. Okay. Yes, it does take it does take forever to build one. It does take a long time to build one. Okay, so one zero zero one one. Okay, so um and keep on keep on putting it in. Uh zero if you do not have a strategy, one if you do have a strategy. Okay, I just wanted to know this uh because I want to know like the the the type of people like just the audience essentially like you guys. And if you have a zero, right, if if you don't have a strategy, if you put a zero down here, that should probably be the first thing that you actually like work on. So when it comes to trading the a lot of people a lot of people think that psychology is the problem is their problem. And this this happened with me as well. I was thinking, \"Oh, why can't I why can't I stick with this?\" You know, but when I dove a little bit deeper, what I realized is that it wasn't actually psychology. It wasn't actually the psychology that was the big problem. It was the fact that I just simply didn't have an exact framework. like like like like I don't know I don't know about you but for me if I don't have like step one step two step three written out and and and something that I could follow with like no ambiguity like if I can't if I don't have something like that then my ADHD brain will mess things up and so yeah it took me forever but I did finally build a strategy and now I know I know now I will only take a trade if it is within the particular confines of my particular strategy and I know this and and that's what I do it like that because I know that my strategy has an edge okay and I know this because of testing test it says test your strategies Okay. So, trading versus investing, trading with real money is better. Having a strategy and then testing your strategy. Okay, this is this is the next thing that you have to do. Um, literally like you have to test your strategy because if you don't test it then there's always going to be a little bit of doubt in the back of your mind, right? And sweet, sweet. Um, I don't know who that is, but thank you Gambles. Appreciate it. You're you're you're the man. um what where on X or something but uh regardless you have to test them and there are different ways that you could test your strategies. Obviously back testing is the easiest and um it it's super super easy like back test your strategy. Just go back into the charts and go into a uh charting software like Trading View. This right here that's on the screen right now. This is Trading View. Okay, I'm going to assume that you know what Trading View is. Um, if you don't, just go on to it. It's the charting software that almost everyone uses. Uh, there are other charting softwares and other ones are good. I just like Trading View the best because it uh syncs with a lot of different applications and stuff. You could go back and you could do the replay button and you could just click anywhere on the chart and then you could just press play and as the chart plays out, you put your trade on and you record what happens. Did you end up winning or did you end up losing? And you do this a hundred times. And then you will have a strategy that you know works or doesn't. and you are confident in now the other part about the strategy and I'm just going to um I should just have this up here so there's something moving in the background right for like all the like Gen Z's right um so I'm just going to jump to the real time back again the other part of testing your strategy is if I zoom out this is what you'll see you'll see this chart if I am actually you know what I'm just going to do this there you go ah Ah, no. Boom. Okay. If you look right here in in this section, boom. In this in this section, this is the bare market. It's just going straight down. So, if you put on a strategy and you test and test and test and test in this market and then all of the sudden this is the new market and the market turns and starts going like this. Well, the strategy that you tested right here and was working very very well in this market is not going to work basically at all in this market because they're the inverse of each other. Right? And that's because well, I guess I was going to say market cycles, but essentially it comes down to the three types of markets or three types of price action. And you probably already know what they are, but this is the trading 101, you know, fundamentals. And so we're going to go over them. And that is first off, an uptrend. All right. Second off, a downtrend. Okay. And thirdly, what's third? If someone says it in the chat before um I actually say it, then you will get uh 1,00 internet points. Three, two, one. Okay, it's sideways, right? This is a sideways market. Annoying. Also known as choppy. Also kn Oh, okay. Alpha. All right. All right. A few people got it. A few of you people got it. Sweet, sweet, sweet. Um, nice. Yes. Yes. Yes. Rangebound, consolidation, side action, range. All of them are correct. They're all correct. Um, so these are the three different types. What defines them? Well, it's pretty obvious. Higher highs, higher lows. Higher highs, higher lows, higher highs, higher lows. That is an uptrending market. Okay, so let me just keep on going. One more second. Downtrending markets obvious. Lower lows, lower highs. Lower lows, lower highs. Lower lows, lower highs consistently. And one more second. I keep getting ahead of myself. The third and then the third one, rangebound. Rangebound does not it doesn't necessarily mean uh equal highs and equal lows. It's not you're not always going to get equal highs and equal lows on in a rangebound market, but you're not going to get consistently higher highs or consistently lower lows. And that's why rangebound markets are the hardest. They're the hardest to actually trade because you think at least on the lower time frames maybe, oh, it's going up. Great. Oh, oh, look, higher high. It made a higher high from here. But then what happens? Oh no, it goes back into the range and just falls and goes straight down and then it knocks you out. And so you're like, \"Oh, I'm going to buy at the support.\" Nope. Sorry. It goes under the support. And it's just a reversion to the mean. It's a reversion to the mean. Uh it consistently just goes back to we'll call this uh I'll point this out. We'll just say like this right here, this level uh where is it? Here it is. Is is the mean. All right. Th this is like basically the middle. It's a range and it's consistently moving back towards here. Okay? Or bouncing off of here some way somehow. Um and the reason this is so hard is because you think it's breaking out to the downside, breaking down to the downside, or you think it's breaking out to the upside and then it just comes back in. Um, however, there are going back to what we were talking about before, there are strategies there are strategies that you could use in this type of market. And looking at the actual chart, let's look at the actual chart. Let's say let's say that you put on a trade or you created your strategy, your first strategy in the bare market, okay? And then we turned into a bull market, you know, upwards trend, uptrend and your bare market trend strategy, it didn't work anymore. So you created a second strategy and your second strategy was in the uptrend, right? In the uptrending market. But then this happens. What happens to your strategy that you made during the uptrend? It doesn't work anymore. I'm sorry. It does not work anymore. Why? Because look, high lower high lower high lower high low. Well, I guess this is actually an equal low. But the highs and the lows are so close that even you even though you could say this is a down you know a downward market downtrending it's more likely it's more like a a consolidation. So even if because even if you made a strategy using this market in this bare market, it's not going to work necessarily in a bull market consolidation or a bull market range or a bull market pullback. This isn't this isn't a pullback. This is like a bull market consolidation, bull market range, bull market bull market downtrend. We'll say bull market downtrend. A bullish downtrend. I don't know if I've ever uh heard that before, but this is a bullish downtrend, right? And so what that brings us back to when it comes to the strategies is that you should have multiple strategies, right? And remember, you need to be testing and testing and testing your strategies. Okay? Test, test, test. So important. Test your strategies over and over and over and over again. And that is through back testing. And you could do forward testing while you're doing it. But essentially forward testing is essentially tracking tracking your strategies. Okay? So you could have a strategy in a downtrending market. You could have a strategy in an uptrending market. And you could have a strategy in a sideways market. You should you should put on a hundred trades or 50 trades at least with the within your different strategies with your different strategies for these different markets types of markets, you know, for these different trends. We'll we'll just call them trends. Okay? And then you should continue to test them in real time. Forward test them. And this is important because a lot of times back testing you can you can do a back test and it could look really really good and then for some reason it is just the way of the world. You back test it looks great and then you go to forward test and you actually implement it and it just doesn't work. It just doesn't work and you know it's just the way it is. So because of that um you should always you should always be testing and when it comes to testing that is basically reporting you know analyzing um tracking it's having a a trade journal essentially that's what it is it's having a trade journal so and this also actually comes back to the to another point I made earlier when it comes to psychology versus versus technical analysis. Um, and a lot of people do think, \"Oh, it's my psychology. It's my psychology. It's my psychology.\" Maybe it's not the psychology. Maybe it's literally the fact that you don't have a proven system down or a proven edge and and that is screwing up your psychology, but like underlying it, if you had an edge and you just automated it to the best of your ability, then you would know exactly what to do at every single moment and you would know exactly how much you would lose at every single moment. And that'll bring us into, you know, the risk risk management um in a second, which we'll get to in just a second. Uh but the the other point that I want to make when it comes to markets uh and trends is a little bit of a bigger picture which is what I talked about last time and that's going to be the market psychology which is this chart right here. Um this chart and and this chart as well. Okay. These charts I always have in the back of my mind. I always I always have maybe not even in the back in the forefront of my mind really. I always have these charts because you have to think where are we in the market cycle and if you know where we are if you have an idea of where we are in the market cycle then you could take the strategy that you made during during the bare market right this during the downtrend that strategy downtrending strategy you could take your uptrending strategy you could take your rangebound strategy and you could implement it based on where you think we are in the market cycle, right? So, it's putting these different things together and and you having the really really big picture and then bringing it down and that's, you know, it's like those it's like those Russian dolls that just get smaller and smaller and smaller and they're all built on top of each other or it's, you know, essentially it's fractals. It's time frame. That's when you look at the time frame and you use the big time frame. So, a lot of people what they'll do is they'll go into the 15minute chart and they'll look at this. They'll look at the 15minute chart and they'll say, \"Oh, I'm going to trade off this 15 minute. I'm going to I'm going to, you know, do this quick quick quick.\" And you know what? If you're scalping, if you are if you are playing a lower time frame, then you could do it. You could do that five minutes, 15 minutes, whatever. That's fine. But if you're if you're trading and you're planning on swinging trading and you're planning on, you know, holding, which is what most people do, especially in crypto and stuff, uh you have to do a timeframe analysis, basically a uh multi- sorry, a multi-time frame analysis. So to do that, the first thing that you could do is think about where we are in this in this cycle in the cycle chart. The cycle is like probably the biggest highest thing you could you could think of, right? So first I look at the cycle and then I will look at the actual chart and the time frame of of where of what I want. So, first you look at the monthly and you say, are we in a downtrend or are we in an uptrend when it comes to the monthly? So, on Bitcoin right now, honestly, on Bitcoin, um, this is actually you, there's two arguments to this. There's two arguments to this. If this was the low, if this was the low, then we're technically still in an uptrend. We're technically still, you know, higher highs and higher lows and maybe this is the higher this is a equal low or maybe a little bit of a higher low if you're just counting the lows. We're going to keep on going up. That's a possibility. However, if you are using this this down, you know, this down move right here as a as a low, then um then this is, you know, it went high. It made a higher high, higher low, and then a lower, you know, lower high. But technically speaking, I mean, this actually is this actually is the monthly time frame, higher high. We're still in a we're still on a monthly time frame. But on the weekly time frame, it's pretty obvious we're in a we're made a lower low, right? Because on the weekly time frame, and you could always do this, this is what I do a lot is I use this tool just to plot it out, just to like be not be certain, but just uh visually just see. And you could see right here, oh, we're making higher highs on the weekly, it's looking really good. But then on the weekly time frame right here, we made an equal high. Sorry, equal low. Instead of a instead of a higher low, remember higher low, higher low. Now we made an equal low and then a lower high and now boom a lower low. So now on the weekly time frame we're in a downtrend, right? Uh and that is what that is like getting into strategies now, right? Um I don't necessarily want to like get into actual strategies. Uh but typically the bigger picture is that you want to you want to uh look at the trend in terms of are we making higher highs and higher lows or are we making lower lows and lower highs or are we you know just rangebound and we were rangebound right here like this is this is essentially rangebound right? So you want to look at that and then what's what what's very easy is to just go with the trend. Trade the trend. You've probably heard the trend is your friend, right? So you could go with the trend is your friend and say when we're in an uptrend like this entire, you know, the entirety of 2023 and the entirety of 2024 and most yeah, most of 2025, we were in an uptrend on Bitcoin. So, okay, long, but when we start to go and make a go into a downtrend, then that's when you have to start thinking to yourself, okay, do I really want to be longing and going against the trend or do I want to be shorting and going with the trend? And I think it's 60 over 60% of the time, the trend is your friend. And uh it's, you know, something in motion is easier to stay in motion, right? uh when it's going up, it's easier to continue going up. When it's going down, it's easier to continue going down type of deal. So, you always always always you want to have where we are in the market cycle, where you think we are in the market cycle, then look at the charts and go on the high time frame and then narrow down narrow down narrow down monthly, weekly, daily, 12 hour, etc., etc., etc. And um for that, typically if you're trading the daily, you want to at least start on the weekly. Um if you're trading like the the 12hour, you want to start on at least like the 3-day or the daily. If you're trading the 4 hour, you want to start at least on the daily. you want to move up a few time a few time frames from whatever time frame you're trading and just so you get a bigger picture of the higher time frame and you can narrow it down and narrow it down and narrow it down. Uh so that's essentially that's essentially when it comes to trading and um technical analysis and everything like that, right? So, just as a recap, because I'm probably going to sign off soon enough, um 20 minutes m 18 minutes max. Um trading versus investing. All right, if you're you have to understand, you have to know like are you planning on holding it for a very very very long time or forever essentially when you're investing or are you planning on trading it and you have to know exactly how long you're planning on you know holding it and and essentially everything like that. Then when it comes to paper trading versus real money, I think real money is the way to go. Uh even if it's very small amounts, it'll give you that emotion uh and help you with your psychology. Then you have to actually come up with a strategy. So if you don't have a strategy, you need to come up with them. It I it's it's long, it's annoying, but it's a prerequisite in order to be a trader. There's really no other way, right? Um then of course once you have the strategy you need to test it as much as humanly possible and then you need to track it as it goes you know as the market moves. That's that's a huge thing because if you're not tracking it what's the what is that what's that saying? Whatever gets uh whatever gets improved gets measured. Whatever gets measured gets improved. Whatever gets tracked you could only you could only improve what's get what gets measured or tracked. something like that, right? So, if that's the case, then you have to do it with your trades. And it's like once again, most people don't do it. And that's why that's why 90% of traders lose because they don't do the most basic stuff, right? But you need to track your trades. You need a journal. Have a trading journal. And I recommend manual, manual, manual, manual for the first hundred. manual track everything for the first 100 and then switch to automated and then switch to automated because it gets to be too much of a hassle to be honest uh doing manual all the time. Uh so but when you're starting out and you're developing stuff uh I would say manual is the way to go just so you completely understand every single aspect of your trading journal and what everything means. Right now, when you're going in, let's say, let's say you decided you're going to trade, you're you decided you're going to trade the 12-h hour time frame. Uh you've created a strategy, you've tested it, you've tracked it. Now, you're going to go in and that's where risk management comes in. The the the the essentially the most important part of trading is risk management. So what you have to do is I mean you don't have to do anything just just letting you know that making that clear do whatever you want but um what is advised even though this is not financial advice is to know exactly how much you will lose if your trade is going to lose right every time. So let's say that you want to buy some Bitcoin. So we'll go here and we'll say okay this is my strategy. My strategy is that when I see a breakout of where where is it? Here it is of a an ascending triangle pattern and I see a breakout to the upside. I'm going I'm going to buy it. Okay. So I'll move this up just a little bit. Make it easier. So let's say okay this is the breakout so you buy it. Well what you could do is put on a long position at you know at the close of the breakout. And the most here's another thing most people only focus on what they could win. You as a trader need to focus on what you can possibly lose. Okay? should that you should always know exactly what you could possibly lose. And most people don't know this, but the the formula the actual formula for trading for understanding what your position size should be for any particular trade has nothing to do with your take profit with where you're going to take your profit. You could take your profit all the way up here or you could take your profit all the way down here. your position size for this particular trade, it's going to be the same no matter what. Okay? And that is because all of your position size depends on the stop-loss. Where you place your stop-loss, that is down here, also known as a stop. So, if you are placing your stop-loss, let's just make this easy. Let's say you place your stop loss 2% away. So, we could just move this up so that you could see this right here says 2%. 2.04, but it's essentially 2%. What you need to have is an understanding of number one, how much you have in your portfolio, right? And if you, let's say you have $10,000 in your portfolio, okay? So, I'll say $10,000 in portfolio. All right. And then you need to know your risk per trade equals how much are you willing to lose per trade. All right. Typically, this is let's just say 2% is 2% is typical. Okay. 2% is typical. So, if 2% is typical and you are going to put this trade on, here's the question. How much of your portfolio of your $10,000 hypothetical $10,000 portfolio? How much of that portfolio can you put into this trade, this particular trade? I'm going to wait I'm going to wait like 10 seconds for the comments, 20 seconds for the comments. And that is the question. If you have a $10,000 portfolio and your risk per trade is 2%. And for this particular trade, your stop loss is 2% away from where you enter, how much of your portfolio can you put into this trade? [sighs] All right, we got 200. Anybody else? Anybody else? I'll give you like 10 more seconds. 1%. I'm talking about I'm talking about how much of your portfolio can you put into into this particular trade. You want to risk 2% of your portfolio. You want to risk 2%. So, if you lose if you lose the trade, you're going to lose 2% of your portfolio, how much of your portfolio can you put into this trade? What's up, Mr. Lee Sensei? It's not 200. It's not 1%. I'll give you I'll give you like 10 more seconds. Come on. Somebody got to know. Somebody got to have the answer. Also, while while I'm waiting, I'm going to make myself a little bit bigger. Why not? Why not? Update layout. There you go. What's going on? What's going on, my people? There you go. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. Johnny S, Johnny S or Johnny 5, Johnny 5 I with the correct answer 100%. 100% of your portfolio could go into this trade. Why is that? Let's break it down. Let's break it down. Okay. So, let's say let's say exactly what I just said before. you have $10,000 in your portfolio. If you lose your trade, if you lose the trade, you want to lose 2% of your portfol. So, if you put $10,000 into this trade, you're going to lose 2% of $10,000 if it hits your stop. And that is exactly what we what we just went over, what we just said for the risk per trade is 2%. We we're okay we are totally okay with risking 2% of our portfolio per trade. And because this trade the stop loss is 2% away from from where we enter, then that means if we get stopped out, we're going to we're going to lose 2% of whatever we put in here. So, we could full port. We could go 100% into this trade because we're only going to lose 2%. We're going to we're only going to we're going to lose exactly how much we already predefined. Okay. Second question. Second question. This is not meant to be difficult, by the way. Let's bring it down. Let's bring the stop loss down to 4%. All right. So, now it's four. So, now it's 4% away from our entry. So, our stop loss is 4% away from our entry. However, we want to risk 2% per trade. We want to risk 2% of total portfolio is typical. So we're going to risk 2% of our to of our total portfolio and the stop loss is 4% away from our entry. How much can we put in here? So that if our stop loss gets hit, we're going to lose 2% of our, you know, portfolio. We're going to lose 2%. I'll give you like this one. This one I'll count I'll I'll just count down from 30 in my head and uh let you know. Didn't even need didn't even need I think I got to 24 before the dread bug got it right. Congratulations. You got 5,000 internet points. Yes. Five. It's 5K. It would be it would be 50% of your portfolio. 50% of your portfolio could go into this trade. Uh because if your stop loss was 4% away and it got hit, uh then that would equal a risk of 2%. That would you would lose 2% of your portfolio. So this is the way to think. This is the way to think when putting on trades. H how how [laughter] how most people think is this? This is how most people think. [snorts] Oh, let me go into the 1 hour chart. Oh my god, Bitcoin is mooning. It's going crazy. Let me go all in and just buy everything right now. No stoploss. Uh uh uh. Target. Uh I don't know. Yeah, up here. That looks good. And that's it. They have no idea if you don't know how much you're going to lose if you're wrong. Heck, if you don't know where you're where your idea is even invalidated if you're wrong, how are you going to put it in? How are you going to know if if if you're wrong? You're not you're not going to know if you're wrong. But everyone thinks that they're right. There's Oh, yeah. I'm right. So, I'm I'm not going to do I'm not going to do any of this. I'm just going to put on a trade and go for it. Like, what are you doing? No. No, stop it. Jeez, man. Slow it down and [laughter] and think. Look. Okay, here. I have a strategy. Going back to what we talked about. Let's say I have a strategy. I buy during the breakouts of the triangles of ascending triangles. All right, cool. It's an ascending triangle. It breaks out. All right, I buy it. Uh, let's say I buy it. Um, where am I wrong? I'm wrong. If it goes back below the the the triangle, the bottom of the the triangle. Okay. Well, then well then you know you know how much you're going to lose. You're going to lose seven or you know how much uh where your stop where your stop is. 7.33% away from your entry. So then you just got to do the math. There's plenty of software out there. Uh I like All Trady. It lets you, you know, it automatically calculates your position size and how much you should put in based on based on where your stop loss is. So, it's like where's my where's my where's my thing? You need to know risk management. You need to understand risk management. By the way, I have a video on um my other channel uh just Lewis Rascin risk man. Just go YouTube Lewis Rascin risk management and you'll see it. You'll see it's like an hour twoh hour long video on risk management. It teaches you all of like everything you need to know about risk management. Um highly recommend. And so um that is where risk per trade risk per trade comes first. Stop focusing on what you can make and focus on what you could lose. It's and then then you will be more of a trader than than what most people are because traders like I mentioned before they're really risk managers right um by the way what exchange do you use to trade you could use any exchange uh within your you know jurisdiction essentially if you're in America Coinbase Kraken those are the two to use if you're outside of America bybit uh is probably my favorite and then there's of course you know Binance and stuff And uh yeah, anything that anything that you could use that's within your jurisdiction is is the way to go. And then um to do advanced trading, you could connect it up to this thing called Altrady. Uh that's I'll just type it out over here. It's like a L t a dy ally. And then you could do advanced trades in here that you can't do um you know on the exchanges. And so we went over all of we went over these things right here in this in this stream. Uh I guess the last thing that I want to say uh is DGEN versus actual trading. What I what I went over in this stream is is like quote unquote actual trading, technical analysis trading, right? But when it comes to crypto, a lot of the biggest gains that you could potentially make in crypto come from getting into coins super super super early when they're still on decentralized exchanges and they haven't hit the big exchanges yet. Um, and so if you do that, how do you know how much to risk on on those trades? Because you can't really count on technical analysis if it's only a day old or if it's only a week old or even if it's like three weeks old. you really technical analysis it it it works but it's it's more on the fundamental side and then on getting lucky uh when it comes to buying coins that are brand new right um so how do you know how much to how much to put on well it's essentially the same thing essentially you're just looking at your risk and ask yourself how much can I lose if this goes wrong so for those DGEN trades those more low market cap trades I always assume that they could go to zero And then I just look at my entire portfolio. I look at my my my portfolio at inhole and I say, \"Hey, um I typically risk between two to five% of my portfolio or actually between 1 to 5% of my portfolio on a normal trade. So why don't I just risk 1 to 5% of my portfolio on this trade?\" And the way how I on a DGEN trade and the way that I manage that is I'll just put in an amount to where if it goes to zero and it gets or it gets rug pulled uh or you know I lose it or anything happens in that regard then you know I'll lose 1 to 5% of my account uh based off of based off of that. And that's how I do the DGEN trades. Uh when I can't necessarily do u technical analysis and I don't want to put on a tech technical trade like this because for those coins the swings are so great, you know, they could swing up and down 80, you know, down 80% and then move up 5,000%, right? So you don't necessarily want to do that um in those lower market cap uh coins on those DGEN trades. So that's just how I do it. So, if you have an account that's for instance, let's say uh $50,000 and you want to and you typically risk um 1% per trade, then you could put in $500 bucks into that, you know, into that trade. Or you could you could, you know, bump it up and put $1,000 or $2,000 or um yeah, that would probably be the max if you had a 5050K account. And anyway, that's um technical terms. Okay. So, uh I just learned about trading yesterday. Can you give me a good source on how to learn trading from ground zero? Technical terms, strategies, risk management, indicators, etc. Well, you are on the Coinb trading channel in particular. So, um yeah, I would say there's plenty of videos on this particular channel, uh that you could watch that, you know, cover a lot of different topics. Um even and on my channel as well, just Lewis Raskin, uh on that I have different trading things, uh different trading videos, uh different strategies, uh risk management, all of this stuff, right? So, Coinbau Trading or my own channel like their own the like it's all good. There's a lot of information out there. Um, also there's courses and I know people get um people don't like courses anymore, but I mean d I I I took like five courses. Way I took more than five way more than five course. I took a lot of courses. I took a lot of courses. Like I I bought the courses. Um and like only like one or two of them like it wasn't that good. But like for the most part, the courses like they did help. But I will say you could learn almost everything you need to learn on YouTube. Um I know I think Trader Ched uh Ched Trading or something like that has has a good series. Uh I know on crypto Twitter there's a lot of good stuff. Uh so it's really a and dude at this point now uh Claude you just you just type in you know I want to learn trading uh into Claude give me and and then prompt the prompt will be give me a a breakdown of everything I need to know uh break it down into extremely easy steps uh stuff that I could learn and give examples yada yada yada and I'm sure Claude will give you a absolutely amazing breakdown as well but um for videos and things yeah these are the channels that I recommend uh books as well there's There's uh a book uh called The New Trading for a Living, which is really really good. Um and then there's also Naked Candles. I believe that's uh that's the name of the book. Uh Naked Candlestick Trading. Um I'll just double check that really quickly. It's Oh, it's it's just called Naked Trading. Uh I I like that book. I liked that book a lot because it taught me about the uh probably the most important thing about one of the most important things about technical trading which is the candlesticks. Each candlestick individual candlestick um and that's something to understand to understand candlesticks you will understand trading very well. And um yeah that is that's going to be it for this stream. I ran a little bit over two minutes over. So, I'm going to end it here and next time I'll probably just keep on going a little bit more in depth into these things. I'll in fact what I what I really want to do is create a series. Um, it's going to take me a while to make, but I think it would be pretty cool to make a series uh basically just going over everything that you need to learn uh about trading uh from ground zero. That's sort of what I want to do. It just obviously like that takes a while. Um, I mean I have a course. It's sort of expensive. Uh, but it's uh you can message me on social media or something if you want to know about that. Uh, but I think it's at cryptocourse.com. Uh, but I I just I just I created a new thing. Uh, so I'll have to, you know, just just message me if you want to know about that. But there's so many free information. So much free information out there that it's it's fine, you know, to to just go on YouTube as well. But regardless, that's going to be it for me for the stream. Uh, and hopefully I could create this series for you guys to help with trading and and just from ground zero. And this was a big this one was a big overview. Hopefully you learned some. If you don't have a strategy yet and you want to be trading now, you know, that's the first thing that you should be doing. Um, anyway, thank you so much for watching and I will talk to you all later. All right, appreciate it. Peace.",
