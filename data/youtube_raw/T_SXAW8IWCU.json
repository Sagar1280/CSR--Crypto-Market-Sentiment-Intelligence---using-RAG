  "transcript": "Yo, welcome everyone. Bitcoin has gotten quite a significant pump and major liquidations are about to happen very soon. Let me show you why. Now, first you're going to see our upper volume area of resistance, the value area high of the entire bottom price action is right now clearly getting a break towards the upside. And also remember from our yesterday's video, we talked about our daily height from time frame area of resistance. And right now also it does look like Bitcoin is definitely breaking our daily level straight towards the upside. That is why because of the entire push up I definitely got stopped out on my short trade on Bitcoin. However, I do remain in my long trade on BTC that is approximately 80% in a profit and also I'm being right now still in the long trade on XRP that is being approximately 256% in a pure profit. And of course, yes, later in the video, I'm even going to share with you where personally I'm right now still more interested to figure another short trade potentially very very soon. But what you're right now also going to see, not only the daily level is getting a break up, not only the value area high right here, but also our ascending channel we talked about for the past few days is right now also getting broken back towards the upside, which one could actually say it is going to be some kind of a bullish Bitcoin indication. However, one very important thing was also hit only a few hours ago on this entire push towards the upside. Remember what are the most important levels usually you should pay attention to and of course are going to be the liquidity levels. Bitcoin right now only a few hours ago hit our liquidity level exactly above the recent high. And why is this specific level such an important one? Usually before we get a reversal, we take the liquidity above the recent high. You can notice right here, we took the liquidity above the recent high and Bitcoin then suddenly got a major rejection back towards downside. Also, for example, at the bottom right here, liquidity grab below the recent low, pump it towards the upside. Also, right here, for example, we grabbed the liquidity exactly below the recent low. Bitcoin got another major push towards the upside. where we are as right now. It is definitely a very important liquidity level. However, in my opinion, it's not really a super strong area of resistance. That is why no, I am not going to fire another short trade at this specific area and you're also going to see another reason why potentially we might be looking for at least slightly higher targets. Pay attention to the past liquidations in the past 24 hours. We have gotten approximately 333 million of short trades completely wrecked and completely liquidated on this entire move up. Now, in my opinion, this is nothing significant. That is why ideally I would still like to see slightly higher targets before we can then fire another short or a sell trade. And that's why first of all, right now, let's talk about a bullish scenario we are right now going to be paying attention to. And then I also want to show you a bearish scenario why potentially we can be looking for a bigger rejection back towards downside maybe even in the upcoming weeks simply because again of the liquidity theory usually before we get a bigger reversal we want to take as much liquidity as possible and right what you're going to see we still right now haven't really taken the liquidity below our recent low which in my opinion it is definitely going to be some kind of a bearish bitcoin indication Right. So, let's first of all talk about the upper target. How high can Bitcoin actually go? Maybe even in the upcoming hours. Remember our descending triangle we talked about already a few days ago. The price target of the triangle can very simply be measured by measuring the opening of our triangle and putting the trend line exactly on the breakout. You're right. I'm going to see that the target is going to be quite close from the area where we are as right now at approximately $97,500. Trust me, this specific level is not a random level. Fibonacci from our high back towards the low. You're going to notice that our golden Fibonacci ratio is coming in exactly at the target of our descending triangle. But also, let's go on the daily time frame. Let's right now measure the entire upper price action with volume where you can notice the point of control or the biggest volume cluster coming in exactly at this specific area. So, right now, my plan is very simple. Ideally, I am right here looking for another push towards the upside for Bitcoin to go above our liquidity level and for us to hit our upper price target at approximately $97,000 US and of course at this specific area on some kind of a rejection back down. I am going to look to fire another short trade on Bitcoin and taking even more profits on both of the longs right here on Bitcoin and also on XRP. And that is right now also why I would really appreciate for you to smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible. And of course also thank you for subscribing to the channel right now. Let me do share with you more of a bearish scenario. We are going to be looking for after Bitcoin right now potentially does go slightly higher towards our golden pocket or maybe even if we are right going to already going to get some kind of a sign of weakness at the area where Bitcoin is trading at this specific time. what we are rightly going to do. You probably remember that we have talked about a bigger fivewave price structure towards downside on the daily time frame. We were saying that when we go with our ali impulsive wave, Bitcoin has gotten the first impulse right here. We got a correction, another impulse right here. And right now because of course we are pushing higher, we can still talk about it. Bitcoin is forming the fourth Elliot wave before we are going to get another final push towards the downside and as we also said before potentially a liquidity grab below the recent low before Bitcoin then is actually going to get a bigger reversal back towards the upside. So this specific bearish elit wave count right now it is still being valid but of course we also need to talk about what is right now happening in the fourth Elliot wave what type of a correction we are right now getting so let's go right now back on the 4hour time frame where we are right now going to see Bitcoin has been moving in some kind of a three-wave price structures for a very long time we got a push up 1 2 3 this right here was some kind of a three-wave price structure also right here 1 2 3 and also So what we are seeing right here another 1 2 3 all of those three waves can actually be some kind of an ABC corrections and what we can right to do combining all of the ABC corrections together we can then simply go with the aliot double combo wave or a complex correction WXY so we are right going to say okay we got our Wave right here we got our X-wave right here and right now potentially we are simply forming the last move towards the upside of the entire correction ction which is going to be our YWave. And probably right now you're wondering what is the technical target of our Ywave. It's very simple to measure it and all we have to do is to go with our trendbased Fibonacci extension. We are going to go from the exact low here back towards the exact high. That being said, we are measuring the entire Wave right here. Putting the third pivot at the start of our Ywave. And here the most important target is always going to be the 1:1 Fibonacci extension level that is right going to come in at approximately $98,000. And remember what we said before, this specific area is not a random level simply because we go again with our Fibonacci retracement. We are going to go from our swing high back towards the swing low. And you can write a notice the gold Fibonacci ratio coming in almost exactly at our 1 one Fibonacci extension level. literally almost to the exact dollar accuracy and this is right why yes ideally I am looking for Bitcoin to get another push towards the upside hitting our bigger golden Fibonacci ratio and then we are going to go from there if the rejection is going to happen definitely I'm going to look to fire a short trade right here stop loss above the area of resistance targeting another lower low in the upcoming weeks but also right now what if Bitcoin is not going to right now get another push towards the upside and we are already going to get another push down. Remember always we need to be prepared for higher targets and also we need to be prepared for lower targets in case they are going to happen. In a case right now Bitcoin is already going to get a push towards downside. We are then simply going to say okay this is right now already our Ywave and we are going to look for lower targets but the reality is we need to wait for a confirmation and what is going to be our confirmation right here. Let's go with our fixed range volume profile to measure the entire correction with the volume. And what we can right now say if Bitcoin actually topped out at our liquidity level above the recent high, we then need to get a push towards the downside getting the acceptance below our value area high bearish indication. And only in this scenario, I'm then going to say to you, okay, probably the correction right here is finished. We can then look to find another short trade on Bitcoin on the acceptance back below the value area high, stop- loss above the recent high that was formed only a few hours ago and looking for another lower low in the upcoming weeks.

Right now also let's go and talk about our indicators because the money flow and also the MACD indicator are right now not really looking super bullish anymore for BTC. Let's go first of all with the money flow indicator on the daily time frame where we are right now going to see definitely money flow is coming directly in the overbought area. Last time we were overbought it was literally exactly at alltime high. Bitcoin got a major collapse back towards downside towards $80,000. Also right here overbought on the daily. We got some kind of a rejection back down. Overbought on the daily right here. Some kind of a rejection back towards upside. And right now again we are definitely being in the overbought area. Not only money flow is right looking slightly more bearish right here. But also let's go with our MACD indicator because what you're right you're going to see a slightly lower high is being formed on MACD while Bitcoin is right now still getting a brand new high. potentially this specific setup for a regular bearish divergence is going to be invalidated. If MACD does right now continue even higher but of course at least as right now there is a setup for a bearish divergence on the MACD and if we start going lower this one starts curving towards the downside it is going to be a bearish Bitcoin indication. Now, of course, as you probably know because we also talked about this yesterday, if we go with our exponential moving averages, it really does look like on the 4hourly, yes, we are right now also getting a bullish cross of our 50 and 200 EMA. This right here is actually a significant bullish Bitcoin indication. Technically speaking, also on the 2-hourly and on the 1 hourly, we are getting a bullish cross. It looks like Bitcoin is right moving in an average uptrend. However, again I would say like that even though we are getting a bullish cross right here where we are right now I am not interested to fer another long trade even though we are in an uptrend. Yes we can be looking for a long trade but only after we do get some kind of a push down after we are going to hit our some kind of an area of support. Right now we are just pushing higher. Definitely I do remain in my long trade right here. But I definitely would not fire another long trade where we are as right now in an uptrend. Yes, it's better to go with another long trade. But definitely only after we do get some kind of a push towards upside. And of course, as we said, ideally we are looking for a short trade first of all at our major area of resistance at approximately $98,000. And also right now remember our Bitcoin liquidation heat map. Definitely on the twoe time frame bigger liquidations are not above the recent highs but actually below our recent lows. Over 260 million of long trades are going to get tracked if Bitcoin right does get a bigger rejection a bigger reversal back towards downset. So let me right to share with you exactly what we might even be expecting to happen on BTC in the upcoming days. We go with our gold Fibonacci ratio and that is actually going to be our main price target. After we hit our price target again, I am definitely going to be slightly more careful. I'm going to look for some kind of a short right here. Potentially looking for another even bigger push towards upside for Bitcoin to then literally liquidate a lot of capital from the entire cryptocurrency market. And that is why I'm going to look for another short trade exactly at this specific area. And of course, you can right now also be looking to fire a new short trade right here on B2X exchange because you're going to get some beautiful bonuses.
