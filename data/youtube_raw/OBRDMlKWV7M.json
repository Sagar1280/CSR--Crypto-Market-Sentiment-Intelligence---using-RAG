  "transcript": "Banter Squad, what's happening guys? Happy Friday to you all. Um, so guys, as we could see here on this chart, I do see a break of daily structure and a retest. Market did have an opportunity yesterday to reclaim the level. Um, as it stands right now, it is definitely looking like a rejection, which is actually bringing us, let me just see this is talking in my ear. Okay, there we go. Okay. Um, so for me, a bunch of shorts have just opened up. Now, I want to speak about some big trading opportunities because I do think the market is even is about to even expand its range a lot bigger, which means volatility is going to start to increase. And I actually think there is a nice plan for a three type of trade streak that we're looking for here. All right, there's some shorts available today that I want to go through. um especially if we keep rejecting this level and this should be a push down to the low 80,000s for Bitcoin. Obviously that is a little bit stronger on alts. I'm seeing the Bitcoin dominance coming down a bit today. So it does look like Bitcoin might catch up knowing that alts have been performing worse to the downside. So that is a possibility. But then I'm seeing a strong buy up from these low 80,000s and from there looking at a really strong squeeze to the upside. Then I'm seeing another short after that. So the key here is I spoke to you guys yesterday about me very much focusing around focusing around trading Bitcoin at this point because the risk is just so much better and Bitcoin's actually a little bit volatile as well. So there's some good upturn gains that I want to speak about. I traded it the whole of yesterday. So I want to go through the pros and cons of what I'm learning through both. Um, but ultimately, you know, I'm looking at three different trade setups and getting aligned over the next few days. Key areas of bounces, key areas of shorts. Right now, the risk-to-reward is pretty good on the shorts at this point. But the key is not to hold the short for too long. The key is to grow account to a certain point, wait for the long, get the long, wait for the short, and start building this streak. I'm also going to go through altcoins even though I'm not trading them right now but they're giving very similar setup. So let's get a full understanding and let's get actionable understanding right let's get a full game plan on what's the plan over the next couple of days. So guys missed you all. Energy is still quite low. I'm actually in a little bit of pain today. Um but we're going to keep showing up and keep going. So I'm wasting time. Let's go. I try and help everyone in my space and this is what I get. I try and fight the devils but inside the show. >> Yes, fam. Ah, a little bit of pain in the chest. Brand new channel. Hit the subscribe button. Hit the like button. Um, for those who did not watch yesterday, become a short-term Bitcoin maxi. Not to say that I think they they'll outperform in the long term, but I do think it is time for me to to play the game of trading Bitcoin. Um, I actually doubled my account yesterday. I don't want to talk too soon, right? I want to trade for the next couple of days and really take a focus on day trading Bitcoin. Um, and see how much can we grow money, right? I think the number one thing that I learned specifically in these times in this uncertainty and dominance is the risk is obviously a lot better with Bitcoin. And for me, it's kind of to start making some long-term changes within my brain, right? The upside will always come, right? How can I get so much better at the downside? Now, I've been an altcoin lover since day one, and I've only traded old coins. I've actually been a slight addict because I've had the taste of what they can actually do. And they have changed big parts of my life. Um, but when it comes to sustainability of a trader, and now I'm now going to year five, I've realized that it's it's just not going to get me on the lows. it's not going to get me where I want to get. Right? There's times where can flip a little bit more into alts. Um, but majority of the time if I can start focusing on the best assets and focus on my lows getting a lot less, right? There's times where I can easily go here's just an example, right, of a couple of years back going from $80,000 back to 2 million, three million, right? But then coming back down to $300,000 net worth and then going back up. You know, if I can get to instead of two million, get to 1.3, 1.5, but then my low is like at 800 and then my next high is at four billion, then my next low is a little bit, you know, that's what I'm looking for. I'm learning I'm looking to use this time to not only grow accounts, but to really make some core fundamental changes within my brain. Um, and I think that is going to be a very key to longevity and long successful wealth. the last thing we want to do is make a ton of money and then you know every two years uh you have new lows or or or back at losing 80% of portfolio and wealth and all of these type of things. So I think if you can turn this specific market and where we're at now into a strategy I think it's amazing. So the first thing that I obviously determined between trading Bitcoin and alts is the risk is a lot lot lot better right? So, I traded three accounts yesterday. The one was $100,000 account, the one was a $2,000 account, and the one was a $200 account. Right? The $200 account now, we can quickly have a look, is at $500 now. Okay. The $2,000 account, I'll see if it's logged in here. Okay, it's not logged in. But that one was not as much. But that was on 2,00 on 2,800 and then the 100k account uh I'm up 10%. Right? So I kind of like I was looking at okay if you trade more money like h how how strong do you kind of go? Right? So I'm going quite aggressive on the smaller accounts, a little bit more aggressive on the medium accounts and quite conservative um on the the bigger accounts. And I realized that wow the risk is actually quite insane. Now, the the risk difference, right, it just showed that with that account, I literally 100xed, right, a trade yesterday on the $200 account and I was only risking like 3% or 4% of my total portfolio on the trade. And I was like, how is that? And there was actually space to my stop loss. So when I looked at altcoins, I'm like, if I want that kind of risk category and I want to play with that kind of leverage because my whole debate was, okay, but do you grow money as quick as right? And that's the wrong mentality, but it is a question that I ask. I'm used to that adrenaline and these type of things. And I realized that, wow, so I had a $200 account that I could make $20,000 in size, but only risk 5% of that $200 account on the trade. And that was very interesting to me. And all I got was a 1% move in Bitcoin. Okay. And I doubled the account. I went to bed last night. I actually caught the top of that specific move, which was nice. The second thing that I realized that was very interesting was it doesn't have extra extended wicks the way alcoins do. So when we have levels, let's say it's Fibonacci levels or supports and resistances, when it actually hits that level, it actually specifically if it's going to bounce, it bounces perfectly on that level where altcoins have that extra little wick and that's where the stop losses get hit. So if I look at what was damaging for me over the last couple of weeks was stop losses to be honest because the market actually did this right if we look at very much where we at now chop chop chop chop chop right so it wasn't that it was just I lost money it was I got stopped out lost 3% stopped out lost 5% stopped out stopped out stopped out and end up getting stopped out like eight 10 times in a row right but my stop losses for me were in key areas right key zones where where we shouldn't get stopped out, but those little extra wicks and those little extra moves were creating me to stop out. Where on Bitcoin, we're not really dealing with that as much. Lot more liquidity, a lot more strength, and it's not giving those extra wicks, which means that I'm actually not getting stopped out or or or or losing these little nips too often. And that was a big thing for me as well. It's respecting levels. It's actually bouncing. And I'm when I get stopped out as an example, I'm not losing so much more than what I'm supposed to lose, right? The other day I did a live trading and I was trading ETH, right? ETH of of them all and I had a $350 stop-loss and the market dropped a bit and I lost $650 and I was like, what the hell's going on? Right? And that was a big thing. I was supposed to lose 350, I lost 650 and I was like where with Bitcoin that's not happening for me. So what I'm really doing here is I'm always going to focus on strategies on both. And there's always going to be times where I will start dipping 20% um trades into alts when also are showing strength and things like that. But I'm really just looking at the difference of longevity strategies of becoming real traders that can be sustainable traders and getting stopped and stopped and stopped and you know you know the crazy thing is a lot of times I got stopped the market reversed after that right which means my thesis or my analysis was correct but those extra wicks in these things now again this can change a little bit when bull markets come and there's more volume in the market right markets may not wick as much and these type of things. But the important thing is again longevity because we can have two months of strength in altcoins and then we can have six months of non non strength, right? So just sharing these different things that were quite interesting. Um yes. Yes. That's also a very uh good strategy. Um but it's quite interesting yesterday as an example, right? I'll see if it's this one on Binance here. Here. Oh no, not that. This one over here. Amazing. Okay, let's just put this up. Cool. Like I This is where I caught the lows yesterday, right? Dropped down straight into 618, straight bounce off, straight into trend, and that's where I tped out, right? So I got that trade to that one over there where I look at altcoins, right? And just an example. So just to show you here. So now I put this fib in here. Okay. So look at where we actually ended up bouncing closing right was 618 right but look where the wick went right the wick went down there and unless you caught on at 786 right you could see that that little difference there is what's been trapping the crap out of me within trades right it's it's very very very uh um crazy to see and the more you go down more of the alt as well you will see how just they're a little bit more inconsistent so just giving giving you guys those views. Now, let's go through. So, again, like I said, I'm going to release my my um results next week. Um the the other reason is also just locking in on one coin. Just really really looking at strategy and locking in on one coin, right? And the number one thing for me is just volume and, you know, sticks to levels and it's not super wicky. That's the important thing. We know that volume's low in this market right now. That's another thing of why why I'm kind of uh rocking in on on on Bitcoin. Okay. So, let's go through the plays where the market's at right now. I'm going to speak about a short play. I'm going to speak about um how this short play could be reversed and what that kind of means and to basically get the two scenarios out of what can happen right over the next few days and how we can use this information to make money. That's the important thing. So, as it stands right now, we are definitely starting to break below the trend. Okay, there was an opportunity yesterday and there's still an possible opportunity today to get back into the trend. The only way that midterm I can turn bullish again, right? is to say that here we break back in then there's a possibility of okay market came and trapped kind of trapped everyone because again when this drop has happened now automatically everyone will be thinking 80,000 70,000 they will be thinking that right which means they're going to sit with a bunch of limit orders lower down but we got to remember that it has hit there already right and it's hit there again and it's hit there again okay so all these orders here that are sitting here sometimes times the market wants to play that and if the market goes up all of these guys are going to have to now cancel their orders. They're now starting to regret and the thing is they won't even trust 93,000. They won't even trust 95. But the moment we start getting here to 100, these guys are going to say, you know what, okay, we are reversing. And that is when they're going to look to to to remove those orders and buy in. And then that's when it's probably very likely going to going to trap a bunch of them, right? So, we just have to put ourselves in that thought process of why would the market break back into this trend. It might be that hey, enough was bought in this time and the market always kind of traps before it starts to reverse and these type of things. Okay. But as it stands, the important thing here is to to trade the market for what it's giving. And as it stands right now, we have rejected and it's very likely we're going to start looking at some downside movement. Right? It's really start looking at the 84 83,000 and start looking at the areas of down to the 80,000. I don't want to think too much further down than that because I obviously explained to you guys yesterday that we still have this opportunity of the very big support trend on the weekly, right? We do still have the RSI sitting in oversold. Okay. So for me there's still very much I don't see that we went high enough on this last pump on high time frame. Okay. So there's still very much this scenario and then we could be looking at something like this right over the next couple of weeks, next couple of months. So I still see there's a big opportunity for those longs um incoming. So I'm not really thinking too much the 70s or the 60s or anything yet. Obviously, the the type of plan that maybe changes that is us dropping through over here again, I'll probably TP out there, no problem. But then this will be the sign for me to say, okay, more downside. Let's let's go bare strategies. Let's let's go short strategies. Let's trade it down and let's sell the house when we get here. Right. Okay. But uh uh nonetheless, exactly that. So, I'm not thinking too too too far because of this high time frame trend over here. So this block of where I'm putting now is actually the short zones on Bitcoin. Okay. Now the next thing we kind of look at is risk, right? And this is the important thing here. So if I'm looking at risk, I'm basically looking at these last three highs that we have made, these last three candles here. And I'm basically saying, hey, that's kind of the resistance, right? There's three times now. It's respecting that trend. That's very much good. So the shorting areas for me, and I'm actually in a small short at the moment. So, I'll show you guys. Uh, okay. I don't know if you're going to be able to see it though. Yeah. Okay. But I am actually in a short and my entry is at $89,100, right? So, basically $200 above from where where we are now. So, I'm in around about here. Okay. And my stop loss is at this 89,800. Okay, that's on my stop. I'll I'll look to see if it should have been 900. We'll see. But nonetheless, stop loss in that area over there. So, there is some short opportunities right now. Now, again, the way you kind of do that information, right, is you kind of look at the risk, okay? And then you kind of look at what kind of leverage you are looking at putting in. This one I'm at a 20x at the moment. I'm not too high. I can add a lot more once I'm confirmed and once we're a little bit lower down and I see okay I can move stops down I can add it more. Okay. Now the key is we're at the bottom of the box. Okay. So if you are happy to commit now to okay I'm going to take 5% risk or something like that. It's a nice 5x start right now. Remember the move itself that we're looking for on the drop is anywhere if we look at where we are now anywhere between five and 10%. All right. Right. So, this might be a good start, especially if you haven't tried a lot of Bitcoin like I haven't before, right? New token, you've never really done it much. Some have, that's cool, right? You can kind of work that and remember, you can always build it a little bit more later on as it speaks. Okay? But if you want to get bigger size, you don't have to rush directly into this right now because we are definitely in the bottom half. So, now what I do is I zoom in. I'm just going to show you a quick mindset here. Okay? And I do see we've lost this trend over the last couple of hours and it is telling me that it's very likely Bitcoin is going to push up again in the short term and then we are going to look at the drop right and that for me will reduce your risk a lot and change you from being a 5x to a 8x to a 12x again all depending on your risk appetite right so again if you look at that now it gives me an understanding so for me personally it all depends on your time it all depends deps on like if you can watch the charts for the next few hours but it does seem that will be a lower risk entry uh in the next hour two hours 3 hours um and that can maybe give you a little bit higher more so again it bought this comes what type of aggressive approach are you looking at what you then do as well is when it's going up now okay and it pushes over here you can put this trend in over here this low that we're about to make and what I will do is when we get here I'll maybe add a little bit more. Okay, I'm quite happy with the position at the moment, but let's say you want to open your first position over here. And then when we start dropping this trend, we'll give you a second opportunity to add a little bit more and to actually move that stop loss to this previous high over here, right? Because that will show us now that we are starting to increase the momentum to the downside. Okay, so just going through a couple of plays over there when it comes to this specific short. So I'm going to be shorting this move at the moment. Um and again stop loss is above here because that trap's going to come. It's going to trap the whole market and there'll be some long opportunities on that over there. Okay. Then let's obviously speak around a little bit of where I've worked out TP levels. Um if I look at this bounce zone of where we've been bouncing, right, we're basically bouncing the 786. And what that means is that's that's kind of last support otherwise we're going to go to the lows of where it started, right? So for me the fact that we lost trend is pretty likely if we go down here that we that we won't hold this level but again that trend line will protect me for so we start to break the trend you can take profits a little bit earlier okay but as it stands right now for me back down to the lows okay but I also know that there's a lot of liquidity sitting down in these zones too but for me personally TPS on this trade will be around 85,200 okay then it's the big Right. It's the big long because after that I do see markets really trapping a lot of people and I I see some strength coming in. Okay, again I'm going to TP out. Wait to see that we hold. But then what I have is this daily trend here which we are not far from but we are not far. Okay. So if we look at let's say example today we start to push down into these zones. We then bounce in this opportunity next couple of days. That for me will be a trigger point and this one over here will be a trigger point. I will go through those as setups go. Okay. But from there guys I see us going and hunting into the 100k 102 104 and then if we are bearish we will possibly go down into the 70,000s. If we are bullish we need to get above this big zone of thatund and what did I say yesterday? Let's see that 111,000. Right. And who knows we might catch the bottom and this may happen right big opportunities and then we'll kind of see from there. Um this market can now do anything right and that's something very important for us to uh to understand. Um so again the short is to get the account nice and grown get into nicer um understandings to practice a little bit of the Bitcoin strategies. The risks are a lot lower. Now let's go through the different risks now. Okay. So let's go ETH as an example. So, I'm going to I'm going to go from scratch here, okay? And let's go. There's the daily and then we broke. All right. If we look at percentages of let's say me wanting to short, my short areas will be around this um n 2940 to the areas around 2980. Depends if it's going to go that high. If I look at stop loss, it's up here. It's definitely up in those areas. If I look at the percentage difference, and this is the big big big thing that I want to to obviously explain to you guys. If I had to enter this short right now, my stop loss is around 3% risk, right? Compared to the 1% risk, okay? So, literally a three times difference in risk. Okay? And that for me is what's now aiming me to say, hey, maybe you've been doing it. You know, we've been the best breakout traders on alt alt season, we'll be the best performers. Like that's where we've been. But down markets, we've eaten a lot and this for me has been a very big realization of that. Right? Just if I get something wrong, the fact that one is 1% without leverage and the one is 3% is a very big difference. And this is ETH, right? This is meant to be your second biggest alt and best liquidity within the market. Now again, if we obviously look at reward, the reward's probably a bit bigger, okay? But I don't think we need to focus so much on reward. So yes, the reward where for Bitcoin the first reward is 5%. This one is around 8% and around 12 to 15%. Um between the rewards they're a little bit bigger. Okay, but ultimately the losses, right? The losses is a lot more. Now again, your choice because if you do something if this is a spot short or 1x2x, it's the same equivalent to to shorting Bitcoin right now on a 510X, right? Right? But if you're looking at a little bit more of an aggressive strategy, right, this is the information you can now kind of choose. So again, on ETH, we need to break back in here to be bullish. For now, we're looking at a push down to the lows and then the strength. All right. So, the longs will be big. I might do 10% of my capital on some alcoin longs when we get to these areas over here. Um, but right now, Bitcoin focused only on the short and we'll see where we get. I might not even need alts. If I see that I've 10xed my account in a week, two weeks of Bitcoin alone, then I don't need alts other than long-term um positions, right? Long-term portfolio, I do think alts will perform. Um I just uh need them to go up. Um I think we all need them to go up. Um obviously, if we look at things like uh SUI, so same thing. A lot of charts are showing us losing the bottom trends, right? Right. And the bottom trends over here again we just put this little top of where we've been rejecting. Okay. And we look at where a stop loss would be. This one's also around 3 4%. Right? So I think these are the big things that if we just start changing these slight fundamentals, right? It will give us a good opportunity to say okay so the real skill to wealth is is preserving and losing less on losses, right? I think that's the big thing. I think all of us can win. And the fact, remember I showed you guys that I was obviously trading alts. Als were a little bit stronger two months ago. Um, but there was the one month where I lost 80% of all my trades, but I 4xed my account, right? Which is very interesting stat, right? Out of like 30 trades, I got like six right, but my six were massive and my my losses were quite small. And like that theory keeps going in my head where it's like I imagine your losses are even 30% of what they were then. Your gains will also be probably 30% lower, but the performance could be a lot stronger, right? And that for me it's like the losses are less and my my my wins are a little bit less in percentage wise, I'll still come out with way more, right? And that that for me was a very interesting stat to to to play on. Um so here's things like Soul. Um, this is one token if I was looking to short today, I would possibly not just because of rules, right? This is one token that still is kind of in trend. So, I'm kind of predicting if I short here. Um, again, it does have a risk-to-reward ratio. Okay. And it does look, let's say we had to short this right now. Right. This one's a little bit less. Looks like Soul is one of the stronger than ETH right now. Actually, have a look at that. Remember you can take if you like try to decide between two coins you can kind of look at them against each other. Oh, that's why right if you look at soul to ETH it's actually even started breaking out a nice little possible trend here right Salana is definitely stronger than ETH right now right so that even gives me a better understanding that hey rather wait for the soul long than shorting soul right now um ETH's the weaker one right but nonetheless if I look at this over here this one's on one two% but for me to want to short this I'd kind of wanted to lose here right and this would kind of be the area So, it's important just to know the differences here. And my rules are if we're in trend, you know, you're not really looking for the the the the short. Um, it might even be a token that goes against and it might be a long, right? But for me, again, uh, focused on on Bitcoin. When it comes down to to obviously things like AVAC, I'm not really looking for shorts when I've already seen there's been a whole leg down. Even though this leg could be bigger, right? I'm kind of looking at this thing and saying, \"Hey, that's what's happened. That's what still possibly has to happen, right? You kind of miss 60% of the party, right? So for this, the long is the one that you rather wait for, right? And the way you wait for the long is you obviously look at the key areas. So again, we have this big low over here. And if you zoom out, we have the wick lows as well. See if there's any other data. Okay, so there's some over here. Okay, so there's three areas. This one here, how did I do that? You just go look at previous data. Look at previous highs. So you go here and you'll see there's previous closed highs here and there previous closed highs here. Gives you a couple of areas. Again, your goal is not to predict them, but you know where this thing comes, right? Then we kind of drop in here. The longs are not too far away. That's why for me the market kind of has to start dumping today um or today or especially over the weekend, you know, and if it just goes sideways, you know, then we might be looking at the the longs a bit sooner, right? But for now, if I look at this now, I got to wait for this. But you could see that we drop now to this area here, we then start breaking. There's some big opportunities that are incoming. And that for me is when the risk is going to be at a good area, right? You're looking at a one two% risk on longs in those zones over there. Right? So, as you just go down like here is a chain link at the moment. Also losing trend. Can put that top piece in. Let's actually see what the percentages of this one is. Around two to 3% of where a stop loss would be. renders doing something complete opposite. Now, this could tell you to possibly long, but you got to realize Bitcoin is definitely looking a little bit weaker, right? So, you must keep that in mind. Very important um over here, but for the longs, you could see that this this this altcoin is looking quite uh strong to the the rest of the market. Um so, again, tokens that are still in the trends, I'll be waiting for some nice longs. And obviously when it comes down to the uh the shorts, I'm looking for tokens that are on the other side. So like now, let's zoom in here. Like I said, Bitcoin should bounce, right? Why should it bounce? Because we usually retest and we lose a trend. Okay, so if I look at the last hour, we lost that trend. We started to accelerate. So that means that the short area is here. especially if you want to go a little bit more of the aggressive approach. Okay, so just to put this in here. Why is it doing that? There we go. Okay. Give a nice little idea of where the the the short process. Again, what you can do, you can zoom in slightly, put in this bottom trend. I don't know if the low's in yet. We'll see if this low's in. Um, once we get to the zone, you're looking for the trend at the bottom and that can give you a nice little update on maybe going slightly more aggressive. Um, guys, are you learning? Can we smash the the like up there? Um, just a quick shout out to BDC. They are running a gold rush challenge. Remember BDC is giving you the opportunities um to trade. So, let's go in here. Um, tokenized stocks. So, obviously stocks are ripping all over the world right now. So, you can trade crypto with stocks. And they do have this over here, Gold Rush Trading Challenge. Trade smart and earn gold, right? You see, you get a 10% on your first deposit. Reach your goal, earn up to $24,000 in USDT. And you can see all of this over here, right? Trading volume. You release money. You're trading anyway. All right. So, just giving shout out um to BDC over there. Okay. Let's get back in. Do you guys want to do Let's go through a couple of your tokens. So, let me know what trades you guys are in. Um, and a we can go through a couple of setups of um what we're seeing a little bit of a midterm. Remember high time frame just to go through it one more time so you guys can be aligned when it comes to high time frame. I am personally seeing this. We'll see what happens there. But that that's kind of where my my us going into March, April, you know, Q1, right? Is that kind of play this is the higher low for me, right? Many are going to think 70K. When we get here, many are going to think alltime high. And I think that will be the opportunity if they wanted to go to 70. They would do so. We might even end up breaking new highs like we did last cycle. Don't be surprised. Last cycle, we did it. here after the big drop and the sideways, we actually made higher highs, right? And we actually did have the dominance collapse. Um, so the only thing that for me on altcoin specific is I definitely have my bots and my long-term um spot positions on alts. Other than that, not uh uh not much. Uh altcoins again look like this. They shouldn't go much much lower. So this is quite interesting. I want to show you guys this as well. So I'm speaking about Bitcoin pulling back, right? And obviously paying attention to the shorts in play here. One thing I do want to highlight to you guys is the alts might not go as low. Like so if Bitcoin decides to go to 81,000 84,000, we're expecting like there's new lows of Bitcoin, right? The altcoins might not go as low because maybe their damage is already done, right? So for alts like let's say ETH a bit weaker. So I think ETH can make lower lows, okay? Okay. But if we look at things like let's say soul and stuff like that, we might actually make double bottoms on these alts. And the only reason why is this not showing now. Just save here. Why is my internet not working? Remove our hard work. But anyway, um the the reason why I'm saying this is just keep in mind that we are on a on a midtime frame getting a bit bearish on Bitcoin dominance. Okay, so think about pumps, right? And think about dumps, right, within this market when we have these pullbacks and these things. So we usually follow this model over here. Let me just find it for you guys where this model is. This one here, right? Always speak around when pump starts and we've seen it quite quite um obvious at times. you know, it kind of starts off with Bitcoin, then it moves to ETH, then it moves to this. When it starts with dumps, it works the other way, right? So, what you'll tend to see is you'll tend to see this like, for example, the 10th of um October, right? What did we see? We saw Bitcoin fall from I think 110,000 to like 92,000 and it was back in the 100,000s, right? It it fell like 20 25%. Okay? And then it bounced back, right? Where did the damage happen? Right? The damage happened down here and here. Right. ETH was actually quite strong. ETH fell from 4,000 to like 33 compared to the rest of the market that dropped like 60%. So these two got hit hard on the dump, right? Then fast forward a few weeks later, right? What got hit harder, right? E and Bitcoin made new lows. So, I want to show you guys this here quickly because why I'm trying to say this is why for me the Bitcoin shorts probably one of the the sexiest ones right now because the alts might be overplayed and actually should be paying more for longs. Um, but I want to show you guys. So, when we had this big when was the big uh let's go here. Where's the 10th? Where's the 10th 10th 10th? Boom. Okay. So, here's the perfect example of of what I'm saying over here. Where's the 10th of October? Here. Okay. So, Bitcoin fell from here. I don't know if this is actually showing the wick. Where's the wick? Oh, Bitcoin hardly fell. Okay, but here's the 10th, right? October, big drop, bounced up, right? What happened to damn altcoins in that time? Look at this. Right. Boom. Okay. What got smacked? Right. Avac, chain link, right? Render, right? Algo, right? all of your caps in this category of the lower ones. Right? So, when the dump started, these two got absolutely wrecked. And when it came to Bitcoin and ETH, right? Where's the 10th here? Uh here's the the the 10th here, right? This drop here. Not bad. Okay. Um but then look what happened later. Don't the alts, yes, they started to pull back, but did they make new lower lows? No, they didn't. Right? Till to this day the alts have not made on a lot of the charts made lower lows. So if you look at this over here the low was already set first the flush out was already happening first right who had to catch up these right since then alts are still higher than that wick that happened months ago but bitcoin is now caught up right so it catches up at some point in these things. So the same thing when it comes to the risk-to-rewards of today. I got to keep that in mind that if the Bitcoin dominance is starting to lose these trends here, right? Don't be surprised if Bitcoin and E just catch up to alcoins because alcoins were the ones that have been bruised over the last week or two as well, right? So remember when we are going bullish, we work this way, right? When we go bearish, we work this way, right? But both of them make a lot of sense of where how money kinds of move. So, it doesn't mean that that oh, Bitcoin, let's say it's going to go to 84 now. Soul's going to go to 60 bucks, right? It doesn't mean that necessarily. Does mean that hey, Bitcoin just got to catch up, right? Okay, Maddie, let's go through um some of the altcoins with the squad. Let's do it. Okay, so we're going to go TRX. Is it Tron or TRX? TRX. Okay. Actually quite uh strong. Not bad. Okay. Next. Okay. So, again, I'm going to give you guys if there's any short opportunities and obviously give you guys where I think long opportunities are within these alts. Okay. Let's go next. pipe, which I think's actually been struggling a little bit. Okay, let's go next. Let's do two more Zcash. That one's for Mikey there. Okay. And super divergence. Again, guys, high time frame, I cannot be more bullish on all coins. So, for my long-term spots, I'm just looking at like, okay, if this market don't want to do an alt season in the next three to six months, how am I going to get higher net worth than what I've ever been, right? That that's kind of where my mind's at. Um, you know, but longterm, there's no doubt about it what's more oversold than than uh than else. Um, let's see here. Okay, let's go through. Okay, so let's start off with Tron. So Tron's done actually pretty decent over the last few days going a little bit against the market which is nice. Um looking good. Um a first few things to just pay attention to. So let's zoom out here and kind of see it's it's it's been a good it's been quite a good year for the last two three years for Trump looking really good. So the first thing is keep in mind we are there right? So there is I'm just going to write on the side one thing telling me we're at resistance. Keep that in mind. The second thing is the candle. So when you see a candle has wicked, if this closes red this week, it's very likely that even if we start a little bit green next week, it's very likely we're going to come down and fill that, right? So I must just keep that in mind as well. So So one thing that I've learned, I've been doing quite a bit of business things recently. Why is it doing that? Um, and whenever you want to partner with a business or or you want to do any new adventure, you should actually write down all the worst things that are wrong first and then you write the best things and then you kind of see if you still want to do it, right? So, let's go through. So, the first thing is we at trend resistance. The second thing is candle I got to keep in mind. The third thing is let's have a look at RSI. Okay, we're not completely at the top but we are definitely in the the the the top piece. So I'm not going to give a point for that but we must keep that in mind. Okay the next thing is have we lost momentum right? So if we look at the momentum we were in okay let's remove the top line now and just show you guys. Okay, like that that for me is a little bit not concerning but a little bit like okay like keep that in mind right so that that that's a third thing um when it comes to that over there and there is debate of lower low and stuff like that but I'm going to use these three of that right let's look at good things um oh one more thing that I'll give a point we're still mid-range right so that for me I think good things uh we're in a bull flag we're not breaking out yet but we're in a bull flag so that's at half. Um, RSI is not at the top. That's half. So, maybe one point there. Like, you can already see I'm struggling to to to to find too many of the bullish things. Okay, not to say it ain't bullish. Remember, the pattern's very bullish, right? This pattern could be something like this, right? Even if it did do this, it's probably very bullish for the future. Okay, but if I look at it right now, little bit bare kind of uh uh uh vibes. Um and if I zoom in now, okay, so that was weekly high time frame. Just have a look. If I zoom in, okay, to now for the last week or two and I put this line in, let's see. So there's a two touch, three touch, short touch. Okay, so that can give you a little bit of an answer, right, of what this could possibly be. I put this in here. Oo wow. Okay. So that ultimately we're a little bit lower now, but that that a very good short area if I must be honest. Um we're not confirmed yet, but this is like this might be a little bit more shortish for me like now, but we're quite far from the bottom trend. So this one you don't have to rush into a short. I'd actually rather let something like this happen and if we drop that could be an area. So, just letting you guys know that this high time frame is saying that we had a lot of resistance, right? Um, and for me, there might even be a short. Ain't really just just yet because it's you got to be careful when something's strong, but this is telling me something like this, right? And good buys do look in these areas of these uh um 27 cents, probably even lower down to 25, but we'll work on that as things start to play out. Um, okay, SNX. Okay. So, same problem that the whole market's facing right now is that right? So, there's resistance. Then we have support over here and then we have no more support. Mhm. Imagine you go down an elevator and you don't know how low the elevator goes. Be quite like scary. like it just like there there's just no no idea, you know, you don't know what you're going to open the door to. You don't you don't know, right? Um so something like this um for me obviously it looks crazy oversold on the high time frames. Something like this kind of pop the main trend in um you can zoom in here when we get to this zone here, but I'm quite interested in the next two weeks, three weeks when we're on that side of the line. Then I'd be a bit more interested and say, okay, good opportunities and things like that. There's no doubt about it. It could be a really good project. I don't know too too much about it. I do think I hold a little bit of it. Um it's very oversold. So, there's a lot of money to be made in the future. Um you just don't want to kind of pre end too early unless you're very happy with the investment areas. Uh let's go through hyperlid. Let's have a look. All right. Okay. So, Hyper is actually back at the lows. Crazy, right? This one's starting to to push down quite a bit. Um again it lost that trend that's why we're turning quite bare and you also got to look at levels. So if I look at this as the support right now and then I look at the next support you can see that drop right. So for me this is something I'll be paying attention to. I wouldn't short. I think the shorts are a little bit gone right now. Um but there is $16 and there's $10. You know, these are kind of areas that I would be paying attention to and I'll just be tracking this down as it goes down or the longs. I don't know if I'd be shorting this, right? If I look at percentages now to short 5%, I'm not even going near that, right? To short that right now. You're a little bit late and that's fine. Um, so hype little bit down. It does take a couple of days. We'll have to drop go sidewards. Fake bounce. This side of the trend will be the strength. So, I would say in the next seven 14 days, maybe a little bit sooner. We'll see how fast it drops. I think there's going to be some good uptrades. I'm very bullish on Hyperlquid. Like I think it's one of the new narratives, one of the best in the industry. It's good, right? But right now, it was showing strength when the rest of the market was showing weakness. It's catching up, right? It's catching up. Um Zcash, uh these are the kind of the the the charts and the trades that setups that I made the other day. Um so right now it is looking stronger. It is a token that has had a pullback. Um, we are dead into resistance right now. Okay. So, this isn't something that I would long just yet. Again, for me, let it kind of get out of here and then there is a trade to there. Um, but it's not the big big trade yet. There's still time to the big top trend. So, something that can happen like that and then like that and then kind of go. Um, and what I'll be paying attention to, this is a token that, you know, if I'm looking overall thesis for the day for some shorts, probably not the sexiest token to short unless we get held up here, okay, and we do end up losing that bottom trend. So, let it drop, let it this, and that could be the opportunity. And for longs, that, right? And I if we here I would kind of like to see Bitcoin being hopefully on the other side of the trend for for that uh trend decision. Um super farm someone was saying divergence. I'll go through some divergence. I haven't brought the RSI the relative strength index out in months. I will do that. Um big weekly support here. So I think it's a really good investment level. Um this range is a little bit a 10% range but I think it's a really really good investment level. There's no doubt about it. There was these big spikes of people accumulating this token. Um, so I do think there's a strong future and I do think this could easily be a 10x in the future. Um, right. So this is a little bit more longerterm play. When it comes to trades, I'd obviously be waiting for right now. Let's see. Okay. So again, same problem as all the alts. Right. Now we're on that side. And when it comes to real strength of me taking longs, couple days away, right? Okay, cool. Are we good over there? Guys, remember to join Sniper Club link below in the description. Join it is free for you guys. Click on this over here. Remember to be following me on Twitter. Remember to follow me on Insta and these type of things as well. Where is Bitcoin? Okay, so just clarify again. Let's just go through this one more big time over here. This is the areas of where I'd look for shorts. This is the area of where I'd look for stop- losses. Okay, I would like to track this up. When that trend drops or new lower lows come in, drop the stop loss again. New lows or break a trend. Probably new lows is a good one. Drop your stop loss near entry and um look for flags you'd want to add on the way down, but probably around 84,000 will be the TP areas. Um guys, I'll be back tomorrow with another show. So, I'll see you in 24 hours. We'll get an update from all of this. Um quite crazy to say, only trade our minions in Bitcoin. Have a great day. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye-bye.",
