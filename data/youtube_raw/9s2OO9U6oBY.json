  "transcript": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the cryptoverse. Today we're going to talk about Bitcoin and we're going to provide an update to the bull market support band. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and also check out into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse.com. Let's go ahead and jump in. So, Bitcoin this past week essentially rallied up to the 21week EMA. I don't know if it technically got it. Maybe it did on some exchanges and not on others, but you can see that it it got basically there. So, we talked a lot about how Bitcoin would rally to the bull market support band in 2026, right? And I mentioned back, you know, in earlier Q4 not to expect this rally back up until 2026. You can see that we had a similar rally here in 2022. We also had a similar rally uh in 2018. Now, obviously, I more so compare what we're seeing with 2019. You can also see we had similar rallies up there. We we did break above it at one point. Um, so I I I don't want you to think like it's impossible for something like that to happen, but um I I do think for the most part like the the odds are in our favor of heading back down here, right? Like the odds are in the favor in my opinion of ultimately uh heading back down. mainly not because there's like a lot of people panic selling, but mostly because um we we basically are just kind of topping, as we said, like we've topped on apathy and and I I feel like when you top on apathy, you're not having like retail panic selling, but you're just there's just like a lack of interest in crypto. And so, because midterm years in general tend to be bearish, like I'm not saying they have to be following the prior midterm years. In fact, if you were to look at like the year-to- date ROI of Bitcoin in 2026 and then compare it to say like 2022 and 2018 and 2014, um, it's doing better than, you know, a lot of those prior years. If you were to add the average of prior midterm years, um, Bitcoin is actually doing better. Now, if you look at the ROI from the peak, you can see that also Bitcoin is doing better this cycle than the last several as a function of time. I think it makes more sense to compare to that 2019 where it was just slightly lower lows and slightly lower highs. And so, if we do get slightly lower highs and slightly lower lows going into the summer months and we just kind of go down a little bit, it would seem likely that Bitcoin does eventually end up testing uh this support level down here at around 73 $74,000. But I mean I could be wrong. Uh absolutely. But I I do think that will likely come into play um sometime in the coming months. And you know I mean obviously the big question is is well can Bitcoin rally up to the 50we moving average before that happens. Yeah. Like I mean obviously anything is possible and and and a lot of times Bitcoin does rally up to the 50WE moving average right? You can see it did do that in 2022 and it and it did do that in 2018. It didn't quite make it there in 2014 but it is something that you know that could theoretically happen. So, I I do think in general um what's likely going to happen is that Bitcoin will form a macro lower high. It will then lead into a drop to the prior support level and I think there'll be a bounce there. That doesn't mean the current counter trend rally is over, right? Like I don't know exactly when it's going to end. I just think that a lot of times when you get these three-month drops, you're likely going to get counter trend rallies that last a month or two, right? So, if you look at at monthly returns for Bitcoin, you'll see that we just had three red months in a row and then the current month is currently green in 2021, right? Three red months, two green, and then more red. 2019, three red, one green, and then more red. So there are times, right, where you get these like three red months in a row, and a lot of times it just means the the the current sellers are exhausted. It leads to some new buyers for a little while. But if the buyers are not able to reclaim some of these prior levels uh closer to $110,000, it just seems likely that it will form more of like a macro lower high and then head lower kind of into the summer. And then also remember that a lot of times in the midterm years, sometimes maybe a little bit later, but a lot of times in the midterm years, uh, Bitcoin likes to check in um with its 200E moving average. Right? So you first uh go to the 50, then the 100, then the two, the 50, the 100, then the two. This is 2014, and then 2018, and then you have 2022, the 50, 100, and then go below the two. We've already done the 50. We're now trying to get stay above the 100. If it ultimately fails, I think you watch Bitcoin potentially go into that 200WE moving average. Now, the good news is that 200E moving average is still generally trending higher. Okay, so it it will continue to trend up. Uh the 200E moving average by the summertime will probably be around 64K or or so. You know, it'll it'll continue to climb. Um so, just keep that in mind. All in all, you know, I I do feel like it feels similar. Like the only main difference in terms of feeling is the way we topped. Like I think we topped more on apathy rather than euphoria. Like there's not a lot of retail panic selling. But just because you don't have retail foaming in does not mean you can't have a bare market, right? Like we didn't have retail fomoing in the 2019 top and then Bitcoin still went down for a little while before recovering to new highs. So that's kind of where I think we are. Like I think we're in this phase right now and then, you know, hopefully sort of the next sort of expansion phase will come later. I just don't really think that expansion phase to durable new highs is going to happen um this year. Okay. You know, could it sweep a high? I'm not going to say it can't, but you know, if you look at if you look at things like the RSI on Bitcoin, it's already just been putting in lower highs since March of 2024. Um and you could argue recently this move by Bitcoin on the weekly has just been maybe back testing where the RSI ultimately broke down from. We've seen this happen before. We also saw some similar stuff happen uh in in prior bare markets. So, just keep that in mind. I know this isn't necessarily what people want to hear. Uh but again, I don't control the markets. This is what I think's going to happen. I could be wrong. Uh but just based on what I see in the markets, this is what I think is the most likely outcome. There will be better times in the future. I think this is just where we are right now.
