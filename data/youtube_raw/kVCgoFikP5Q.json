And we're at almost $90,000 right now. >> I don't think this even echoes or rhymes with previous cycles. The only marketing that matters for retail is higher prices. Cryptonative retail is dead and gone. Uber driver and your barber who's like, you know, waiting 3 months for a Binance account so they can finally buy Doge or who's buying a board ape. you know, uh, those people are not here at all. Throughout history, the worst times in history is when speculation was actually the most rampant. >> That thing's written for the banks by the banks. >> I think Bitcoin is the most mispriced asset right now because uh, if it lives up to any meaningful percentage of its potential, it's priced, you know, a tenth of what it should be. >> I know we're going to go to a million within 10 years. So, >> Bitcoin is near $90,000. They're calling it worse sentiment than FTX. Scott says this cycle doesn't rhyme and warns the real danger is when speculation gets most rampant during the worst times. Scott is the host of Wolf of All Streets and Crypto Town Hall, interviewing thought leaders in the space daily. Toby's been in crypto since 2012 and runs Crypto Tips, one of the longest running crypto education channels. So, here's the question. If nobody cares about Bitcoin at $90,000, what happens when the Uber driver finally does? And again, remember, nothing in this video is financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. With that being said, ladies and gentlemen, this is a fantastic episode. You don't want to miss it. So, without further ado, let's bring Toby and Scott onto the stage. Scott, Toby, welcome to the show. Uh we have had both of you guys on before and uh but it's good to see you guys together to get some different opinions and perspectives on how the market's going. I follow both of your content and uh just quickly if you guys are watching this, you enjoy this video, enjoy their perspectives, we'll put their links down below in the description so where you can follow them and and uh watch that if you're interested. So guys, with that being said, you know, where do you think that we are currently in the market? you know, I mean, a lot of people subscribe to the four-year cycle. I think if I think if you look at Ben Cow and he still he still says we're in a bare market. Um, you know, what do you guys think we are right now? >> I I think when you talk about Bowler bear market, you have to specify a time frame because you could definitely argue that this retrace from 1266 is a bare market in and of itself with a 35% retrace. And obviously, you know, some people viewing the price action right now as a bare flag, but I think if you zoom out on any meaningful time frame, Bitcoin is clearly in a uh permanent bull trend and up and to the right with some small retraces in between. I mean, how many times have we seen Bitcoin retrace 30, 35, 40% in the middle of a bull market. It usually happens seven, eight times per cycle. So, to me, this doesn't look dramatically different than any of that. I I think it just depends on your preferred indicator or you know version of analysis that you use. To me, I just see a very sideways market that's looking for direction and has very minimal interest. And that's kind of the the hallmark of one of these periods of consolidation after making a new all-time high on the way up to 126. I think the notion of the four-year cycle is pretty nonsensical at this point. Um, and that's not a a knock on any of the analysts. I get that, you know, there was a Reddit post that said we would talk top on October 6th than we did and therefore that had to be the top of Bitcoin forever. That's sarcasm. I don't really care about that Reddit post. But everything else about this cycle has looked different than previous ones. So, I don't think that you can just look at one data point and say we made a high in October and call it a four-year cycle, even if we continue down. I mean, we had a all-time high way too early because of the ETFs. So, that had broken the cycle already. We never saw any meaningful action across the altcoin market, which is part of the Bitcoin four-year cycle because it's a crypto four-year cycle. Usually, if Bitcoin had made all-time high at 126 and consolidated sideway sideways or at 120 before, we would have seen altcoins exploding across the board and we never even saw a hint of that. So, I don't think this even echoes or rhymes with previous cycles. So, I think the notion that it is a repeat of those is just wrong. And even if you are a huge four-year cycle homer and believe that we now are in a bare market, we didn't even get a 2x from the previous all-time high at 69K by topping at 126. So why would you believe we're going to get a 75, 80 or 90% retrace on the downside? There's no reason to believe we got no upside basically and then get this disport disproportionately huge downside repeating previous cycles. If we only got less than a 2x on the way up, shouldn't 40% down that we've seen be enough for the bare market already? So, I just don't see it right now. >> Yeah, I I I agree. I mean, I I see sentiment the lowest I've ever seen it, lower than FTX. I mean, that's that's fantastic. And we're at almost $90,000 right now. And um wow, that's really great. You know, I've never seen people so miserable and just thinking like I there was a uh CNN uh poll that pulled like you know 21,000 people or whatever. Then again CNN watchers or whatever they said oh 86% of them said no way I'm ever going to invest in Bitcoin. I'm like wow that's that's so good. That just shows me that the tourists are gone, retail's not really here, and the people that really understand this space, understand money are in Bitcoin right now. And the rest are picking their nose or buying silver and gold at, you know, all-time highs or supposed without in the adjusted inflation of all-time highs, even though silver hasn't hit alltime high considering that silver was at $50 back in 1980. you know, it's people are enthralled by high prices. So, the fact that prices are low, that means they're not interested. That's the only thing that interests retail. Yeah. I I want to touch on u something you said, Scott, and you know, I guess in previous bull markets and see, we've always kind of classified if you look back on charts, you say that, you know, 2021, 2020 was like clearly a bull market despite the pullbacks that we had in those markets. you say 201716 like that was a bare market and we just categorized that whole run into one thing despite the pullbacks. I don't know if I ever remember seeing anyone talking about the fact that during those interm pullbacks of 35% 40% maybe I don't remember if anyone was calling that a bare market at the time. Uh but I I I found it really funny that these guys who are doing a lot of TA uh all of a sudden they've created this oh now we're in like a shortterm bare market you know we're like but it's you know it's it to me it seems more like a midcycle retrace in the grander scheme of things. I do remember in 2021 at the time people thought that we were entering a massive bare market and who could blame them if you remember we topped you know Mayish >> that year at 65 and then within weeks were below 30 it was like 14 days or something I don't remember specifically 20 days 14 days it was like a 55% retrace in two or three weeks that felt pretty bare markety but of course then consolidated and sort of consolidated upwards all summer and shot back up 69,000 and then even though that was barely a new high for Bitcoin as I said before the hallmark of that cycle and of previous cycles was then altcoins went insane. >> Yes. >> Right. It was brief. I think people definitely fantasize or have a false conception of how long all seasons lasted that past because uh generally they were very quick just kind of repeated. But if you unless you played them correctly you probably ended up losing money anyways. But I do think people thought at that time we were entering a much bigger bare market, but then were surprised that we went right back up to 69,000. Right? So I do agree nobody was saying we're in a micro bare market within a macro bull market or or anything like that. It's just a very strange time right now. I think that you know the market is fundamentally very different. There's different participants and people have trouble handicapping what that means for the future. And that was also cut short that bull market from Ankor that took down all the lending platforms. So you know who know who knows how high that would have gone. So yeah >> well there was a direct correlation essentially from the top uh when they announced QT and uh essentially that kind of cut things off like that was the kind of end of of new money coming into the system. So they had a pretty direct correlation and that's that's really the underlying reason why when I look at kind of what's happening right now 2025 I think the only reason that we had any upward momentum 2024 2025 was because of the ETFs u but I think without those ETFs like we would have still been in a bare market essentially because it's following how freely available is capital and what's the monetary policy look like how's the Fed acting and uh so from my observations It seems like those things are coming into our favor this year. And uh yeah, I just want to know what what kind of things that you guys are looking at to make a thesis that this year is probably going to be overall bullish for crypto markets. >> I think that Toby echoed something that I say really often is that the only marketing that matters for retail is higher prices. >> Uh you know, I say the best marketing for Bitcoin is price going up and I I think that's absolutely true. So I think there's two buckets of retail, right? and the cryptonative retail is dead and gone because of October 10th and all these repeated liquidation events that we've seen. You're talking about millions of individual accounts liquidated uh over the past few months, right? So, I I can't imagine there's that many more native crypto traders here going player versus player on heavy leverage, even though now we have on a random Tuesday bigger leverage events than FTX entirely. So there's still obviously some there, but I just don't think that there's that many individuals left. But the other bucket is the retail, the Uber driver and your barber who's like, >> you know, waiting 3 months for a Binance account so they can finally buy Doge or who's buying a board ape. You know, those people are not here at all and have not been here at all, I would say, this entire cycle. And they eventually will be if price goes up. So, as sort of cliche as it is, I think the marketing we're going to need is just higher prices, which inevitably will come at some point. >> Do you think that the retail is not here yet? Because, or maybe it's a combination of both, but I guess the question I really want to ask is, do you think that retail can afford to be in this market right now? >> Well, they can afford to bet on the weather tomorrow and to buy silver. So, yes, I think they can afford it. They're just not interested in our thing. >> Okay. It's a it's a really good point and something that I've been wondering myself is, you know, like I'm pretty out of touch with the, you know, I I live in my own little bubble and I don't really know how how affordable things are or how much, you know, disposable income the average American has today. But I guess from what I've kind of heard is it wasn't a whole lot. But I, you know, I guess in the right with the right kind of conditions and the right kind of temptation, people will sell a kidney or mortgage a house or something like that to get into it. And and I think just quickly when people have less disposable income, they're actually more apt to try to gamble to, you know, make a make a living. We saw in the Weimar Republic throughout history, the worst times in history is when speculation was actually the most rampant because, you know, if you're taking, you know, if you're in a hyperinflationary environment, you have a wheelbarrow of cash to go get bread, well, why not try to gamble and and, you know, make your way some real forth turning type stuff. I don't go too deep down the the well of the conspiracy theories, but it does feel like now we're in a world where you can literally speculate on anything in prediction markets, and that's only getting worse. So, yeah, I think if people want to gamble, they're going to find a way, unfortunately. Toby, I I watch your channel quite a bit and uh you know your videos are short, sweet, usually talk about some sort of headline or something like that and then you always encourage people if they want to kind of know what you guys are doing internally to go join your group and you know we we never get to see what's happening inside there. So you know what kind of direction >> I don't know like I maybe I should but >> I'm messing with you. >> Yeah. Um, but I'm wondering, you know, maybe you could just give us a glimpse of of what kind of things you guys look for in there to be able to, you know, give useful advice to your your community members on action because I know that you talk about actionable trades in there and things that you guys do. So >> yeah, >> I think dollar cost averaging, you know, like for instance, we ended up selling when Bitcoin hit or like 30% of our Bitcoin when Bitcoin hit like 110 orund 105 and 110,000. And so what that was when, you know, everybody's like super excited about the Bitcoin president and I'm like, all right, this is getting out of control. like there's going to be a nasty pullback in in my opinion, but I don't know when that's going to happen. So, I took a little bit of profit and then we've been slowly dollar cost averaging in the $80,000 and $79,000 range and I'll slowly buy back once it goes further down. Um, but I mean that's pretty much what we're saying is that I'm at we're in a bull market, you know? I mean, gosh, we're sitting at almost $90,000 and nobody's interested in this space. That's what I look at. I look at sentiment and that really tells a lot because, you know, it's usually retail that just gets that buys the top. So, you can you can read these people like a book, you know, and um especially like Scott was saying before like in 2021 when you know, Bitcoin went from $65,000 to what 32 $31,000 or something like that. That's a 55% pullback. We have gone down 35%. And I'm just I tell people listen we we did that gosh in 2017 2018 I think the we had a 29% pullback four 30 plus% pullbacks and a 40% pullback and then last last bull market was very similar to that with even bigger numbers than that and we still were in a bull market. So that's what we're telling people and I think that a lot of people are going to be also rotating some of those gold and silver you know gains that they've made you know I mean gold added what tr$ 10 trillion dollar in a year on its market cap alone like that stuff is going to go back into crypto I mean I saw it back in 201 from 2012 13 a lot of my friends are like selling gold and or a couple My friends were selling gold and buying buying Bitcoin back then. And that was a really great move because I mean it topped at what silver topped at 50 bucks and then hadn't seen $50 another 14 years later or something like that. You know, it's ridiculous. So instead of being stuck at, you know, with gold and silver at near its all to all-time highs, why not get into Bitcoin that, you know, at least we know that there's a fixed supply there. It's a inelastic asset. So gold and silver or not, because they can just go ahead and, you know, mine more gold and silver. So I I just think Bitcoin is like the premium asset to buy right now. I think it's completely undervalued, especially how much they're printing. And now Trump says they're he's going to give out $2,000 worth of STEMI checks through the uh um part of the um the what is the the tariff uh revenue that they made. You know, what did what did people do back in 2021? They bought they bought alts essentially with their sty checks. So yeah, like like Scott said, you know, regardless how poor they are, they're going to buy and they're all always going to buy near all-time highs. So once price starts going up, people are more interested. You you don't know the drill. And then they're going to that's when you you dump on them. That's unfortunately that's what you do. Um that's just, you know, psychology 101 right there. >> Yeah. About about metals. Uh so Toby, you just kind of gave some uh your uh perspective. Uh are you guys invested in any metals at all? Um and when you see the price continue to go up every day and Bitcoin is kind of, you know, sideways or down, you guys ever think about buying any either silver or gold or, you know, to those who are watching, you know, would do you think uh they would be like a a decent investment at this point or what are your thoughts there? I no idea. >> No, I mean I I the last time I bought silver was back in March of 2020 when it collapsed. So like I think silver collapsed around $10 and so I bought through like Mike Maloney's company, golds.com. I'm not affiliated. Um and you know I sold it about $20. So I doubled my investment there. Um but right now like no way I'm not I'm not touching it. Um, I my father passed me down some 1964s like quarters and dimes and I think 1945 uh nickels which is 90% silver. Um, but that's I'm holding that. I'll never sell that. That's going to be worth a lot of money because that's actually rare. You know, there's very few of that left. Whereas, you know, the mint's always going to have more silver eagles or monster boxes that they'll be able to produce. Um, people say that there's they're they're freaking out because there's no more silver. Trust me, there's a lot of silver out there. Like, you just have to trust central banks that they don't have that much silver or whatever, but they do. So, with that said, I would not buy silver here, gold here. I would simply stick with Bitcoin. That's undervalued and that has horrible sentiment. I don't want to touch anything that the masses are running over themselves to buy right now and lining up to Costco. No way, man. That's not how to invest. >> Scott, how about you? Thanks, Toby. >> Well, first of all, I don't know if you saw the correction, but the tariff uh sty check seemed to have slipped Trump's mind. >> Yeah. Okay. >> Uh he he he gave an interview with four reporters and said, \"I said that? When did I say that?\" So, he literally conveniently forgot about the $2,000 stimulus checks. Not saying he won't do it. I'm just saying very Trumpy of him. Um, as far as silver and gold, I sold recently. Um, you know, my my trader mind says if I'm way up, sell. And if it goes way up, cool. Has nothing to do with me. I I've done my job here, right? And, uh, I think there are fundamental reasons still that they could rise. Um, gold obviously is being bought by central banks for a very specific reason. You can look at the chart and see that central bank holdings of gold has have for the first time in decades exceeded the central bank holdings of United States treasuries. So clearly there's a trend there of countries puking their treasuries and buying gold. So that's a very fundamental serious amount of buying that could continue. So like as a trader I say it looks very toppy right? But, uh, when I when I take a look at it fundamentally, sure, even if it went down 30%, what if gold thing then goes to $10,000? Totally possible. I have no idea. Super happy with the money that I've made, uh, on silver and gold, especially silver, because I feel like I've been holding it since I was born. So, you know, great. Uh, you know, the the the silver bugs are such an angry like contentious community. I had no idea that this was a thing until it went up. They're like worse than the XRP army was when it finally made a move to the upside. It's absolutely astounding to to be quite honest that they're so like emotional, but as Toby kind of alluded to, that's top signal to me. When people start getting legitimately angry at me because I say that their thing might stop going up for a little while, that's usually a signal for me to uh to get out. So, I know I I wouldn't advise buying gold and silver, but I do understand why they're going up. I would push back uh and I've heard the narrative a lot. Toby kind of said it on the idea that that will naturally rotate to Bitcoin. I think I would love to think that and I think in our echo chamber we very much believe in the digital gold narrative and that that should happen but I don't think your average person who's buying silver and gold right now and they get bored naturally thinks that Bitcoin is the thing to buy. I don't know what they're going to rotate into but there's a million assets in the world and I don't know why they would naturally just choose ours. I would love to think they would. Uh, so that's the only kind of point of of contention I would have there. But yeah, generally like if something is going parabolic, I'm not buying it. And if we did get $2,000 stim checks, those people would be buying silver right now. That's what they would be buying. >> What about what about the um the the tax rebates that Trump is going to put out there? I correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the number was on average they said each household would get between 11 and $22,000 or something. Do you guys see that being a big catalyst? >> I don't believe the government. So, no. >> Yeah. I don't believe like like Scott just said, he said, \"What? I said that $2,000.\" I mean, who knows? You never you can't rely on them. >> If if you literally right now it hit your screen and was like, \"United States threatens to take France.\" you'd be like, \"Oh, cool. I guess it is it is Wednesday, so why not?\" I like nothing I I can't even begin to consider anything that comes out of any member of our government's mouth at this point as likely truth because just not I think they say whatever I I think Trump specifically, love him or hate him, just says whatever he thinks at that moment. Uh and it's not like something that's been deeply considered as a legitimate policy that stimulus checks. I mean, what what better example is there than that? People have been talking about how that was going to be a massive catalyst. He doesn't even remember they said it. >> What about the clarity act? Do you think the clarity act would be a catalyst for a space? You think people are maybe, you know, institutions, investors, uh, startups, all these things have been kind of sidelined to wait for more clarity on how they're allowed to operate. I I mean the Clarity Act, gosh, what are they fighting for right now? They're they're literally fighting that thing's written for the banks by the banks first off. And it's and then one of the clauses in there is to keep exchanges from allowing people to use stable coins to generate yield. Like what? H how how are people excited about that? That's ridiculous. Like what? Because banks are so fragile they can't compete. Like I don't I don't get it. The Clarity Act blows my mind. I don't see how that's people are going to get excited about that. I think the passage of the Clarity Act was priced in because it was a foregone conclusion that it was going to happen. I certainly believe that after watching the Genius Act and hearing the rhetoric about it. And so if anything, it's a downward catalyst because I think there's a less than 2% chance that that passes now. I think that one day it will pass. there will be some form of regulation or legislation I should say for uh crypto in the United States government. But if you actually dig into what's happening with it, and I've had some of, you know, the closest the brightest minds that are the closest to the situation that I've spoken to over the last week, Jake Tervinsky, who is arguably the, you know, head lawyer for the crypto lobby, and they're arguing, Chris Perkins today, who's literally close friends with Atkins and Sele, the heads of the CFTC and SEC. And when I talked to people privately at this point who have been close to it, they're like, \"This was never happening.\" Not only did it die last week, but it was never happening. You were nuts to think that it was going to. and I just trust the opinions of others. But as you look at this, it's not just the yield on stable coins, although that has become sort of the red herring that everyone's looking at. To me, that's like, look over here while I'm doing something over here. Um, Coinbase is a convenient excuse for them to say that Brian Armstrong blocked this. So, first of all, Coinbase's self-interest is actually to have nothing happen because the Genius Act is favorable for Coinbase, who currently is able to offer rewards, aka yield, on stable coins on their platform. So, if the banks are lobbying to change that in clarity, it's actually bad for Coinbase to see this go through, right? And that's not a cynical view. I if I was Coinbase, I would be pushing back in the same way, either very clear or let's keep it the way it is because we're making money. But Brian Armstrong has absolutely pointed out a number of other issues with the Clarity Act that I think the two sides are so far apart on that it's very unlikely they'll come together. I mean DeFi would be destroyed with the new language. This is the stuff that we like litigated years ago certainly in through the Gendler era about you know KYCing wallets and DeFi protocols and decentralized protocols and how could you possibly even do that. That's all back on the table. Jake Travinsky told me that this new language that Brian Armstrong pointed out about banning the tokenization of securities that's in the Clarity Act and was added like two weeks ago. >> That's crazy, >> right? That was not in the Clarity Act. There's 130 amendments to the Clarity Act on the table right now. I don't know if you guys are aware of that. Like how far we are at how many different things people want to put in there, but talking about literally you have Paul Atkins with Project Crypto saying we're going to tokenize everything by 2026. the DTCC saying that we're going to use the Canton network to tokenize the entire global financial system by next year and then the Clarity Act is saying we're going to ban tokenized securities. So, we're very far apart there. There's a lot of issues with who's going to control it, CFDC or SEC. But the quiet part that nobody is saying out loud that makes it almost impossible for this to happen is that the Democrats are not going to accept any version of the Clarity Act that allows Trump and his family to trade, capitalize, or participate in crypto. And Trump has very openly said he's not signing any Clarity Act into law that has any sort of ethics clause. So tell me how you're going to get seven or nine or whatever the number is Senate Democrats to vote on a bill that allows Trump to make money in crypto and that he's going to sign that. >> Yeah. >> So it's just not I I just don't see a I was wrong. Like I really thought that it was effectively I didn't look deeply. It's going to get done. They're saying it's going to get done. They're all at the World Economic Forum right now saying it's going to get done. I don't see the path. I mean, how would how would it affect DeFi? I mean, how would they enforce how would they enforce this? Because that that's really interesting be because I mean like are they going to you know, you have a and there's there's a lot of DeFi protocols that I don't know how are they going to touch that? >> They can't. That that was always I think that was always the argument, right? It was like you're putting requirements on protocols and entities that literally could not comply with those even if they tried their best, right? There's literally no way that like a self-custody wallet can KYC its customers. Just not possible. >> Yeah. So, probably w with with the Clarity Act, you know, regardless of of whether or not it passes, I still think we're going to do fine. And then retail is going to come in regardless. They're not going to come in due to the Clarity Act. Retail doesn't come in due to I mean, if if you're looking at retail, maybe you're looking at institutional, that's different. But for retail to, you know, to have that blowoff top, they're the one that that are going to create that, you know, >> you know, Kyle, I think it's a problem for anything that doesn't get like the regulatory stamp of approval. I was talking to Chris Perkins about that this this morning, and I think it's really becoming a world of halves and halves. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Salada, XRP, HAR, you name it. If you've got an ETF in futures, you're probably good to go. But if you're coin number 74 on Coin Market Cap and institutions can't participate and you don't have the clarity from, no pun intended, the Clarity Act, you might be kind of screwed. Yeah, it it does almost feel like if it's delayed or delayed indefinitely for the upcoming kind of liquidity season, it might even be in the best interest of every everyone to keep that, you know, from passing at the moment because what you what you're not seeing right now, what I'm not seeing anyway is any more SEC enforcement, uh, you know, regulation by enforcements. So there I think everyone's kind of waiting to see how that plays out. uh which means there's maybe a bit more of an easy path for people to kind of operate on guidance from Paul Atkins and his kind of token taxonomy framework he built out and you know what can you really say the SEC and things like that to people who are you know the the Coinbases of the world who are launching retail ICOs you know they're the biggest crypto company in the world essentially or in America doing retail facing ICOs you know like that is something that I never thought I would see but this has happened before clarity act and probably just based on kind of guidance from what we're seeing from the chair of the SEC. Yeah, I think there's an argument to be made uh which I've heard others make that if we don't get clarity but we have three years of extremely bullish regulatory precedent that could be fine, right? Like I mean I would kind of push back and say that you know executive orders get reversed the day that a new president comes in so we could throw those out. And we saw Gary Gendler effectively go after every single entity in the crypto industry try to basically you know regulation by enforcement and all that was reversed the second that there was Hester Purse and then later Paul Atkins and we saw a new SEC. So I think that regulation and executive orders and such can be reversed. But we do even regardless of midterms, we do know that the head of the major regulators are very pro Bitcoin and crypto and will do their best to at least not overregulate the space. So maybe that could set precedent and be good. But to your point, like I think I heir towards the uh bad regulation, I mean bad legislation is better than uh is worse than than no legislation at all. This is like, you know, this is if they pass the Clarity Act as it is, this is a hundred years of dealing with the unintended consequences or intended unintended consequences cynically of what's written in there. So, it has to be right or we might as well just uh pass on it entirely. >> Yeah. America's been a very confusing place to operate and exist in to do crypto. Toby, you've you uh and Heidi expatriated, I believe, right? I'm curious on, you know, your thoughts on what's happening in America and um, you know, how you feel now being an outsider of of what's going on in America, like what has that done for you guys personally? And then, uh, do you still feel do you still pay attention a lot to what's happening in America because of the fact that the policy and things that are created in America tend to affect the markets overall? I mean, I I could see it back in 2017. 1617 was when I saw the US government kind of cracking down on crypto, especially putting, you know, US citizens in their little tiny box called like Binance US and the rest of the world could use binance.com. That was just a little taste of what was to come. and then, you know, seeing uh yeah, just a lot of red red tape and regulation coming down the pike. And so we decided to leave. We're like, \"All right, I'm I'm done with this fact, FBAR, all that stuff.\" I'm like, \"No, I don't want to deal with that.\" And so, yeah, living in, you know, like Portugal, it's it was taxfree. like we just happened I moved here for the waves and it happened to be taxfree um for crypto until last year and then they started saying okay you have to hold your crypto for one year and then it's taxfree okay cool and um so it's been fantastic and you know seeing what is happening in the United States with the debt load just keep rising you know people have never been so divided I've never seen people so divided And I I I always think that maybe it's because what I'm seeing on Twitter, but then I ask my friends, they're like, \"Yeah, since you left, it's a completely different country.\" I'm like, \"Really?\" And and then I guess it's we never had the woke agenda even back when I was over there, you know, which is crazy. I would never want to have a kid in a school where they're teaching that crap, you know, and then you have all the shootings on a weekly basis and I'm just like, you know what? Nah, I'm I'm done with that. Have fun. I'm going to live in a peaceful country and you guys can deal with that if you want. But, um, yeah, it's been fantastic. You know, food's great here. It's not poison like in the US, as you know, now whole world's kind of waking up to that fact. And, um, now that the government's flipped the the the food pyramid upside down, I don't give them any credit because people are just catching on. They can't lie anymore. So, they're like, \"Okay, well, I guess you're right. So maybe we'll we'll just have to admit we were wrong. So it's just like >> was the biggest scam in the history of I mean growing up thinking that white bread was one of the forefruit >> Yeah. Right. And they kept it till like a couple weeks ago. Like what the heck man? You got to be kidding me. >> Wonder all the nutrients. >> Yeah. Exactly. So it's been great. Yeah. It's great keeping most of your money. Uh especially in crypto. I've never paid I haven't paid taxes in a long time on crypto. It's been fantastic. >> The problem is nobody in the United States has either because it requires gains. >> Oh, it does. Yeah. Right. They're done. What is it like 70% don't even decide? >> Since you left, uh, nobody left for no reason except for the amazing waves and the >> Sure. So Toby, um, you know, I I was, uh, I think it was probably about three years ago, two, three years ago, I was I was on I was on the path expatriating. I had um, you know, working with uh, a couple a different, you know, a legal firm. We're looking at everything and uh, maybe it was just two years ago actually, and then I didn't go through with it. uh for whatever reason, I don't remember. I think it was maybe because America was promising to be the crypto capital of the world when I saw that early and thought maybe I should just wait a little bit longer and see how this goes. Uh but I have I do have a dual citizenship. I'm French and American. But, you know, I I'm I'm guessing that, you know, it it's probably more more relevant for people who make a good amount of money and people, you know, have been in crypto for a long time and and think that, you know, their net worth is going to continue to increase from crypto holdings and the overall trajectory of the market overall, you know, on a scale from like 1 to 10, how satisfied are you guys with with making that decision? And do you also have is there anything that you felt like you sacrificed uh from giving up US passport like maybe it's global security or whatever else it might be? >> Sure. I mean well first off we renounced during a bare market so we didn't really have that much. We took out enough for our renouncement and and our passports for St. Kits and Neas. And um it was a tough decision, you know, like it's not something that you just wake up and go, \"Yeah, I'm out of here because this or that president.\" Now, we didn't do that because of that. We actually didn't really do it too much because of taxes as well either. Um we we did it because, you know, the headache that we have cuz we live overseas and all the reporting standards and starting up companies and actually I started up, you know, I started a business in Dubai. We bought property in in Switzerland. Both of those places, if you're a US citizen, I mean, especially uh if you're buying property in Switzerland, you can't like you just can't. They needed a certificate of renouncement before they even started any process of opening up a bank account over there. With Dubai, they're like, \"Okay, are you sure you're not a US citizen?\" Yes. They just that's the number one thing every country asks if you're doing business, opening up a bank account, are you a US citizen? because they don't want to deal with most US citizens. Um, and so it's been really nice. As far as the um the sacrifices, I mean, I can't vote anymore. It sucks. >> I cannot vote for the president that I wanted. I can't couldn't vote for the Bitcoin president. >> That's like a gift. >> The the actual sacrifice is not being there with my mother. Um, but she comes out all the time. She loves visiting me, me and Heidi. So, it's it's been great and so is her parents as well. Um, but as far as like anything else, I don't really miss miss it too much. I miss Hawaii a little bit, but you know, I'm Ger I have a German citizenship through um descent, so I can go just with a ESTA and visit. So, it's not that hard. >> Cool. Okay. even though I haven't been back since. >> I I heard that uh it's not uncommon to get um you know some trouble as an expatriot coming back into the states sometime just because they like to mess around with people done that. >> Have you been back since then? >> No. No, >> no, >> no. >> So, speaking of of uh geop like geopolitics and and the states, uh what is your guys take? I guess I was, you know, be spec specific to Greenland, but I think it's it's, you know, extends beyond that because Trump has like called out Cuba, Mexico, um I think Colombia, right? And so I, you know, he definitely wasn't in any of his campaigning material about, you know, uh, you know, taking out Maduro and demand, you know, really demanding Greenland and, uh, threatening Cuba and I think Colombia and >> Yeah. So, is this going to be something that we kind of all just get used to and and then uh, like it's not, you know, it doesn't have big market swings moving forward or >> I have great news for you, Kyle. >> Okay. >> Really, you're awesome. You're a dual citizen of the United States and France, you said. >> Yeah. >> Soon you'll be just one citizen. >> Yeah. >> We're gonna take that. That's ours. >> It's a good 57th state by the time we get there. But uh uh yeah, I I think that uh we've normalized insane rhetoric. Yes. Like I I have a >> very big problem with what happened in Venezuela. I'm very happy for the people. I think Maduro had to go. But you can that people have lost all nuance it seems. But you can be happy that a dictator is no longer in power but question the right of the United States to be the ones to do it right and uh and believe that the future of Venezuela should be in the hands of Venezuelans and you shouldn't have the president of the United States uh truththing or tweeting I guess we call it truthing pictures of himself as the acting president of Venezuela. Right. So like if you think that he won't do it he's done it >> right. So, I guess you have to take it somewhat seriously, but yeah, I I don't uh think we should be an imperial nation, personally. Uh, and so, yeah, I think uh we're going to be hearing a lot of these things. Uh, and the crazy is probably just going to get crazier. I kind of just envy Toby floating out there without his phone uh riding giant while we're uh watching. >> And they also just acquired 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela. So, let's see what they do with their gold and silver and and all their rare earth metal metals and yeah, Bitcoin. So, yeah, it's kind of how horrible. >> People scream at me that I have GDS. It's so disturbing because like I I had way worse BDS like in the last four years. Like I guess if you can have Biden derangement syndrome, I just really thought that the whole reason that we bitcoined was so that we could be like Toby and opt out. >> There you go. Well, you still can, right? >> Yeah. I feel like that's ailiated. >> Yeah. The problem is so that the problem is with, you know, with renouncing your citizenship, as you said, you did it in the depths of bare market, which is the right time. But to to my understanding, if you have any sort of meaningful wealth, they basically chase you for 10 years and you pay a huge exit tax anyways. So, there's really like by the time you're done, there's very little benefit to leaving if you have if you're over a certain threshold. >> Yeah. That's called a covered expat. So, but you got to see accountant for that. See if you actually owe anything. They can do some things. >> So, >> yeah, they can. Like, like Kyle said, it just seems like uh you know, you don't want to be Roger Ver. >> No, but I think he owed a lot of taxes that he didn't pay. So, >> yeah, it was from Bitcoin. >> It was his companies from America that were that were not paying taxes, not him personally. Yeah. But >> Toby, were you a German citizen by birth? >> No. No. I had to apply for that. Um I cuz my grandparents fled Germany in the ' 40s or my grandparents fled Germany in the 40s and um they lost their birth certificate. They didn't really have any proof that they were um that my mother was part of them, you know what I mean? And so I but I did find the boat that they they took from Shang I think it was it was China to um to San Francisco. So I found their name and I'm like wow. So I sent it over to the German embassy, waited six years and finally got it. >> Holy Um >> so wait, are your parents uh American or German or >> Yeah, they're they're American. Yeah. >> Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What I had heard, Scott, was that uh you know, in some cases there's an exception for people who uh were another like a dual citizen by by birthrights. >> Yeah, that makes sense. >> Not having to pay that 50% exit tax. And then I I also heard I don't want I don't want to get too uh >> Yeah, whatever. But like I also heard that once you kind of exit, they don't really chase you for the next 10 years. I don't know, Toby, maybe you can shine some light on that. Uh I heard that they they you know really come hard on the exit but um but yeah I guess technically you're still responsible from taxes for 10 years out or something like that. >> No no if you're a covered ex expat you are. Um I was not. I had under the threshold. Um I did it a really good time and um paid the taxes taxes and um and left and that was it. But if you're a covered expat yeah you might owe taxes for a certain amount of time. I don't I'm not really sure because I never dealt with that. >> What does that mean? Cover tax bet. >> It means that either you're you made over a certain threshold per income per year or you didn't pay your taxes on time as well. So you had some outstanding debt and um I forgot what the last last one is but yeah if you fall under those things then you are going to be more stringent like looked at a little more strongly and um yeah but you can obviously see an accountant for that. It's kind of hard to find an accountant to or a lawyer to help you out with that stuff, but you know, we found one and to make sure we did it all good. And uh it's nice. It's not nice not looking over your shoulder, you know what I mean? >> Yeah, I think it's over two million bucks. I just I just use my brain aka chat GPT. >> Um when it says, yeah, over $2 million or average annual US income tax liability over 190. And then as he said uh you know you have to be tax compliant for the pri prior 5 years. So it gets pretty ugly pretty fast if uh you have assets they are not going to look kindly on you. >> Yeah. >> You know taking those with you in in full. >> Okay guys. So I'm just going to do a a quick rapid fire round. Just I'll ask you guys a question. Just a real short sweet response. Uh kind of whatever comes to your mind first. Uh so Scott, what is the most mispriced narrative in crypto right now? Is it like Bitcoin is collateral, ETH is a productivity layer, alt beta or something else? >> I think Bitcoin is the most mispriced asset right now because uh if it lives up to any meaningful percentage of its potential, it's priced a tenth of where it should be. >> Yeah, agree. Uh Toby, over the next six to 12 months, uh what framework actually matters for Bitcoin and crypto? Is it liquidity, real usage, regulation, or something else? >> As far as like the price to go up, >> yeah, exactly. pay his first price. >> I mean, you're I think inflation is going to get ridiculous and I think people are going to not have any other place to put their assets or put their money but to Bitcoin and maybe gold and silver if they want to. >> Yeah. Uh, agreed. Scott, what's one indicator you trust most that risk is truly back? And what's what is the indicator everyone obsesses over that you think is basically noise? I think that risk has been here the whole time. I just think it hasn't found its way to crypto this time. Yeah. You know, you can see that even when the mag seven retraces, you see the Russell, which is small caps in the stock market going to all-time highs. I mean, everything except for crypto is up. So, I don't think we need risk to come back. I just think we need interest in our thing to come back. >> Makes sense. Yeah. Toby, what's the biggest mistake you expect smart investors or any investors to make this cycle? Is it rotating into alts too early, unders sizing positions in Bitcoin and ETH? Uh, or something else? >> Oh, yeah, for sure. I think that that smart investors are going to try to leverage um open interest is going to rise and they're just going to get liquidated and so just probably best to dollar cost average on the way into Bitcoin and ETH. And don't play with leverage if you don't need to. Yeah, exactly. That's one of the things I talk about on a regular basis. >> It's been Yeah, almost I think almost nobody's made any money with leverage except for these >> these these accounts that we see on X where it's this insider who's made 100x hasn't lost a trade in forever. >> Sure. >> Probably Baron, you know. >> Nancy Pelosi. >> Yeah, Pelosi. Definitely. Scott, do you think that we're going to have like do do your signals and your your kind of uh yeah, your uh sensors believe that liquidity is going to come back in full swing this 2026? Uh and if it doesn't, what do you think happens? >> It it's interesting because I think they want liquidity to come back heavily this year for sure. The midterm elections are coming. We know that they're willing to run the government hot. they entirely gave up on the idea of Doge and austerity and balancing the budget and all the kind of uh ideas that we had >> early on. We know that the government is going to print massively. So, I do think that a lot of liquidity is going to come in. I'm just not quite sure where it's going to come in from and where it's going to land. So, like there's a lot of ways that liquidity can enter the financial system without that liquidity landing on chain link, >> right? So I like I and I keep hearing the very strong narrative of the business cycle ramping up. Tom Lee and Ra Pal and these guys talking about it, but it's been flat for years. >> Yes. >> And everyone said it was going to go last year and it didn't. So like markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. So what's to say that we won't just have another flat year uh of liquidity? I also think that Fed rate cuts mean effectively nothing at this point. And I think if there's going to be liquidity, it's has to be fiscally driven and not monetary policy because I just don't think anyone really deeply cares about the Fed at this point or that it's meaningful. So I do think liquidity will come in. I just am not sure liquidity will come to retail. >> Mhm. Yeah. Well, well said. Uh Toby, the market cycles do, you know, is it I believe earlier we talked a little about four year cycle. Maybe that that's dead. maybe it should have never existed. Uh do you see this particular cycle lasting into the end of 2026, 2027? Do you think that how the market structure becomes different moving forward? Anything like different than that? You know, like maybe there's no more clear >> volatility will be way less. Um I mean, we're already seeing it this this bull cycle. We've only had what two 30% maybe three 30% drops. That's about it. Something like that. This was the the biggest 35% drop so far. And it's been a long time since we've been in this bowl. So, man, I I I don't know. I really don't know. I don't think anybody knows. But what I do know is that the best way to go forward to this is I I'm very repetitive on this, but dollar cost averaging, I don't think you can go wrong. You know, I think like instead of going all in like a lot of people go, \"Oh, I need to buy Bitcoin. Just blow it all in one trade.\" No, no, no, no. Just chill. You're always like, you know, dollar cost average on the way down because we don't know how low we're going to go at this this point right now. And I don't really care. I know we're going to go to a million within 10 years. So, who cares what what goes on in the next, you know, three, four months? I I don't I don't really care. >> Cool. All right, guys. Thank you so much for coming on today, Scott, Toby. It's been a pleasure. Learned some new things. Guys, again, if you got in value from this, uh, you know, make sure that you follow these guys on their socials. I'll leave the links down below. Um, yeah, thank you guys. >> Yeah, thanks. really appreciate.",
