  "transcript": "Hey everyone and thanks for jumping back into the heavy metal verse. Gold has now broken out against the stock market. If you guys like the content, make sure you subscribe to the channel, give the video a thumbs up, and check out ITC Premium at into the cryptoverse.com. Also, check out the new website.com. We have a lot of other things over there if you're looking more for direct access. Let's go ahead and jump in. Gold on the USD pair is continuing to go higher. 4,900 uh currently 4922. Obviously 5K is a big round number. We have seen things struggle at these levels. We saw Tesla struggle to break through 500. We saw Ethereum struggle to break through 5,000. Hopefully gold can break through. But here's the bigger chart. The bigger chart to watch is not the USD valuation. It is the valuation against the stock market. And the reason for that is because if you have cash, you want to figure out where to put it. Obviously, things will get corrections, right? Like I've said before, I expect uh a a top sometime in the first half of this year followed by a low late Q3, early Q4 by Metals. Um that seems reasonable. But what's more interesting is what's going on on the S&P valuation because gold is breaking out against the S&P 500. Now, I've already shown this chart in other ways. We've looked at it the reverse where you look at the S&P divided by gold, and you can see that it looks like it is starting to break down here. Is it a fake out? I guess we'll find out. But to me, it's really starting to look like gold is breaking out against the stock market and that the stock market is breaking down against gold. This pattern is a pattern we have seen. We've seen it play out over so many different charts and and I think it's probably going to play out again. The first chart being we saw this first on Bitcoin dominance many years ago. We're going to work it in. Who would I be if I didn't, right? Where Bitcoin dominance eventually broke higher, got a correction, continued to run. We saw it with HSI, the Chinese markets. We saw the same thing play out over there where you had, you know, you had these highs, eventually it broke through, got a correction, continued to run. You even see it on USDT dominance plus USDC dominance, right? And maybe I should look at it on the weekly time frame so you can at least see a little bit clearer. But you basically have the highs, it eventually breaks out, drops, and then continues to run. Where else do we see it? Glad you asked. We saw it on palladium. Palladium, same similar idea, right? Set some highs, break through, pullback, continue to run. Gold versus the S&P, it already got a big pullback not too long ago, and now it's breaking through. So, it looks like things are changing. the structure is shifting. Will gold have a correction? Absolutely. At some point it will. Most likely going it'll probably start before Q3 gets here and I'm guessing it'll find a low in Q3 Q4. But here's the thing. Do you guys remember with crypto how I would always say the same thing over and over and over again? I would say altcoins are not a great investment because no matter the direction of Bitcoin, they're going to go down, right? Also go down no matter the direction of Bitcoin. And then it was hard to believe in the time for a lot of people, but you zoom out so many years later and you can see that the altcoin market bled against Bitcoin. No matter the way that Bitcoin went, altcoins just continued to bleed against Bitcoin. Now, I say the same thing, but with respect to gold, right? Stocks will likely bleed to gold no matter the direction of gold. If gold goes up, stocks bleed. If gold goes down, stocks bleed against gold. That doesn't mean stocks can't go up on their USD pairs. It just means they're likely going to be bleeding against gold. That is the regime that we are in. Right? So, when you look at gold divided by the S&P, you can see it's breaking out. I'm sure there's going to be a pullback at some point, but as I said before, who cares, right? Who cares? Yes, it will. But if you want to be invested somewhere, gold continues to outperform a lot of the other investments. Um, and again, you don't have to hate an asset class just because it hasn't done well in prior years. It's okay to pivot, right? And I I say this month after month, year after year. I said back in 2022, I was pivoting pivoting away from altcoins. And what's crazy is if you look at the valuation of altcoins against gold, they're about to put in a new low from where they bottomed in 2023. They're about to put in a new low. Guess what? Against silver, they already did put in a new low. So, yet another example of trade the market you have, not the market you want. A lot of people found me via crypto. I used to be bullish on altcoins back in 2019, 2020, and 2021, but the reality is ever since then, they've just been bleeding against lower risk assets, right? Don't get mad at me. Don't get frustrated at me because I'm not just blindly bullish on what's essentially just back office software for a lot of these altcoins. Trade the market you have, not the market you want. And the biggest mistake people make is they sell their winners to buy the losers. Right? And then also the thing that I have to remind myself of is don't be a hero trying to predict exactly when these trends are going to change. You know, and I say that over and over and over again. And the the issue that a lot of people fall into is that they had no ability to to to sort of see that all would bleed against other things like Bitcoin and gold and stocks, but they think they know when it's going to end. So don't fall into that trap. It's an easy trap to fall into. Momentum is a hell of a drug. So gold's now at 4920. You can even see palladium is is back above 1900. Silver is in 96. Uh uranium's moving up. lithium, nickel. I mean, commodities in general are are moving higher. And it just goes to show you that there's always a bull market somewhere. No matter the market conditions, you could argue there are places in, you know, areas you can go to make money. You just have to not marry an asset class. I've told you before, don't marry an altcoin, but also don't marry an asset class. There are times when metals are going to outperform everything else. There's times when stocks are going to outperform everything else. There's times when bonds are going to outperform everything else and there's times when crypto will outperform everything else. We're not in the time where crypto outperforms everything else, right? We're in the time where metals are outperforming. So, trade the market you have, not the market you want. You can't expect your favorite asset class to always be the thing in the lead. It's not going to work like that. Okay? We go through these cycles. My guess is crypto is going to find a low whenever gold finds a low. The problem with that is gold's not even dropping yet. So, in order for crypto to find a low, metals have to find a low. But, as long as they keep going parabolic, it's hard for me to talk about a low for crypto because I think that crypto might b them after gold gets a correction and then finds a low that it can build off of potentially late Q3, early Q4. So, when you look at gold against the stock market, you can see it is it looks like it's wanting to break out. Will there likely be a pullback at some point? Yeah. But it's an opportunity, right? like it'll probably just be an opportunity as this chart just continues to go higher again every week, every month, you know, day after day, week after week, month after month. People say this is the top for gold against stocks, but it just keeps going higher. And I think that trend is going to continue uh for probably several more years if I had to guess. And I am guessing. That's what we do here. We speculate dubiously. Of course, in terms of a high for gold, I think what you have to look at is you go to something like the maybe like the year-to- date ROI of gold and perhaps you start there and say, \"All right, well, let's just look at what gold did in other midterm years and see if it's any see if it's comparable.\" Look at 2022. You can see what gold did. Ma massive spike and then sort of a drop into Q3, early Q4. What did it do in 2018? went up a little and then drop into late Q3, early Q4. Way to do in 2014. Same thing. Same thing, right? So, I would look for a high probably in the first quarter for gold. I would expect it to lose some interest going into Q2, but not crash outright, then maybe drop a lot more into Q3, find a low, and then build off that going into 2027, 2028. That's my view on gold right now. It is in fact breaking out against the stock market. This is probably the very beginning um of this breakout. I I don't think it will stop anytime soon. I think you'll have a pullback and then it'll keep running. And even then, remember we talked about USDT dominance plus USDC dominance getting a pullback and then continue to run and it did, right? It got a pullback. I don't know if it's done pulling back yet. It could always come back down one more time, but after this is over, it should move higher into the summer months. Those are my views. Thank you guys for tuning in. Make sure you subscribe. Give the video a thumbs up. Again, check out into the cryptoverse premium at into the cryptoverse.com, but also check out the new website that we launched. Um, I also launched a report recently about crypto, a crypto macro risk memo. Kind of explains what's going on in crypto right now. And if you are interested in in kind of understanding why crypto is bleeding, why it's likely going to continue bleeding into the summer, make sure you guys check out that report. Uh, link will be in the description below. Thank you guys for tuning in. Subscribe. I'll see you guys next time. Bye.",
