  "transcript": "Bitcoin just ripped from the low of 92,000s to basically 97.5K in one session. And the question everyone wants to know is, is this a real breakout that starts the next leg up or is it the cleanest fake out you're going to see all year? This move is happening right as institutions just slammed the gas pedal. We just saw the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in months, roughly [music] 3/4 of a billion dollar. And tomorrow morning in Washington, there's a crypto market structure bill on the deck. The Clarity Act that could change how the entire market gets regulated. So, let's answer that question. We are all wondering, the next leg up or a fake out. And guys, if you excited to learn about this, if you appreciate the alpha, do me a favor, like the video, subscribe to the channel if you're not already. What's up? My name is Kyle. Let's get into it. In the next 10 minutes, guys, I'm going to give you a non-hopium, no doom framework, three signals that tell you if it's a breakout, three signals that scream if it's a fake out, and two price levels that decide who wins and who becomes exit liquidity. Welcome back, guys. If you like fast, high signal macro in crypto, you're in the right place. And guys, as always, a quick note. This is not financial advice. I am not your financial adviser. I'm just some guy on YouTube telling you how I'm looking at the markets. All right, guys. So, this pump has three engines, and you need to know all three to judge whether it's sustainable or not. Engine number one is spot demand through ETFs. Yesterday's spot ETF inflows weren't just positive, they were violent, and it wasn't a single fund anomaly. It was a broad-based across all the big products. Yesterday was actually the second day of positive inflows in a while, but it was massive. As you guys can see here, $753.8 [music] million inflows across all the product offerings. Engine number two, macro gave risk assets oxygen. Inflation didn't reacelerate. CPI came in with the headline and core still in that well at least things aren't getting worse zone. And that matters because crypto is still trading like a high beta liquidity asset. Then you've got engine number three. Regulation headlines are finally acting like a catalyst again. The market is sniffing something it hadn't had in a long time, a path toward rules. But, and this is key, headlines can start a move, they don't finish it. So, we have to ask, is this move being carried by real spot buying or is it mostly leverage and short covering? And guys, here's where we need to get brutally honest. When Bitcoin jumps this fast, there are only two ways it happens. Either real money buys spot and refuses to sell, or leverage gets forced, shorts get liquidated, price jumps, and then it fades. But right now, the data, well, it kind of says it's both. But the move has a short squeeze backbone. Open interest is up meaningfully in the past 24 hours. Leverage is building. It is not cooling. Funding is positive across the board. Longs are paying for that leverage. Liquidations are heavily skewed to shorts, meaning bears got wiped out. And here's the takeaway. Short squeezes can become real breakouts, but only if after the squeeze, spa demand keeps showing up. If the ETF bid continues, the squeeze becomes a launchpad. If ETF flows stall and leverage stays crowded, the market loves to rug both sides. We've seen this relentlessly where we chop sideways for what feels like decades. Let's talk clarity act because this is the narrative everyone's tweeting about right now, but almost nobody is framing correctly. Tomorrow is a committee, a markup executive session. That's not the law will be passed. It's a step in the process, but it's a serious signal that policy momentum is alive. At a high level, this is about defining when crypto assets are treated like securities or commodities and it's looking like mostly commodities and clarifying who regulates what with more emphasis. That's why I just said commodities towards the CFTC on spot markets, which is what I care about the most and tightening that conversation around stable coin rewards and interest mechanics. But why does the market care? Well, institutions don't need perfect regulation. They need enough clarity to deploy size without stepping on a landmine. But here's the trap. Buy the rumor, sell the news is real, especially when the catalyst is political. So, if we pump into tomorrow and the headlines hit that are less bullish and opium, the market could snap back fast. Now, let's talk levels because this is where the answers live. Right now, the market is fighting over a few zones. So, level one, guys, let me show you. This has historically been a place where we can call right now, at least in the past few months, the line in the sand, the area that we need to hold to claim and not say this is going to be a dead cap bounce. Let me show that to you on the charts over here. So as you guys can see there's actually you know since really it broke below this has got to be from the October crash carrying over till we kept going down and down and down and we can see that this blue line I drew over here essentially boom try to break through it try to break through it try to break through it finally broke through it this is anywhere you know between 94 $95,000 zone and for at least for now we've clearly broke through it this is on the 4hour chart we actually got a retest of it and bounced it up higher but there's also another level we're looking at very very closely right now and we are just currently at time of recording sitting right there. This is the 50w week exponential moving average and you can see right now this has been holding the trend line super carefully and right now what we need to do to break this downward trend is actually break and hold above this $97.5,000 level. I'm really comfortable sitting at about above 95,000 treating that as resistance but this is what a lot of traders will be looking at as well. But Kyle, you are not a trader. Why are you talking about this? Because I want to know which general direction which actually directionally which way we are headed in the markets? Because we have been chopping sideways for what feels like forever. You guys know that. But this is the first time we're getting some real momentum essentially since that horrible October 10th capitulation event. And yes, that was a capitulation event. People do say that they expect things to go much much lower before they get better. But in my opinion, because October 10th was even worse than FTX when it comes down to how much money people actually lost, the liquidations, everything like that, that could have been the final catalyst down. We could have been seeing it right around here. Now, of course, if you're trading right now, I'm making this video because you should be extremely careful with leverage. Now, the reason I showed this buy chart initially was because I'm very, very excited. You guys know who've been following the channel for a while that I'm using the only way that I'm trading with leverage for the past 10 months has been through sequence. There's a link in the description below, guys. And yes, I am talking about them because why they've done so well for me. If you guys would like me to do a video exclusively on Sequence, let me know below. Also, we have the USD accumulation strategy that I can cover in that in that video just for sequence. But guys, if you want to sign up, the link in the description below. It's been absolutely awesome. Look, it's automatically trades for me. It's only leverage that I do. It's light leverage. So, back into things. The number the third place is the psychological level of $100,000. That is a psychological wall. Above $100,000, sentiment completely changes. Headlines change, position changes. So, here's the blunt truth. So, if Bitcoin solidly breaks above that $97.5,000 mark and starts accepting that price or even above 96.95 and holding it, building above it and not immediately wicking back, the odds shift toward a breakout continuation. But if Bitcoin gets rejected here today or tomorrow, you know, the longer the time frame that it holds, the more solid it is. So, if it continues above 96 today, 97.5, great. especially above 97.5. If we can turn that 50W week into a support zone versus resistance zone, then we're looking really good. And that's when our whole strategy will start to change. That's when these videos will change. That's when my strategy will change. And if we can get the longer the time frame we can get to confirm above 97.5, the more we'll start to change up our strategy. But again, remember, if we get rejected and we go back below 95K, 94K on the daily or even be better on the weekly, then we know that we're kind of back to the same grinding. And this has all been essentially some sort of fake out or dead cap bounce. So here's kind of the checklist. Let's make this stupid simple breakout signals. These are your green flags. If the ETF flows stay positive for more than one day, well, it's been two days so far, but we'll see how it goes today. If it's not just one big day, but a sequence, that's how you know it's not just a calendar effect or a oneoff allocation shift. If funding stays controlled while price grinds up on leverage exchanges and if funding goes vertical while price stalls, that's not bullish, guys. That is a setup. Let me show you guys this on the chart real quick. We have been getting we've been getting higher highs and we've been getting higher lows as well as we keep going on this path. That is a directionally positive signal upward. And here's the fake out signals that you need to be aware of. The red flags. If price spikes into resistance and instantly rejects or if we wick, dump, and spend hours below the breakout level, that is weakness. If open interest stays high while price goes sideways, that's how you build a liquidation cascade in the opposite direction. If good news hits and prices can't go higher, well, that's a red flag. That's the market telling you the catalyst is priced in and liquidity is exhausted. So, if you want answers in real time, if you really care about the short-term price action, watch this like a hawk. The ETF flows print today and tomorrow. Is it continuation or a stall? That should tell us a lot. And the reaction to the Clarity Act headlines. Do we hold gains or do we fade? If you really really care to pay super attention because you're trading, then you need to look at funding and open interest together, a healthy trend or a crowded trade. And then again in that 95 to97 to $100,000 behavior. Do we get acceptance or rejection? We've been caught in this tight consolidation for a very long time. And this break looks like positive momentum that could have been this. And usually when you the longer you consolidate, the more violent the break gets in either direction. Right now luckily we see it's a positive momentum. And guys, if you've been watching the channel, we've been talking about this for a long time. All the macro conditions are there. Liquidity is up, tailwinds, and I've been talking about the this is not a four-year cycle obviously anymore. Oh, did we go into a bare market? No, we went into a midcycle correction in my opinion. I've been saying this all along. So guys, is this a breakout or a fake out? Right now, this is a breakout attempt with a real catalyst, but it's not confirmed until the market proves it can hold these levels after the squeeze and after the policy headline risk. Drop a comment, guys. Let me know below if you think this is a breakout or a fake out and what level flip. See you guys.",
