  "transcript": "Banter fam, happy Thursday to you all. Okay, \nFOMC came out yesterday. We did have a rate cut.   Market started to push up. Nice little trap \nin play. I want to speak about the trap and   the next entries within the markets. But most \nimportantly on today's show is I just want to   recap my entire strategy for the rest of 2025, as \nwell as what I think can happen in 2026 Q1 and Q2.   There's going to be an opportunity to sell out \nthe long-term bags on altcoins. And that all comes   down to pre-preparation of when you're going to \ndo so. When markets are red, it's very important   to set your targets on when you're getting out \nnow. Because when things start to go up again,   remember, we have not had the bull's response \nfrom the last couple of weeks of redness, right?   But when that happens, you are going to start \nchanging your thoughts. You're going to start   thinking bigger. And this is the perfect time to \nbuild a full strategy of how to capitalize on the   next move to the upside, because the next move \nis very likely to lock in Bitcoin's high, as well   as altcoins high, and possibly go into a 12-month \nbear cycle after that. So, I do see an opportunity   of money to be made over the next couple of \nmonths. But, it's very important to have a game   plan and a structure. So, in this show, I'm going \nto show you all of the different parts of what am   I doing, right? What parts of my portfolio am I \ndoing and when am I going to look to exit these   parts? So guys, happy Thursday to you all. Hope \nyou're all having a great day. Keep soldiering   through. Market is nice and depressing, may we \ncall it, but just keep pushing through. This soon   shall pass. I'm wasting time. Let's go. I try and \nhelp everyone in my space and this is what I get.   I try and fight for the Banter Fam brand \nchannel. Hit the subscribe button, like it up. Okay, guys. So, I want to go through a little bit \nof high time frame views. Before I do so, remember   very good specials at the moment with exchanges. \nBelow in the description, we have a WEEX link,   one of my most favorite exchanges. And you can see \njust by signing up, you get a bunch of free money.   So, if you're looking for a good exchange, \nokay, and some extra cash in a bear cycle,   right, you can see you can get up to $100 just \nopening up your accounts, right? If you deposit   $100 and hold it for more than three days, you \nget another $50, right? If you deposit $500,   hold it for more than three days, you get $80. And \n$1,000 more than three days, you get a $100 bonus,   right? This will also get you into our free \nschools, okay? And many products that we   offer just by using the link. So, big shout out to \nWEEX below as well as Pionex, guys. For me, bots,   I'm going to be speaking about bots in the show. \nBots for me is a way to automate your trading,   right? To take your actual structures and planning \nand put it into something that does it for you,   right? You will learn that on three clicks \nof a button, you can open up your own bots.   They don't even have to be leveraged, right? \nYou don't even have to leverage these bots.   But these things can handle emotions. So \nif you're struggling with emotions right   now and but you believe the market's in good \nareas, you can open up bots with no leverage   right now that can trade the range and survive \nthe volatility so that you don't make yourself   go crazy within this time. Use the tools around \nyou. Pionex bot links below in the description. Now let's jump through my plan for me. I \nhave not ever exited my altcoin portfolio   since I started in crypto in 2020, 2021, \nright? I've never exited. And to be honest,   it's been one of my biggest mistakes in crypto, \nright? Is I've just held things for way too long,   right? You got two different approaches here. I \nwould say an investment approach is looking up   anyway of 10 years. If it's 10 years, what I've \nbeen doing is fine, right? But ultimately, what   I'm looking for is to financially free myself and \nmy family, okay? And this space still has a lot of   evolving to do. So, if you look at the last cycle, \nwe had a way more aggressive altcoin run. Does not   mean that's not going to happen yet, but it hasn't \nhappened just yet, right? And that really made me   thinking, why am I holding 200 coins in my altcoin \nportfolio, right? Yes, they're good and stuff   like, but nonetheless, money just ain't going to \nthem, right? And that was a big thing for me as   well to learn when it comes to investing. Really \nchoose the blue chips and look at a way longer   term approach. Okay, but I'm getting to that \nstage now where it's time to start cashing out our   portfolio. Now, the rule is we do not sell on \nred and specifically multiple weeks of red,   right? I always get out in green. And I'm just \nletting you guys know that I will be getting out   up to 80% of my altcoins on this next push to the \nupside. I still think there is one more rally to   go and I do think it's the altcoin rally, right? \nBut it's important to know that this HODL type   of game as well, specifically tons of altcoins, \nis a very tricky strategy unless you have a very   high time frame approach. So when I finally exit, \nI think I will be adjusting my strategy slightly,   right? And I think I'll be taking a way more \nof a Bitcoin approach where majority of my   long-term will be into Bitcoin. And this is next. \nRight now, I'm not in that situation. I'm sitting   with hundreds of altcoins, right? But ultimately, \nuse these phases to start upgrading yourself. And   I'm starting to upgrade to say, you know what, \nin the future, maybe three coins max will be my   long-term. The rest I'm going to trade in certain \ndifferent ways. Long-term trading, short-term   trade, mid-term trading, right? But I'm getting \nout and keeping profits, right? I had incredible   SUI positions and great profits at some point. \nI never took them, right? I had great Solana   ones. I never took them. Why? Because it was this \nwhole HODL type of mentality. Okay? Where for me,   the moment I just started trading the market over \nthe last couple of weeks and kind of flowing,   right, my accounts have grown pretty quickly \nand performing way better than what my long-term   accounts performing right now, right? So, just \nletting getting you a nicer understanding. However, where we are right now, there is \nopportunity, right? There's opportunity for   another leg. I want to speak about my plays \nhere on Bitcoin. So, we now closing up on Q4,   right? We've had eventful year. We've had pumps, \nwe've had dumps, we've had pumps, we've had dumps,   specifically on Bitcoin, right? But the big signs \nthat I'm kind of seeing now is us kind of really   losing important trends, right? We've lost this \nover here. Giving me a little bit of idea that   we need to start getting ready for a high to be \nin for the Bitcoin cycle. Right? So, what tends   to happen is we tend to usually get two highs \nin a cycle. The first high was purely focused   on Bitcoin. Altcoins ran, but it was mainly \nfocused on BTC, right? Get money into crypto   because Bitcoin is the biggest token and biggest \nsupply of the market. This brings in billions and   billions if not trillions into the market, right? \nThen what happens is you get some sort of dip off,   okay? And then you have the altcoins that get \nreleased. For me, altcoins are there for exit   liquidity. That's just my opinion. I think there's \na lot of altcoins in the market that are very good   trying to make difference, but I think alt seasons \nor alt runs happen to bring millions of people   into crypto because Bitcoin doesn't. Bitcoin \nbrings in a lot of people but altcoins really   your memes, your this, your that, they bring in \na ton of people, bring a ton of liquidity and it   allows early buyers that were accumulating, right, \nto offload within the market. Okay, so for me,   the last two cycles we have seen alt seasons and \nI think there's a reason for that and I think we   still got to have a open eye that that's still \ngoing to happen, right? But you could see here   that there are two levels here. First one's the \nBitcoin pump, second one is the altcoin pump,   then we go into bear market. I feel that we \nare here somewhere. I feel there's still this   to come. Okay. And then I still then after that \nI do feel we go into bad territories. Right. I   was looking at the stock markets as well. I don't \nknow if 2026 is a great year for stock markets if   I must be honest. Right. Here's just the futures \nover here and looking at this high time frame. I   just look at this chart and I'm like this is one \nof the most scary, I wouldn't say manipulated,   but it's a scary chart. Right? This looks like \na damn memecoin or something crazy. And what you   don't realize at some point there will be a crash. \nThere will be something like this. Now if you look   at the biggest crashes we have seen, right, in the \npast that's the size of it. If you look at this   guys, I'm a chartist. When I see a wave like this, \none day something like that's going to happen,   right? And it's I'm getting some ideas that this \nmight happen closer to mid-end next year. Let's   see. Right. It may be this big. It may be that \nbig. Don't be surprised if that big one happens.   Okay. So, I'm not super, super, super happy when \nit comes to stock markets and we know if a stock   market pulls back 50%, we know what's going to \nhappen to crypto. I just don't think it's yet. I   still think there's more upside. There's a blowoff \ntop here. Then there's a big pullback incoming,   right? So, it's just again why I want to just \nhold altcoins through all of this stuff. If   I know that the rest of the world's also in a \nplace where a big pullback can happen, right? So, let's go back over here now. So, my plays, \nlet's go through Bitcoin here first, okay? Of   what I'm thinking is going to happen. So again, \ntwo highs. There's going to be two scenarios   that's going to play out here. So this one, we \nhad the higher high approach, right? This high   was higher than this one after that went into bear \ncycle. The cycle before that, we had a lower high.   I just want to show you guys here. Let's go to the \ncycle before that. Boom. We had Bitcoin go first,   altcoins go, and then we dropped off over here. \nRight? So it's either lower high or a higher high   incoming. Now, why I think the temporary bottom is \ngoing to be in on Bitcoin because I do think we're   going to have altcoins now run and I do think \nBitcoin is going to try reclaim, right? Remember,   this is a trend line that we lost and what fixes \nthis trend line is we break back into it, right?   Nothing is stopping that because what did it do? \nIt shaked out most the market, right? So, if we   look at this over here, RSI is at the bottom. Last \ntime we were at the bottom, we were here and we   did see at least a 50, 60% growth within Bitcoin \nthe last time we were here. Right? So again,   I'm not going to sit here and go full bear. The \nbearishness has already happened. It's time for   me to turn bull. Right? And there's two plays. The \nfirst one is the lower high. If it's a lower high,   Bitcoin goes probably below around the 105 to 110 \nand then we have that problem over there. We were   speaking about the bear, the bear drop, right? \nThen we have what they did to us last cycle is we   go higher and then we drop. Both scenarios for me \nis upwards for the next couple of weeks or couple   of months. Right? So what this looks like then \non altcoins looks like this. And this is exactly   my play as well. So again RSI is at the bottom \noversold. This was the last time we were here.   Before that we were here, right? You see what \ncomes and you can also see how fast altcoins wake   up when things go their way. Right? But this is my \nplay on alts. I do think this wave is going to be   smaller than what we anticipated, but I do think \nthere's still an opportunity to firstly offload   long-term and obviously use this next move to \nthe upside to make some cash. But this is my play   here. Okay, I think we're going to go a little bit \nsidewards now. Maybe a little bit of growth now   over the next week or two, but I think into Q1, \nwe're going to start accelerating quite quickly.   Okay, and I see us pushing all the way up to Q1. \nOkay, and I see us going all the way up to new   highs. Okay, I then see a rejection, second high, \nand Q2 to Q3 this might go on a little bit longer,   right? But I'd say around Q3 or so I am \nexpecting markets to start pushing down. Okay, so what that means for me is this \nis where the exciting part happens. Okay,   and I need to make sure that these moves are \nbig. I don't want to take on too much risk. So   you guys know I've been trading my accounts that \njust trades in and out. But then now let's speak   about the rest. Right? So in this area right here \nright now I am building grid bots and these bots   need to withstand at least a 40% drop. So they \nare very low leverage bots but I am launching   them here. Why? Because it keeps me in the game. \nI'm buying and accumulating in a good area and a   bot will not mentally drain you the way physically \ntrading drains you, right? Or physically getting   out and all these type of things. So bots for me \nI am launching. The second one is spot trades,   full spot. I'm even getting ready to enter some \nlow leverage trades which is 2x's. I will put   stop losses on these below these lows here. Very \nimportant. Okay. Low leverage entries and then   I'm using this piece over here over this next week \nor two to finish the last end of Q4 2025 passing   BitFunded challenges, right? Making sure that I \nhave a lot more money than what I got. Remember   when it comes to the BitFunded challenges, right? \nSays, \"One step passes.\" Now, I pay $99. I pass   one step, which means I need to get more than 8% \nprofits without losing 8% profits. If I lose 8%   of the account, the account closes. If I gain, \nI unlock $5,000 to trade with that I can 5x,   which means I can trade at $25,000. Okay? \nSo, these packages, whichever one suits,   whichever one works with the budget, amazing. \nBut I'm looking to pass as many of these, okay,   as possible. So you can see here, here are my \naccounts, okay, as possible so that I have money   when this market wakes up I have way more money \nthan what I got. Okay, so again BitFunded entries. Now let's speak about the next. When this starts \nto go up I ain't entering any more into the market   other than my trading account which will be a 2%, \n3% of my capital that I'll trade in and out. My   bots I will not enter any more bots. I'll not \nenter more any more spot trades. I'll not enter   any more long-term investments, nothing done. I'm \neither buying here, okay, or I'm not buying at all   for the next couple of months, right? So, this \nis where I'm accumulating. The moment we start   getting a spark up again, right, I automatically \nswitch into no more buying, where am I selling,   where am I going? So, here's my game plan, right? \nMy game plan is as we start rushing through close   to the high, start pushing through, I will be \nclosing the leverage positions. Bank in the money,   buy Bitcoin. Cheers. Right. I will be closing \nthe bots. I will be closing the spot trades   in this rally to the upside. I'm going to start \nshrinking the amount of exposure that I have in   the market. Not getting ready to exit my long-term \nyet. I'm going to exit my long-term during Q2,   right? Start of Q2. That's where I see the market \nslowing down. Okay. And that is where I'll be   exiting 80% of my altcoin positions. Only ones \nI'll keep is probably Solana and ETH. Just to   be a little bit more in the game so I don't leave \ncrypto forever. I still have something in there,   right, to keep it going. But that is where I \nam exiting. Okay. So this is all about buying.   This is all about exiting. The moment we get the \nspark off, I am done buying, right? And I truly   feel that this is a important lesson for many to \nlearn. We're not going to wait for this market to   go bullish to buy again. Guys have faith now. \nHave belief now. Have your understanding now.   Make sure that you can survive. Don't do high \nleverage. Make sure you cannot get liquidated,   right? And get blue chips in the market. Be \npatient, okay? And that's it. Here I'm kind of,   I've done this for four years now and many \npeople want to kind of buy here, right?   Let's not do that, guys. Let's stay motivated \nand let's do this in these areas over here. And again, why am I so bullish on altcoins? \nBecause I still see a big collapse happening in   Bitcoin dominance. This is what I see happening. \nOkay, I see at any moment now dominance breaking   down to the mid-50s and I see in Q1 to Q2 next \nyear I see us going down to at least 45 to 52,   53%. Then I think we go into the bear market. \nSo the important thing now is to go through   your alts, right, and to start getting ready \nfor some TPs, right? So you look that if I have   a AVAX bot now, here's AVAX. Okay, when we get \nto this range over here, I'm exiting the bot.   When we get to exit in the long-term, right? And \nI would say a safe play on a lot of alts that look   like this. The middle is very likely where we're \ngoing to go. We might go above again. We might   have that crazy run. That's why I'm going to give \nQ2 for my long-term because my long-term is not   leveraged or anything like that. It can withstand \na little bit more, right? But set yourself these   major targets. And a key tool to use is the \nRSI. When this RSI starts tapping to the top,   it's time to start exiting anything that can \nget liquidated and do damage. Take profits,   right? Long-term concerts, all these different \nthings can kind of happen over here. When the   monthly, see the monthly, when the monthly gets \nto the top, that's where my long-term gets out   right now. Again, this might change a little \nbit to Q3. Maybe we see a little bit long,   but this is what the preparation is \nbefore it all starts to play out. Okay, amazing. Now, let's jump into some \nshort-term. Short-term just a rubbish rejection of   the FOMC. We had some hype. We dropped down. Um, \nlet's go here to Bitcoin. I don't think there's   much more pullback coming. I think Bitcoin go a \nlittle bit lower. It's around 88 or so. Then I do   think Bitcoin is going to push up again. Bitcoin \nis going to want to go capture all that liquidity   setting up over there. So, the best thing to do \nnow, okay, I got out of my trades just to show you   guys. So, I was in and I got out there last night. \nI went to sleep. We broke this trend. I'm like,   I'm out. Right. So, if we look at my month so far, \nI lost 5,000 in the first, then I won 45,000. Then   I made 2,000, lost 2,000, lost 1,000, made 10. \nJust pay attention to the ratios here. When I   lose, I lose 5K. When I win, I win 45K. Right? \nWhen I lose 2K, 1K, 2K, I make 10K. Do you see   how much stronger my wins are than my losses? \nRight? You see how much more strength they have?   And that's just because I keep fishing in the \nareas. And the big thing here as well, if you look   at this chart here, look how there is money made \nand then I take a break. Then there's money made,   smack, take a break. Look where make money, take \na break. Make money, take a break. See what I   do here? It's not just a chart that's just doing \nthis 24/7. Right? When I win or lose, I take the   damn breaks, reset, get myself back into track, \nand go. Right? And this is working really good. So my next plays I'm not in anything right \nnow. What I'll be looking for is it does   look like the market's going to take a bit \nof time to recover. I'm not bullish right   now for the day at all. Right? If I look at \nlet's say example Solana where we are now,   we basically just lost that. So what I think is \ngoing to happen is something like this and then   I think something like this. So to be honest, I'm \nprobably not trading the entire weekend. Next week   looks like a really good week to trade unless I \nsee something super super clear which I'll let   you guys know by tomorrow when we go live. Let's \nsee what's there. As it stands right now, I always   put in the top trend and you can see we are very \nfar from it. So this is where the market's going   to try to take your money short-term. Okay. So for \nme, this chart is going to probably flatline over   here for a couple of days unless I see something \nsuper clear. If we get here, I might dip my toes,   right? I'll track it down. I might dip. Other \nthan that, I don't want to give away any more   money. Right now, we are in a bendy road. You just \ngot to control the gas and the brakes and the gas   and the brakes, not just gas, right? Very, very, \nvery important. Um, then just again, shout out   to a couple more of the sponsors. BTCC, they also \ngot great, incredible deals right now. Remember,   we are going to give away a Rolex, right, to \nanyone that's using the links below. But there's   also tons of bonuses, right? You get bonus of \nup to your first deposit of over $500, right?   I think it's 10 or 20% bonuses. Okay, there's \na lot of opportunities over here. And there's   a lot of volume giveaways as well as you're \nachieving volume. There's a lot of great things,   right? And also a massive shout out to Bybit. You \nknow, I've been buying trading bots on my phone   quite a bit at the moment. Um, but also Bybit. I \nthink I got exciting news. I think Bybit's coming   to EU with uh Yeah, let's see. Let's see. But \nI heard there's good things there as well. So,   big shout out to all sponsors. Um, guys, these \nguys are still putting everything in, you know,   into a market that's like dead right now, \nright? We all work hard. We're all grinding   hard. And we know what that turns into. Guys, have \na fantastic day. Think long term. Start planning.   Start structuring. And do whatever you can to stay \ninvolved. Lots of love. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.",
