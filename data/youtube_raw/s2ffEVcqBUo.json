I'm going to show you what I think that \nannouncement is and how it can affect the markets.   Also, talking about announcements, we had the \ninflation. It's not really an announcement.   It's an inflation reading. We expected 2.7%, we \ngot 2.7%, and so the market hardly moved. Well,   actually, no, the market did move. But if you \nwanted to catch that move, I actually want to   show you a lot of our members actually did \ncatch that move, right? So, if you look at   what actually happened in that chart, I'll take it \nto a three-minute chart. You can see that when the   inflation numbers actually came out, we actually \ndid spike to 92,500 and then we pulled back,   and then we spiked up again. I'm going to \nshow you how you can catch moves like that. And then I want to talk about this commodities \nsuper cycle that's actually happening and whether   or not we can trade it, whether or not we've \nmissed the boat, and what the best way is to   actually get into this commodity super cycle. \nSo, another jam-packed show here on a Tuesday.   We got a jam-packed show for you here today. As \nalways, let's get the show on the road, guys. WGY, rise and shine. Lots to talk about \ntoday. Tons of stuff to talk about today.   At the end of the show, I also want to talk \nabout this Monero run because I think I know   what's going on here. I'll show you why. There's a \nlot of these privacy coins running again. So look,   in the first 100, you got Dash, which is \nnow in the first 100, Monero. And then if   you look at the top 200, you got Railgun. \nSo a lot going on here. And Zano. Zano,   we'll talk about today as well. Lots actually \nto talk about today. TradFi, altcoins. Yeah. It feels like we're back in a bull market, but \nwe're not back in a bull market. The reason why   we're not back in the bull market is very simple. \nAnd this is what most people are actually missing   here today. In fact, before I show you what \nmost people are actually missing here today,   you know what to do. Hit the like \nbutton, please. Just hit the like button,   please. It helps us get distribution if you're \nnot subscribed. Well, you can't be in the show   and then be commenting in the chat, bro. Like you \nand Bruno, I'm on to you guys. I can see you guys.   I see you guys every single day. It's like my \nbiggest fan club, but they also work for me. They   know that your salaries will be paid regardless, \nguys. Your salaries will be paid regardless. Okay, now the price of Bitcoin is starting to move \nup a little bit. Now, the reason why I said to you   that what most people are actually missing here \nis that we actually had a big level for Bitcoin.   And the reason why we can't break the 92 level \nis because if you go zoom out on the daily here,   I mean, this is massive. If we get back into this \nlevel, then we're back in the upward channel that   we've been in since, I mean, you could probably \nsay that that channel extends back to December   2022. And right now, we are back and we are \ntesting that channel. Just look at exactly   right now as it stands, we're just over the \nchannel. Now we did break over that channel   on the 5th of Jan. We got that 94,000 level \nand then we rejected. This is a big level.   So it's going to take us time to get through \nthis level. When we get through this level,   rest assured, it's going to take us up. \nI think we're definitely going to go back   to the $100,000 level. And then I think the \nkey decision point for Bitcoin as to whether   we're in a bull market or not in a bull \nmarket is on around that $107,000 level. Anyway, let's talk about today. So, the big news \nof the day, inflation numbers, not such big news   because they don't actually really matter. We \nexpected 2.7%. We got 2.7%. CPI was marginally   lower than we actually expected. The market didn't \nreally react. Why? Because there's nothing really   to react to. Regardless of what the inflation \nnumbers are, Powell ain't increasing or ain't   raising or decreasing rates when he's basically \ngot a subpoena against him and he's being   subpoenaed at the moment. And so the chances of a \nrate cut at the January FOMC, 95% no rate cut in   January, which is about right. Which is why at \nface value the inflation numbers don't matter. The reason why you could say they did matter \nis because remember there was the government   shutdown and so they never did a reading \nin October. In November it wasn't a real   reading. It was an imputed reading because they \nnever went into the field and got the inflation   numbers. They basically assumed certain numbers \nand this is the first real data reading. So the   relief is that inflation actually is a 2.7% if \nyou listen to them. If you listen to Truflation,   inflation's 1.74%. So long story short, this \nwhole inflation thing is pretty much over.   Rate cuts still forecast, I think to get \ntwo rate cuts this year. But a lot is at   play here because of Powell and what's going \nto happen and who's going to replace him and   yesterday's subpoena and everything \nelse that pretty much goes with it. Now, I said to you earlier that some \npeople actually landed up making money   at this inflation meeting and I watched it in \nreal time. That's why I want to talk about it   today for a second. So who made money? The people \nwho, it was so funny because if you break down,   if you look at the inflation number at \nthe Bitcoin chart and you go down to   the three-minute chart. So you can see \nthat right here is where the inflation   numbers actually came out. See that's where \nthe inflation reading actually came out. You   had about four minutes to make money. So you \neither caught that three-minute candle or you   caught that three-minute candle and there \nwas a ton of money to actually be made. Let me explain to you what actually happened \nhere. As the announcement came out, there are   algos that are programmed to trade announcements \nlike this, right? So the Algo basically says,   listen, if inflation is equal to or below, \nbuy. If inflation is above, sell. That's   basically how the Algo actually works. And what \nthese Algos are basically scrambling to do is   they're scrambling to get the news first, \nright? And as soon as the news comes out,   the news feed feeds the Algo and the Algo \nmakes the trade. And that's what happened   over here. Right? So essentially the Algo got \nthe news here and we went from there. From here   we went straight up. We had 3 minutes to make the \ntrade and then we went straight back down again. Now if you want to be competitive with these \nalgos, you need to be getting news at the   millisecond. Milliseconds matter when you're \ntrading this. That's why we built the News   Terminal. You know how this News Terminal works. \nI showed it to you guys a lot last year, but today   it was great because I was actually watching \npeople make money. As soon as the interest   rate news came out, if you would have traded the \ninterest rate news immediately, you could have   gone long or short within a matter of milliseconds \nand that would have given you the advantage. Now again, this news terminal is I think one of \nthe most powerful tools that you can actually use   if you want to be catching moves, especially \nnow in the market when the market's so quiet,   it's very hard to catch these moves. If you \nwant to, there is a link here which gives   it to you for $99 a month for the first 12 \nmonths. Now, usually it's $199, but today I'm   going to give it to you guys for $99. If you're \nunhappy after the first month, email me. I'll   give you back your money. But I think trading \nspeed, trading news now in a market cycle now   is a great place to be. And as you can see, I \nthink now the market's actually starting to run. Anyway, so that is the inflation news. That's how \nyou make money on inflation news and other news.   You got to be quick. The only way to be quick is \nto use a terminal like this. The thing with a news   terminal is that you're talking about milliseconds \nhere. Like this one was 497 milliseconds and this   is 350 milliseconds. You're talking milliseconds \nto actually catch the trades. So yeah, and you   can see what it does is it already highlights \nthe tokens that could actually move. And then   if you want to buy, it's like literally, I \ndon't know if I've got money in this account,   but let's try. Okay, I don't have money in \nthis account. If I had money in this account,   would literally go straight in and you'd \nbe trading in a matter of milliseconds. All right, so that's the first part of it and \nthat's the first announcement of the day. It's   the inflation announcement. Yeah, I saw this \nand I don't know how big this announcement is,   but there is one thing that I'm actually a little \nbit worried about in the markets and one thing   that I guess could ruin the pump that we're \ncurrently experiencing. And I really hope we   don't ruin the pump, but there is one thing that \ncould actually ruin the pump and that is this. I don't know if you guys saw this, but Trump, \nhe tweeted, he went on Truth Social yesterday   and he said: \"The actual numbers that we \ncould have to pay back if for any reason   the Supreme Court were to rule against the \nUnited States of America on tariffs would be   hundreds of billions of dollars. And that doesn't \ninclude the amount that we have to pay back to   countries and companies that would require for \nthe investments they are making building plants,   factories, equipment for the purpose of \nbeing able to avoid the payment of tariffs.   When these investments were added, \nwe were talking about trillions of   dollars. It could be a complete mess and \nalmost impossible for our country to pay.\" He's almost saying if the Supreme Court rules \nagainst us and says that we have to pay,   it could cost a trillion dollars. He says anyone \nwho says that it can be quickly and easily done   would be making false, inaccurate, or totally \nmisunderstood the answer to this large and   complex question. It's not impossible, but if it \nwere, it would be dollars that would be so large   that would take us many years to figure out the \nnumber. And we're talking about even who, when,   and where to pay. Remember, America shines \nbrightly when the world shines brightly. In   other words, if a Supreme Court rules against \nthe United States of America, we are screwed. So Trump's basically saying that if the Supreme \nCourt rules against him when it comes to tariffs,   it's going to be such a scrambled egg, it's \ngoing to be such a big problem that there's   no way... that it's going to cost America \nmillions. And he says, \"We are screwed.\" Okay,   that's not good because tell you why it's not \ngood. There's a 27% chance that they're going   to rule in favor of Trump tariffs, which means \nthat there's a 73% chance that they're going   to rule away from Trump tariffs. If you \nknow that there's a 73% chance that the   Supreme Court is going to rule against \nyou. Now remember the Supreme Court's   not making any decisions based on Trump Truth \nSocial Posts. They're making decisions based   on the rule of law and the letter of the \nlaw. And he says if they rule against me,   we're screwed. And there's a 75% chance that \nthey rule against him. Hold on a second. He's   basically saying that if they rule against him, \nwe are screwed. Therefore, market should crash. Okay? If the president says, \"Listen, if this \nhappens, we're screwed.\" And there's a 75% chance   of it happening and then it happens, the markets \nare going to react badly. And this is what I'm   worried about because on Wednesday, which is \ntomorrow, we could get a ruling in the Trump   tariffs. And if it's not on Wednesday, it's by \nthe end of January. But what Trump is saying,   he's saying if it happens, we're screwed. And \nif we're screwed, then I don't want to be in   the markets. I don't want to be in markets \nif Trump's telling me it may be screwed. Now, what can happen in the ruling? One, they \nmay rule that tariffs were affirmed. Then there   could be a complete invalidation of tariffs, \nor there could be some tariffs were legal,   some tariffs were not legal. Right now, I don't \nthink that they're screwed because it's only $139   billion. Now, Trump's bringing in all these \nfactories and everything else. Ultimately,   the legal or illegal tariffs are $139 \nbillion in 2025. And this is the number   that they have to repay back. I think he's \nover-sensationalizing it because he kind of   wants to say to the Supreme Court, look, if you \nmake a bad decision on whenever the ruling day is,   if you make a bad decision, then you're \ngoing to crash markets. And he wants the   American people to know that, you know, he \nwarned them, etc. But, you know, justices   and judges don't make decisions like that. They \nmake decisions based on fact, rule of law, etc. And, you know, I just think that it was a... \nI mean, he's obviously highly calculated. He's   much smarter than me. He's obviously much, much \nsmarter than me. He's a better golfer than I am.   I don't know. I mean, I was watching actually a \nvideo earlier today about him playing golf with   his granddaughter. He's a very good golfer. \nBut I think that now he's playing a very,   very crazy game. Yes, I'm worried. I don't think \ntoday is going to be an announcement about that,   but let's hope that something \nlike that actually happens. I want to talk a little bit about \nwhat we spoke about yesterday and the   Powell Fed chair being attacked or subpoenaed \naround perjury and potential perjury. And what's   happening is now that basically all the European \nbanks have come out and said, \"Look, we stand   with Powell. We stand in full solidarity with the \nFed Reserve system and with his chairman Jerome   Powell.\" He and basically saying that they stand \nbehind him. It's people like Christine Lagarde,   Andrew Bailey, and all the Europeans as well as \nthe Koreans, the Brazilians, basically all the   central bankers around the world have basically \ncome out and said we stand in support of Powell. Right. Now I read this and it's very, very \ntrue. Mert says, \"In theory, crypto should   have printed on the news of the Fed instability. \nIn practice, we're all degens.\" Basically saying,   \"Listen, it doesn't make sense. It does \nnot make sense that what we got the news   that we got yesterday and the Fed is acting... and \nBitcoin is acting like Bitcoin is acting.\" I mean,   it's probably acting a little bit \nbetter today without the news. 97,750,   which is great. Now we, as you can see on this \nline, we're actually back in the channel now,   which is fantastic. Now we just need \nto close there for a couple of days. Anyway, so long story short, the commodity \nsuper cycle continues. Just look at silver.   Silver absolutely acting like an \naltcoin, like an altcoin. Gold has   actually outperformed the stock market now \nfor six months. And you know what the funny   thing is? The funny thing is that when \nyou start thinking about like, you know,   this is us guys. We we are the guys that are \nsupposed to be posting memes like this. We are   the guys that's supposed to be living these \nmemes because we chose crypto and crypto is   the riskiest asset class which is supposed to \ngive us the biggest returns. And you know who's   actually doing this now? It's the commodities \nguys. Now when I think of commodities guys,   I think of my friends at Kitco News. Like guys, \nit's these guys that are doing this right now.   It's like I can't believe that I used to watch \nKitco News and I used to think to myself,   you know, I'm so sorry for you guys that you guys \ninvested in gold and that you guys are boomers,   etc. And now these are the same people that \nare pretty much getting these kind of returns. And so like I'm getting this image in my head \nof those guys actually doing this and I'm like,   that's supposed to be us. You know that meme? \nIt's like that could have been us but you chose   crypto. Like, you know, that meme it says like, \n\"Honey that could have been us but...\" Yeah,   now Joanne who's one of the regulars to \nour show, Joanne, we acknowledge you,   we appreciate you, she says, \"It won't always \nbe them.\" And that's my whole thesis here. So number one, I want to talk about the super \ncycle. So why is gold and copper and silver having   a super cycle right now? Two reasons. The first \nthing is they found an amazing product-market fit.   And the product-market fit is the fact that \nnumber one, they are the original protection   against government shenanigans money. Two, with \nthe AI trade and the new trade that there is,   and let's just call it the AI trade, but it \nextends to things like AI data centers, drones,   basically new technologies. We cannot get enough \nof these commodities to actually power the chips,   the data centers, etc. And so when \nyou combine number one and number two,   which is number one that they found product-market \nfit in being sound money, and number two,   you find a product-market fit when it comes \nto data centers, and then the price goes up. And as the price goes up, what happens? \nBasically that's an advert for what you   like. Price is the best advertisement. \nSo as soon as your price goes up,   people FOMO into it. When they got the returns \nin gold, where did they go? They basically said,   \"Okay, we got the returns in gold now.\" And now \ngold generally... So if you think about gold   bull markets, gold bull markets aren't like \ncrypto bull markets which are one-year bull   markets. Gold bull markets are usually 10 years. \nAnd generally what happens with gold is that they   have a blowoff top. Now I want to show you the \nchart. So I mean that's what a gold bull market   actually looks like. You know you went down for 22 \nand a half years, you have a 10-year bull market,   and then basically what you realize is that the \nblowoff top or the peaks on gold are quite quick   in gold terms. So basically you get like a \ntwo-year stint in terms of like two years   and three months. The average breakout here is \ntwo years and three months of basically gold. Now, what we're seeing here is we're seeing that \ngold is very, very oversold in terms of the RSIs,   which it always does when we get to the tops. But \nthese tops can last for very long. As I've showed   you, these tops can last for 791 days, but then \nwhat happens is the money moves to silver and   then from silver, the money moves to the other \ncommodities. It's very similar to this chart over   here which is the old Secrets of Crypto chart. \nLet me actually show it to you because I know   I've got it here somewhere. If X is working. I \ndon't know, X has been a little bit temperamental   these days. Let's quickly just try and find you \nthat Secrets of Crypto chart. Generally, the   researchers would be watching the show but guess \nthey don't watch the show as closely anymore. So this is exactly what we're experiencing, \nbut we're only experiencing it right now in   commodities. So we had the gold run, which \nwas their Bitcoin. Silver is their ETH,   and it's outperformed gold by a lot. So \ngold goes up 70%, silver goes up 200,   300%. Which is basically how the flow of money \nused to happen in crypto. And then you go to the   large cap alts, and in this case, it's the \nlarge cap commodities. And then you go to   places like copper, like uranium, like lithium, \nand all of those are actually flying, right? Now, I mentioned to you yesterday that I actually \ntook a trade on copper, right? So, why did I take   the trade on copper? I'm going to leave this. It's \na long tweet around the copper thesis from it's   called Value with Prem. It's quite a big account. \nI don't actually follow, I must follow it. Also,   I see the same patterns happening on copper \nas happened on silver where first the silver   broke out, then the silver miners broke out, now \nthe copper miners are actually breaking out. I   wonder if I can actually show you. I don't know \nif I remember the code, but there is an ETF of   silver miners, and I want to show you... let's \nsee if I can find that silver miners ETF. Okay,   maybe it's this one, but I'm sure that this \none will show us the breakout. So, you see   they consolidate and then basically you have that \nbreakout. Now, if you look at the copper pattern,   it's exactly the same pattern. So, that's \nthe pattern over there. That's the trade. Now, how do you take this trade if you don't... \nYeah, someone says uranium will do very well.   Doesn't matter. Right now, we're in a commodity \nsuper cycle. I want to talk about this commodity   super cycle for a second. So, number one about \na commodity super cycle is it's the same as an   altcoin super cycle. They run for a long time \nand the majority of the returns come at the   very end when we're in the blowoff top. Make no \nmistake that right now we are in that blowoff   top and so you could expect a correction. The \nthing with corrections in commodities is that   they're not as violent as corrections in \nBitcoin. Why? Unlike crypto and Bitcoin,   when Bitcoin starts to crash, there's no \nbottom. And the reason why there's no bottom   is because you don't actually need Bitcoin \nfor anything other than to protect your money. When you talk about commodities, gold, \nsilver, platinum, palladium, uranium,   lithium, you need them for actual \nmanufacturing, whether it's weapons,   whether it's chips, whatever it is that you \nneed. And so there's always a bottom because   there's natural demand for the components. So \nunlike crypto, when crypto starts to crash,   everyone says, \"Oh my god, this is going to zero.\" \nWhen commodities crash, it's a different type of   crash. Why? Because it doesn't go to zero. It \ngoes to the notional value of what people need,   to the consumption value or the usage value. \nAnd so that is why it's a nice hedge to have   in your portfolio specifically because \nwe know how these market cycles play out. As I said before, make no mistake that we \nare at the end of a... we are at some point   in the end of a blowoff top on commodities. The \nquestion is, where are we in that blowoff top on   commodities and are we too late to basically \nget in? I'm still taking some bets. I bought   silver a long time ago. I did tell you on \nthe show when I landed up buying it. Now,   I've actually gone out and I've bought \nplatinum. How do you buy platinum using your   crypto money? So, as I mentioned to you guys \nyesterday and I mentioned to you guys again,   you can go to Bybit and in Bybit under the \nTradFi market over here. So, if you go to TradFi,   what you can see is you can actually get \ncopper. So basically that's copper. Now   you buy copper in lots. Okay? So it's copper \nlots. You can buy gold, you can buy silver,   etc. And you can buy them on leverage, but you \nbuy them here. See, I've got $50,000 of margin. I   can use the value of the margin. I can actually \nbuy these copper lots if you want to do that. Now, listen carefully because it's the first 50 \npeople only. If you want to trade copper or any   commodity on Bybit today, the first 50 people \nwho take a trade will get a $50 trading voucher   and you can use that voucher to take a $1,000 long \nposition on any one of the commodities or actually   any one of the tokens only. Oh, they changed it. \nOkay, it's the first 100 people. So, today amazing   specials both in the news terminal and actually \non trading commodities. As I said to you before,   we are investors. We're crypto investors \nprimarily, but we are investors. And if right   now the commodities are acting like crypto and \nwe understand market psyche, market psychology,   we know that this blowoff top can carry on for a \nlong time. It can hurt a lot of people on the way   down. But remember, when commodities crash, they \ndon't crash like crypto crashes. They don't go   90% down and go down to zero. And they can't do \nthat now. Not when you're in the age of drones,   AI super cycle where they need all the copper \nfor the data centers and all the silver and   whatever else. So I think it's a good trade. \nI think if you're one of the first hundred   people to cash in on this thing, you get a $1,000 \nposition. Which I think is a very cool position. Okay. Now, I want to talk about this, right? \nSo, Mert's tweet here which said, \"In theory,   we should have printed on news of \nthe Fed's instability. In practice,   we're all degens.\" Okay. Why do I want to talk \nabout it? Because it's frustrating that crypto   hasn't moved. And you could say like 2025 \nwas a really, really bad year for crypto,   but actually it wasn't. If you look at \n2025 and you look up until October 10th,   everything was fine. We were aligned to silver. \nWe were tracking silver absolutely perfectly.   We were probably about to have a breakout \nas you can see, but then we crashed. And   when we crashed, they went parabolic \nand we just didn't come to the party. So think about it like this. Think about \nlike you're going to a friend's party and   everyone's drinking, right? Everyone's drinking \nand then like at 10:10 p.m. you basically take   like 60 shots in a row and something breaks \ninside you. But then you can't carry on for   the rest of the party when they all go and \nhit all-time highs later. You don't hit   all-time highs. You basically go home and you're \nthrowing up and it's just not a good situation,   right? That's what happened. So, think about last \nyear as the party. Think about 10:10 as 10:10   p.m. And think about something broke in crypto \nand it broke really badly. Someone spiked our   drink. Someone destroyed our market. We destroyed \nour market. We destroyed everything. Thing is,   we've only been moving sideways for 90 days. \nAnd like Michael Saylor said, he said, \"Look,   you cannot measure the performance of a \nmarket because of a 90-day downswing.\" I think, and I'm gonna double down on this. \nI'm going to say my prediction is that on a   two-year time horizon, I think that when we \nlook back at this on a two-year time horizon,   I think that Bitcoin actually outperforms silver \nand gold and we'll forget about the last 90 days.   That's exactly what I think's basically going to \nhappen. That's my thesis. In the meantime, I am   hedging my bets and I'm taking some commodities \nand I'm putting the profits into Bitcoin. Now,   as Fred Krueger says, he says things don't move \nin a straight line. Bitcoin passed silver in   market cap in July. So in July, Bitcoin had a \nbigger market cap than silver. And then silver   did a 2x. So what's going to happen next? World \nmarkets are running. Stock markets are running.   Silver's running. Gold's running. Commodities \nrunning. Lithium's running. Everything's running. So my bet is we're going to get that catch-up \ntrade now. And what makes me more hopeful is   that we know that when these guys actually \ntop, then we get the big catch-up trade   here. So maybe what we need is we need the \ncommodities to start correcting as you can   see happened here and happened here and then \nBitcoin actually starts running. Hopefully,   hopefully that happens or at least \nthat's the thesis that I'm pretty   much looking at. Let me know what you think. \nThe long-term thesis is solid. It is solid. Now let's talk about the altcoins. So, I mean as \nI said to you guys the big narrative right now   is privacy. I mean so I think what's happened is \nthe following. I think pump.fun is also a good one   to be buying. So I think here's what happened. \nI think that the market punished Zcash. Zcash   was the front runner for the privacy coin. And \nthen the other day we had those shenanigans with   the dev team leaving and stuff like that. And I \nthink a lot of people actually caught a fright.   And because those people actually caught a fright, \nwhat you can see is that they went and scrambled   to Monero, they're scrambling to Dash, they're \nscrambling to Rail and a whole lot of others.   And so I think that this is a short-term move \nbetween one privacy coin and another privacy coin. And I think the narrative of privacy is going to \nbe a very, very big narrative. And you have to be   in that narrative. First, it's going to be the \nprivacy money. And you can see that running. I   think Zcash is going to have a massive catch-up \ntrade back to Monero and they're going to align   again and then you can see things like Rail, \nthose are all private money. And then the next   sector is going to be privacy privacy. So things \nlike Canton, ZK Sync. And today I actually bought   a little bit of this thing called Zano which is a \nlayer one open-source smart contract which is by   default private. I posted it actually in Front \nRunners. I posted it quite a few. Yesterday we   took a trade on Monero in Front Runners, you \ncan see it here. Yeah, this is when I traded   last night. It was under $600. Now it's $675 or \nat least that happened. And then I took a small   position on this Zano at about $10. Why? Because \nI just think this privacy narrative is going   to explode. And this is one of the tokens \nthat I actually want to have exposure to. Yes, there is like a nasty 15-minute candle. \nPeople are de-risking from Zcash because they   realize they're overexposed on Zcash. They're \nmoving out of Zcash into some of the other   privacy players, but all the big names, Barry \nSilbert, the Winklevoss brothers, everyone,   all the big names are still behind Zcash. So, \nthat's the thesis that I'm actually playing. Anyway, remember guys, if you want the news, \nthe thing, $100, $1,000 open position if you   use the Bybit first 100 users. 24/7 terminal, I \nmean, on days like this, the terminal is like,   you pay $99. If you don't make your $99 back in \nthe first month, then just email me. I'll give you   back your money. Anyway, I'll see you guys again \ntomorrow. Until then, trade well, my friends.",
