  "transcript": "If you are a crypto investor, there are two \nbig stories today that you want to talk about.   The first one is the headlines around Zcash \nwhere their entire development team has left.   The main developers have quit. Those are the \nheadlines. If you look at the charts on Zcash,   it has gone down about 20% in the last 24 \nhours. The next big headline is tomorrow   because the Supreme Court rules as to whether \nTrump's tariffs were actually legal. If Trump's   tariffs are not illegal, then what is that \nactually going to do to the market? Remember,   tomorrow is Friday and you know what happens \non Fridays with big news. Today is almost like   a two for the price of one. There is the \nZcash news and I am going to break it down   for you concisely and slowly. I am going \nto show you whether it is an opportunity   today or whether you should be selling all \nyour Zcash. Then we are going to talk about   the Trump tariffs and the Supreme Court ruling \nto decide whether or not it can actually move   markets tomorrow and how you should prepare \nyourself. Let's get the show on the road. Never a dull day if you are a crypto \ninvestor. If you are still a crypto investor,   let me know in the chat because it feels like \na lot of crypto investors have left. They have   given up. The sideways chop has knocked \nthem down. At some stage, we are going   to have a discussion as to whether we are in \na bear market or whether there is an uptrend   ahead of us or whether this is just a correction. \nToday is a big day and we need to talk about the   big news of the day and the big news which is \ngoing to happen tomorrow. The big news of today   undoubtedly is this Zcash story where effectively \ntheir developers have all just resigned. The big   question here is whether this is true or whether \nthis is FUD and whether you should actually be   buying the dip. I am going to break that down \nfor you because I have got a lot of inside scoop.   I have spoken to a lot of insiders and I can \ntell you exactly what is going on today and   then we will talk about the Trump tariffs.

I am waiting for the likes, guys. Let's talk about the first stories first. Zcash \nand this morning, investors woke up to these   headlines. Zcash developers quit, form new company \nafter board clash. Privacy coin Zcash sinks 20%   after core developer team quits. Zcash's main \ndevelopers walk out without warning. Zcash faces   its biggest test yet. This is what the chart \nlooks like. The chart, if we looked at Zcash   two days ago, it was at $500. Now it is 20% down \ntrading at exactly $400. It was as low as $377 on   the news today. Where did this news actually come \nfrom? Well, it comes from this tweet from a guy   called Josh Swihart. He says over the past few \nweeks, it has become clear that the majority of   the Bootstrap board members have moved into clear \nmisalignment with the mission of Zcash. He says   yesterday, the entire Electric Coin Co. team left \nafter being constructively discharged. In short,   the terms of our employment were changed in a \nway that it made it impossible for us to perform   our duties effectively and with integrity. We are \nfounding a new company, but we are still remaining   with the same mission. Josh is the former CEO of \nElectric Coin Co. and today I am going to break   down for you whether this is an opportunity \nor whether this is just a whole lot of FUD. In order for you to understand that, you need \nto understand the history of Zcash. Zcash is   a proof of work network like Bitcoin except that \nit is private. It was created almost as a faster,   cheaper, and compliantly private version of \nBitcoin. It was created by a bunch of founders   including a guy called Zooko. He created the \nZcash protocol through a company called Electric   Coin Co. This was the founders' company set up to \ndevelop the Zcash protocol. Fast forward to today,   the Zcash protocol is running and has the support \nof big names. Naval Ravikant is a big supporter.   Arthur Hayes is a big supporter. Mert is a \nbig supporter. The Winklevoss brothers are big   supporters. A lot of the old Bitcoin cypherpunk \nmovement seem to have taken on this new challenge   of creating private money, which is where Bitcoin \nhas basically failed us because Bitcoin is not   really private. It is anonymous because of \naddresses, but ultimately the on-chain sleuths   have tracked back lots of the transactions. \nEffectively, Zcash is private Bitcoin. Remember I said to you that this protocol was \ndeveloped in this company called Electric Coin   Co. and it is a proof of work protocol. In \na proof of stake protocol, the tokens are   pre-issued and given to investors. In a proof of \nwork protocol, the tokens only get released every   time a block is mined. Similar to Bitcoin, the \ntokens don't exist until they are mined. With a   proof of stake protocol like Ethereum, tokens \nare held by the foundation and the foundation   sells those tokens to develop the protocol. With a \nproof of work protocol, you can't do that because   you don't have pre-mined tokens. So Zcash had this \nmechanism where 80% went to the miners, 5% went to   the foundation, and 7% went to Electric Coin Co. \nto carry on funding the development of wallets   and other applications. For the longest time, \nZooko was part of Electric Coin Co., although   he did leave in December 2023 and he started a \nnew company also building on the Zcash protocol. Here is where it gets messy. In November 2024, \nthe system changed. The new change said that   of every block mined, 80% goes to the miners, 8% \ngoes to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG), and 12%   goes into a lockbox. A lockbox is exactly what it \nsounds like. Every block that is mined, the tokens   go into a box which is locked until they can agree \nwhat to do with the money. Originally, Electric   Coin Co. was getting 7% of every single block \nand now they are not getting anything. Where is   the money going? It is going into a lockbox. As of \nNovember 2024, there is no disbursement mechanism   currently defined. The Zcash community will need \nto decide upon a suitable decentralized mechanism   for permitting withdrawals. Now you are starting \nto see where the problem is. Electric Coin Co.,   which was building so many applications, all of \na sudden is not automatically getting the money. The founder, Zooko, left Electric Coin Co. and \nJosh Swihart took over as CEO. He and a bunch   of developers decided to donate their shares \nto a nonprofit organization called Bootstrap.   Bootstrap is a nonprofit organization meant to \nhold the shares in Electric Coin Co. What seems   to have happened is that Bootstrap, operating \nunder strict legal and fiduciary obligations,   had conflict with the team regarding \nexternal investment and an alternative   structure to privatize Zashi, the wallet. \nThe team of developers basically said they   couldn't work under all these restrictions and \nthey weren't getting paid or receiving grants   anyway. So they left. As Mert says, Zcash did \nnot lose anything. The Electric Coin Co. team did   not like their board, so they started the exact \nsame company with a different name and no board,   meaning they are now unburdened by \nthe politics. This whole thing is a   nothing burger. They didn't like the board, they \nweren't getting money from the protocol anyway,   and they started a new company to carry \non developing without the bureaucracy. The core devs are not gone. Electric Coin Co. is \njust one part of the Zcash development community.   There is Shielded Labs, the Zcash Foundation, and \nProject Techon. All of those remain independent.   Nothing has really changed. This would have been a \nmassive concern if the Zcash developers were being   paid by the protocol and all of a sudden they \nlost their funding. They weren't getting funding   anyway. This is a retail dump based on headlines. \nWe know that there are big names involved here,   like Tyler Winklevoss. He is retweeting messages \nsaying no one from Zcash has quit and the team is   more aligned than ever. Tyler Winklevoss is highly \nincentivized for Zcash to work because he runs a   digital asset treasury company that buys Zcash. \nIf you were responsible for millions of dollars   and your mission was Zcash, would you amplify a \nmessage that was bad for the protocol? It doesn't   make sense. Retail is waking up to these \nheadlines and in a low liquidity market,   headlines can scare. But after hours of analysis \nand speaking to insiders, this Zcash thing is a   nothing burger. Nothing has changed except that \nthe devs have moved from one structure where   there was a hostile board to another structure. \nIf you were bullish before, nothing has changed. Let's talk about the other big news which \ncan affect the markets tomorrow. Trump's   tariffs are on the line tomorrow \nbecause the Supreme Court could rule   as to whether the tariffs were legal or illegal. \nThis is a complicated case because Trump charged   about $150 billion in tariffs. In financial \nyear 2025, total tariffs were $216 billion,   but some were there before. The \nSupreme Court tomorrow may come   out with a ruling. There was skepticism from \nthe justices during arguments in November. It   is possible we see a split decision where some \ntariffs are upheld and others struck down. The   argument comes down to whether or not Trump is \nallowed to increase tariffs without Congress's   approval. There is a law called IEEPA that gives \nthe president certain powers in cases of economic   emergencies. It says the president may \"regulate \nimportation.\" Do those words mean tariffs?   Can the president impose tariffs even though \nthe Constitution gives that power to Congress? Polymarket currently says there is a 24% chance \nthey will rule in favor of Trump's tariffs,   meaning a 76% chance they will be deemed illegal. \nIf they are illegal, will Trump have to pay the   $150 billion back? Who do you pay it back to? \nImporters who paid the tariffs are taking Trump   to court to try and get their money back. We may \nor may not hear the final answer tomorrow. Even   if they rule it unconstitutional, Trump may find \nanother way to make them constitutional. Why are   we talking about this today? Because tomorrow is \nFriday and news on a Friday in low liquidity risks   a market overreaction. This whole story comes \ndown to whether that revenue was earmarked for   stimulus checks. I don't think we will get a final \nanswer tomorrow, but beware of low liquidity. All right, we have another winner in \nour Cast card competition.
