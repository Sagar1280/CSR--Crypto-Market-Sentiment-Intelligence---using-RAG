  "transcript": "The biggest bull market is setting up for 2026. I'm going to show you guys 10 catalysts that are about to flood liquidity into the market. I spent a lot of time doing the research on this. And I'll be honest, it made me very, very, very bullish for this year. So, I wanted to keep it short, punchy, and easy to share because a lot of people are going to miss what's starting to form right now. Today, we're going to rapid fire through 10 specific things that can push money into the system very, very soon, plus an 11th bonus one that has to do specifically with crypto. Taxes, data centers, defense, energy, the Fed, and a few others that are quietly lining up behind the scenes. [music] And the reason this matters for you, well, it's simple. If you understand where the money is being pushed first, you understand why 2026 could turn into a real bull market for stocks, Bitcoin, and the sectors that sit closest to the spending. By the end of the show, you will have a much better picture of why the administration is calling this the start of the golden age. So, without further ado, guys, let's dive in. The administration has even been calling this the start of the golden age. Whether you love that phrase or you hate it, the market only cares about one thing, cash flow and liquidity. Quick reminder, guys, this is education. This is not financial advice. And always do your own due diligence. All right, let's get into the first catalyst. Pipe number one, the Trump accounts. This is a policy pipe that literally pushes money into the markets. Here are the specifics. The IRS and the Treasury have guidance for these accounts, and the structure, well, it's simple. If you're a US citizen born between January 1st, 2025 and December 31st, 2028, the program is designed to seed the account with a onetime $1,000 contribution. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 per year. On top of that, and one detail matters a lot, the money is meant to be invested in funds that track the US stock indexes like the S&P 500 style fund, including ETFs. Now, Jess and I will have kids in the next year or two, and you guys can bet that that money is going straight into Bitcoin. The White House even floated an example outcome. They say if an account is fully funded at $5,000 per year, a child could end up with $1.9 million by the age of 28. Let that sink in for a minute. I know that I will be taking full advantage of this. What better way to set up your kid with financial freedom and a financial future than this example? And if it's in Bitcoin, it'll probably even do a lot better. That's a long duration of capital that's piped at putting more money and creating more asset owners. And of course, all of that goes straight into the markets. Pipe number two, AI infrastructure spending wave. This is corporate capex or capital expenditure. Real checks. Goldman Sachs says the hyperscalers, the biggest tech giants building the AI cloud, could spend close to $600 billion in 2026 alone. And Goldman's bigger number is 1.15 trillion from 2025 to 2027. And that's going to continue to keep flowing. Keep this in mind, the money doesn't disappear into the internet into oblivion. It hits the real economy. Chips, data centers, networking, energy, cooling, construction, manufacturing. That's the buildout stack. There's also a policy accelerator. The administration has signed an executive order aimed at easing data center buildouts. This is a spending wave that does not resolve in one quarter. It becomes an engine. And when that engine starts running, it tends to pull risk appetite forward across the entire market. And nothing is stopping this train, ladies and gentlemen. Pipe number three, the Fed and easing expectations. Markets are pricing an easing path into 2026, and a lot of analysts have been calling for three rate cuts in 2026. How many ever it takes, we know that Trump wants rates near or at 1%. Today, we saw the CPI fall to its lowest level since 2021, which paves a path to allow the new Fed chair an easier path to getting rates down. Kevin Hasset, who is pro- crypto, was just nominated by Trump as well. And when policy moves anywhere near that direction, it's rocket fuel for risk assets. Borrowing gets cheaper, cash pays less, and valuations expand. So, while we currently have the drama of Jerome being sued by Trump administration, and this will likely cause PAL to push back even further on any rate cuts. As we know, rate cuts this month are expected to not go down at all. Rates will remain stable most likely. That's what the market has priced in. The market can expect things to change meaningfully starting in May when Powell is replaced, but markets don't need to wait for the event to happen. They are forward-looking. Pipe number four, the balance sheet is turning up. And when I say balance sheet, I mean the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, the Fed's master ledger. It's mostly treasuries and mortgage back securities, aka MBS. When the Fed buys more of these, its balance sheet grows that pushes cash into the financial system, which is why I call it the plumbing. Rate cuts may be the headline, but the balance sheet is the plumbing. Now, there are two ways this turns higher. One is an emergency like in 2020 or 2023, banking stress when the Fed use facilities to stabilize markets. The other is a policy shift where the Fed slows or ends quantitative tightening, also called QT, which we know has already stopped as of December 1st of last year. If the balance sheet starts rising again in a non-emergency way, that's a big deal because it usually means conditions are getting less tight. Here's why you should care. When liquidity improves, funding pressure eases, markets breathe, and risk assets stop fighting gravity. Bitcoin tends to catch that earlier because it trades like a liquidity thermometer. It's the quickest moving asset in the risk asset category. Pipe number five, defense spending surge. This is one of the most direct fiscal pipes on the planet. Trump has called for $1.5 trillion defense budget for fiscal year 2027 versus $91 billion authorized for 2026. So that number just keeps going up. And here's what that means in plain English. That's a government-f funded order book. The checks go out, companies hire, factories ramp, suppliers get paid, and banks finance the buildout. Defense spending turns into contracts. Contracts turn into production. Production turns into financing. Financing turns into a sustained money flow through the economy. And it never stays contained. It spills into manufacturing, materials, energy, chips, logistics, and cyber security. This is not a small lever, guys. This is a structural lever. All right, guys. Let's take a look at this defense index. This is pretty wild here. But this is the VANC defense ETF. It's UCITS. Look how this has just skyrocketed as global tensions rise up. And well, for better or worse, guys, it doesn't look like global tensions are going to ease anymore right now in the foreseeable future with Department of War. So, up to you. Morality. If you want to make money off of defense, uh, well, this is looking extremely strong right now. I don't see defense. In fact, we talked about the budget only increasing. You know, again, not financial advice, just something you might want to take a look at. Pipe number six, cyber security budgets. The administration has signed an executive action aimed at strengthening US cyber security and cyber security is one of those categories that becomes a non optional when threat levels rise like they are right now. Budgets rise. If you guys want a simple proxy, check out this chart. CIBR is a NASDAQ cyber security ETF with about 33 companies inside of it. And let's check out to see how it's doing. So here's a chart for Cyber CBR. Now, this isn't the one that I personally would be the most bullish on, but I'm not a stock expert, obviously. But I'll tell you the ones that in just a second here that I like quite a bit more, but in this index, you are getting that exposure to 33 different cyber security companies. And you have someone like CrowdStrike who reports around 90% gross retention. That means customers basically don't leave once they enroll in these SAS models. Essentially, they keep paying year after year, which is exactly what you want in a security category. Cyber security spends have a way of compounding because systems get more connected every year. Now pipe number seven, nuclear and uranium buildout. This one in my opinion is huge. This is the energy side of the whole growth story. AI data centers need power. Industrial reshoring needs power. The economy needs reliable base load power, meaning electricity that runs 24/7. And the administration has been pushing energy independence while also leaning into nuclear energy big time. If you want a simple way to track the narrative, NLR is a broad nuclear ETF with around 29 holdings spanning uranium miners and nuclear utilities. Let's check that out. All right, guys. So, this is the VANC uranium and nuclear ETF. And as you can see from the beginning of 2025 kind of went around Trump made that nuclear executive order. You can see that this has gone from about $81 a share to 142 as of right now. But topped, you know, and I I I expect this thing, me personally, I'm very bullish in energy. We'll talk about which energy company I'm personally invested in. A lot of you guys who watch the channel often know that already, but it went to $165 from about 80. So it 2xed. And again, nuclear production is ramping up and obviously necessary. And I also think, you know, we got some big people like Elon Musk who were talking about building energy bases on the moon and data centers in space and building swarm. What is it? Dyson swarms around the sun, but that's going to take like a long time, right? What is going to draw the most sustainable energy in a short amount of time? It's going to be small and micro modular reactors. Regardless, this tracker is going to give you access to the most commonly traded stocks within the nuclear energy and the nuclear fuel facility. So, I personally like this. I think it's a good idea. Most of my audience, you guys are generally crypto investors. However, I think it is a good idea as we obviously point to some of these outliers where I think a lot of money is going to go into. Again, none of this is financial advice. Just what I'm looking at. This one NLR in the stock market is probably a pretty good bet. Again, not financial advice. So the thing about nuclear guys is like I said, you know, big nuclear plants like the ones we're familiar with, the huge ones that produce gigawatts, those take over 10 years to build or something like that, right? From approval to build out, they're usually over budget. They take a long time. Where I'm betting is more the small and micro modular reactor sector. If you guys have been following the channel for a while or you're a community member at Wealth L WLT.xyz, XYZ. If you're not, I suggest you go check it out because for me, I'm a seed investor in Hadron Energy, which is probably going to be the first to market with micro modular reactors and likely, again, not financial advice, they will start being able to produce and ship units in as little as the next four or 5 years, which the demand is going to be insane for energy and the big boys won't be producing units for probably the next 10 years or so. Also, Hadron, you guys can keep an eye on as well. It should start publicly trading on the NASDAQ this quarter. Pipe number eight is rare earths and strategic minerals. You probably been hearing a lot about this on the news lately. And this is a supply chain strategy expressed through money. Rare earths are the materials that sit inside modern tech, magnets, batteries, defense systems, and advanced manufacturing. There's an executive order described as immediate measures to increase American mineral production. Again, this is more money going to American companies looking for where Earth's red tape ripped off and being accelerated by the Trump administration. The whole purpose is reducing reliance on China for critical minerals. If you want baskets to track the sector, two ETFs that are wellknown in the market are RMX, which holds around 32 companies tied to rare earths and strategic metals, and DMAT, which has roughly 49 holdings focused on disruptive materials. Now, again, you can go check them out on your own. The charts look quite good there as well. For me, I'm personally more bullish in the nuclear and some other stuff coming up here as well, but you can check out those tickers if you like as well. All right, guys. Let's take a look at this rare earth chart. This is pretty sane. This is the VANC rare earths and strategic metals ETF. So, as you guys can see, by the beginning of 2025, we were about 38 bucks. And so, it's over 2x since then. Sure, the whole market is up, but these specific sectors are absolutely going wild. And you can see here also the runup since the beginning of the year since December since end of December. Look at this spike we have right here. And this is the very beginning of the market guys. Like if we expect this golden age to keep running and these are just being announced right now. And you see the headlines for wear for example and strategics. This is really one of the reasons that we're in Venezuela. This is really one of the reasons that we uh you know made the deal with Ukraine for etc etc. Right? And this spending is pretty much guaranteed moving forward as long as these deals don't get unwound, which they possibly could. Again, just trying to speculate here and assume some things about the future. All right, here you guys can see the other one for rare earth. This is the DMA Tinx guys. And again, uh this one just is a little bit less volume and so I think that the other one is probably a bit more solid to go to the REMX if you're looking for that. Pipe number nine, robotics capex cycle. Now, this is productivity capex. Companies spend here when labor is expensive and competition is tight. Morgan Stanley has highlighted that we are getting closer to profitability and robotics than most people think. This narrative progresses really fast. I'm watching closely, guys. And also, if you want a basket to track it, you can check out BOZ. It's described as about 50 companies in robotics and AI and Robo described as about 77 holdings for global robotics and automation. Always look at the big picture, guys. Robotics is not one product. It's a wave of spending across warehouses, factories, healthcare, and logistics. All right, guys. Now, let's take a look at Robo, which is the global robotics and automation index ETF by ARCA. And again, you guys can see this chart is skyrocketing from the beginning of 2025 starting off at 55. This went up is not up as others, but if you take a look over here, since this low, it's up almost 2x since then. Again, pick your pick your uh pleasure of what you like to follow, what you think you're bullish on. Again, you can also check out the bots one or what you guys can do obviously is you can go over here and do what I did and just start typing in robotics and then ETF and just see what kind of ETFs there are. So you can check out this one. This is from ARC uh and this is autonomous technology and robotics ETF. There's one I saw earlier with uh aerospace as well. So you can check out those ETFs. These are the sectors anyway guys that are absolutely exploding right now. And we know that there's programmatic buy pressure and investment in these companies moving forward. And finally, pipe number 10, biotech reaceleration. Biotech runs in cycles. During the co era, a lot of companies overordered supplies, then spent years working through inventory. West Pharmaceuticals said late in 2025 that the detocking phase is largely behind us. And when detocking ends, orders tend to restart. Funding tends to loosen, risk appetite tends to come back. If you want simple proxies, two common biotech baskets are XBI, which holds around 150 names, and IBB, which holds around 259 of the larger biotech companies. That's a cycle shift, guys. And the cycle shift attracts capital. All right, guys. And this is the XBI chart here. Talk about the biotech. This is State Street SPDR and S&P biotech ETF. And you can see this chart also going off the charts here. And before we wrap up guys, let's talk about a cryptoreated pipe that we cannot miss. The one that could give clarity to the crypto sector, the Clarity Act. This is a US market structure bill designed to finally define the rules of the road for crypto. What counts as a security? What counts as a commodity? And which agency is in charge? Uncertainty is a tax. When the rule book is unclear, big money hesitates. Funds wait. Banks stall. Now, here's why this matters right now. The Clarity Act is moving into Senate markups on January 15th. That's the session where senators literally edit the bill line by line and vote to advance it. It's the first real decision point. The goal is simple. Define what is a security, what is a commodity, who regulates what, what we can do in the industry, what we can't do, what can what can funds invest into, what can retail investors do, how is this asset treated. We have had no idea. And when we have clarity on this, a whole new market of money that has been waiting on the sidelines because they have not had the clarity and they've got too much money and too much to lose to be speculating in a market that doesn't have any regulatory clarity around it can finally start participating. And I believe this is going to unlock a huge wave of capital that we haven't seen before. not just to invest in the assets that are currently trading on the market but also to invest in new companies building in the market and also companies who have had existing infrastructure who are successful who are building who have tons of revenue ones that have raised series A or publicly traded who believe that their business would be more efficient brought onto blockchain and now they have clarity to do so without getting in trouble that whole thing is a really big deal that I think a lot of people aren't taking into consideration for the first time an American history. Finally, we have clarity on what can and cannot be done and will unlock all this capital on the sidelines and big companies who have been waiting for this to happen. So guys, that's the map. 10 liquidity pipes and a bonus crypto catalyst. You've got policy programs with explicit dollar figures. You've got corporate capex in the hundreds of billions. You've got fiscal spending talk in hundreds of billions per year. And you've got monetary conditions leaning easier. Let's not forget about the tax refunds that we talked about yesterday. If you guys haven't seen the show from yesterday, I'll leave a thumbnail for it at the end of this video. I suggest that you watch it. It goes into a lot of detail about why again also about why 2026 is going to be the year of the golden age. So guys, in a year like this, the goal is simple. Track where the spending is persistent, where policy is committed, and where the buildout takes years.
